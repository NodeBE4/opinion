<p>There are so many levels on which this is disgusting, beyond the obvious barbarity to which someone’s household pet was subjected.</p>

<p>The fact that this specific dog responded to their command strongly suggests their personal involvement in illegal dogfighting, and use of that specific dog for engagement in dogfighting.  A domesticated dog does not naturally or instinctively attack other animals, much less kill them or attempt to kill them on command.  That kind of aggression, and specifically in response to a command, that particular dog demonstrated has to be trained.  It’s hard to do, as well.  Dogfighting is the sole purpose for which any dog is trained to kill other animals like that, and specifically to do that in response to a command.</p>

<p>Training a dog to kill small animals on command means that a lot of other animals have already been killed by it.  Smaller, weaker dogs and cats are often “adopted” under false pretexts for use as “bait” animals, to train a dog to respond like that.  There is no telling how many other household pets have been mauled to death under like circumstances by that animal.  Or how many other such dogs these people have trained.</p>

<p>People should absolutely have the choice of whether to wear a mask in any context, including on commercial flights.  No one is saying otherwise.</p>

<p>But there are things people fail to consider, because they don’t think things through.</p>

<p>Airline employees, particularly flight attendants, have been the subject of untold harassment for quite some time.  Sometimes even rising to the level of physical violence.  Airlines themselves have incurred tremendous costs associated with enforcing these futile mandates, whether from delayed flights or in connection with all the variously related legal liabilities.</p>

<p>Those costs make it more expensive for consumers to fly, because the airlines have to pass those costs off to consumers.  They also make the risk of air travel much higher, by substantially increasing the risk of confrontation between passengers and crew or other passengers.</p>

<p>So it’s not enough to just say “masks on airlines!  Because we think they matter!”  The whole picture has to be considered, namely in view of whether masks are redundant or futile by other measures.</p>

<p>It turns out that commercial aircraft have really excellent air filtration systems.  This is necessary, because the air you breathe on a plane is recycled after being filtered through medical-grade air purification methods that are vastly more effective than any commercially available mask.  Air is cycled through the cabin at rates that prevent any aerosolized viral material from accumulating in the cabin, which is the primary modality of infection.</p>

<p>On trains, busses or in other contexts, the same can’t be said.  But for planes, those costs are incurred without any added benefit to consumers whatsoever.</p>

<p>It is safe to go “maskless” regardless of whether you are vaccinated.

<p>So, the brigading begins.  A review of history will prove <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/t1hvgo/cdc_changes_mask_guidance/">salutary</a>.</p>

<p>There is nothing to which the CDC can point, to substantiate their changes in “mask” messaging. Their initial guidance on masks was based on a combination of incompetence, politics and pseudoscience. The fact that this behavior was normalized doesn’t mean it was empirically supported, or ever was. It just means a bunch of people with purported letters after their name said to do something and then they did it.</p>

<p>The CDC’s initial purported “guidance” on this issue was conspicuously devoid of all the types of scientific evidence needed to justify this type of recommendation. For example, if you’re going to recommend “masks” to prevent transmission of COVID, then you need to undertake at least some kind of analysis to determine what masks are out there and how they perform. Then you need to set up some independent criteria so that masks can be graded according to their performance. This needed to happen for both modalities of transmission recognised by current research (read: respiratory droplets and aerosolized molecular viral particles). To do so, you’d need a whole team of fluid dynamics experts, at the very least, to evaluate performance both generally and in specific settings.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort happened. Instead, all that happened was an incompetent bureaucrat who later declared himself to be “the science,” as if science works that way. Hint: it does not. If you’re going to hold out devices as suitable for particular medical purposes, you have to have evidence to do that. Otherwise, you’re engaged in what amounts to fraud in this country. We do not let people just make things up and offer them to the public, under circumstances where the public can rely on those misrepresentations to their detriment, without facing legal risk.</p>

<p>However, no shortage of crackpot pseudoscience <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/t1hvgo/cdc_changes_mask_guidance/hyj4jru/">purports</a> to justify this politically driven nonsense.   That junk “science” includes, but is hardly limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106e1.htm?s_cid=mm7106e1_w">Andrejko 2022</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Review of the the first sentence of this article’s summary is fatal.  Upon reading it, you will learn that “[f]ace masks or respirators (N95/KN95s) effectively filter virus-sized particles in laboratory settings. The real-world effectiveness of face coverings to prevent acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been widely studied.”  Realize that “filtering” — according to some vague, incoherent level of efficacy — molecular viral particles that are aerosolized is not the same thing as actually reducing community spread or reducing the probability that you will contract COVID-19.  Hence the second sentence.</p>

<p>The sole context where reducing community spread or reducing the probability that you will contract COVID-19 was purportedly evaluated, was in Bangladesh, that study being <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9069">Abaluck 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Except that study did not show masks work.  In fact, its data plainly and clearly says the opposite based on the lack of any statistically significant difference between the control and treatment groups.</p>

<p>According to the authors, what they actually found was that “[m]ask distribution with promotion was a scalable and effective method to reduce symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections,” based on meager differences in “symptomatic seroprevalence” among certain cohorts.</p>

<p>Which is a nice way to use fancy language to say that mask wearing is probably associated with some unknown external factor, but they failed to find evidence indicating that masks themselves are causally associated with any identifiable benefit relating to reducing COVID community spread.  This is a case study in fake science.</p>

<p>As most will readily ascertain upon reading the Andrejko 2022 article, its results are consistent with what the underlying data out of Bangladesh indicate.  It only finds that “use of a face mask or respirator in an indoor public setting was associated with lower odds” of a positive PCR test.</p>

<p>I will leave for another day the problems with their criteria for what they’re counting as a positive PCR test as compared to what others have.  The point is that your article fails to provide any evidence whatsoever that masks themselves are causally associated with any identifiable benefit relating to reducing COVID community spread.</p>

<p>As in Bangladesh, the act of wearing masks might make people engage in other behaviour which may to some unknown extent have some unknown result that reduced the probability of contracting COVID.  But that’s it. These so called “studies” does not say what media report they says.</p>

<p>This exemplary “narrative review,” which another user once linked for the purpose of “refuting” what I have said, is worthless.  They undertook no research and therefore didn’t move the ball forward relating to the science of mask efficacy in any way.</p>

<p>Instead, they went out and searched on Google Scholar or somewhere else to find all the worthless articles that have been published on this issue, relating to mask mandates and usage, for the purpose of offering what they hold out as no more than a public policy recommendation.</p>

<p>As an example of that article’s unmitigated worthlessness, review one of their purported public policy recommendations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control . . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hilariously, this article is recommending cloth masks at this stage in the game, despite the complete absence of evidence to support their efficacy along the lines of any metric, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DrLeanaWen/status/1473045198980665344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1473045198980665344%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-41205633983298031174.ampproject.net%2F2110212130002%2Fframe.html">even this pundit doctor</a> has been forced to concede that cloth masks do not work.  The CDC has “clarified” its stance on cloth masks and there is literally no one on this earth who can even pretend their efficacy for any COVID-related purpose is empirically supported.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all the studies that ever found any such benefit might be even associated with cloth-mask wearing suffer the same deficit as the study in Bangladesh.  In the first instance, the data state that virus is as virus does.  Which is the norm.  Not the exception.</p>

<p>But to the degree there is any difference from the control group, that difference is only attributable to external factors, which include as I said above, the fact that wearing masks might make people engage in other behaviour which may to some unknown extent have some unknown result that reduced the probability of contracting COVID.</p>

<p>Evidence to support the alleged efficacy of masks themselves remains unobtained.</p>

<p>Now I know some have probably googled some relevant terms and tried to find something they thought would contradict what I said.  But none who have brigaded this thread even tried to link anything.</p>

<p>If they did, they will struggle to find contrary evidence.  Because the state of the science is exactly where I said it was.</p>

<p>For too long, we have allowed reckless use of adjectives to imprecisely and improperly characterize data that it is obviously not understood. Mindless use of adjectives to characterize data in a vague and unsupported way is no longer going to be permitted.</p>

<p>Particularly where, as here, those characterizations are used in connection with post hoc speculation.</p>

<h3 id="200-unofficial-daily-update-for-2022-03-25-1309-new-cases-submitted-on-2022-03-26-0200200800">200: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/tntvxr/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220325_1309_new/">Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-03-25. 1309 New Cases.</a>, submitted on 2022-03-26 02:00:20+08:00.</h3>

<p>These daily updates have ceased to be useful, to the limited extent they ever were.  It is exhausting to see mindless speculation about what isolated events mean, when data are viewed at <em>this</em> level of resolution.</p>

<p>In the first instance, whatever utility viewing this data initially demonstrated was severely undermined by, among other things, the very nature of what it reflects (as compared to what it does not reflect).  Based on global trends alone, no competent epidemiologist can continue to claim that COVID will not become endemic.  The sole remaining question is when, politically, stating that recognition becomes feasible.</p>

<p>Further, vaccines are imperfect but remain the best available option to prevent hospitalization for adults who have not been infected.  Proposed alternatives of any kind (other than ventilation/HVAC filtration improvements) lack any empirical support whatsoever, as I and numerous others have repeatedly explained.</p>

<p>Moreover, to the extent people do not want a vaccine and thereafter become hospitalized, the remedy is outpatient care, which the FDA has remarkably acknowledged is feasible more than six fiscal quarters too late.</p>

<p>Removed.  This discussion is better situated in the context of a empirical evidence, including for your question’s implication that COVID “cases” are rising.</p>
