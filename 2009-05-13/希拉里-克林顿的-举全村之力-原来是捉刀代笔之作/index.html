      Ghostwriter controversy
     
        Clinton has been criticized for not giving credit to a ghostwriter in connection with 
      It Takes a Village
      . The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman.[8] When the book was first announced in April 1995, 
      The New York Times
      reported publisher Simon &amp; Schuster as saying “The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct a series of interviews with Mrs. Clinton, who will help edit the resulting text.”[9]           Feinman spent seven months on the project and was paid $120,000 for her work.[10] Feinman, however, was not mentioned anywhere in the book. Clinton’s acknowledgment section began: “It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out.”[11] During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, “I actually wrote the book … I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word.”[2] Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of “connecting paragraphs”, while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand.[2]             This led Feinman to complain at the time to 
        Capitol Style
        magazine over the lack of acknowledgement.[12] In 2001, 
        The Wall Street Journal
        reported that “New York literary circles are buzzing with vitriol over Sen. Clinton’s refusal, so far, to share credit with any writer who helps on her book.”[13] Later, in a 2002 article for 
        The Writer’s Chronicle
        ,[14] Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related that the project with Clinton had gone smoothly, producing drafts in a round-robin style. Feinman agrees that Clinton was involved with the project, but also states that, “Like any first lady, Mrs. Clinton had an extremely hectic schedule and writing a book without assistance would have been logistically impossible.” Feinman reiterates that her only objection to the whole process was the lack of any acknowledgement. A 2005 Georgetown University web page bio for Barbara Feinman Todd states that It Takes a Village was one of “several high-profile books” that she has “assisted, as editor, writer and researcher.”[15]


      
      至少提供了一些事实报道。只要看看12万美元的价格就明白了，别的其实无须多说。     附带说明，本人对此事并无任何争论的兴趣。我只是怀疑，一些国人似乎并不完全清楚什么叫做“剽窃”（plagiarism）。对此感到迷惘的读者不妨看看波斯纳的  《论剽窃》  （  
      The Little Book of Plagiarism
       ），一本很有意思的小书，（又是广告，哈哈！）精于此道的专家学者和“希粉”们请绕行。谢谢。

Ms. Feinman will conduct a series of interviews with Mrs. Clinton, who will help edit the resulting text.”[9]           Feinman spent seven months on the project and was paid $120,000 for her work.[10] Feinman, however, was not mentioned anywhere in the book. Clinton’s acknowledgment section began: “It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out.”[11] During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, “I actually wrote the book … I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word.”[2] Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of “connecting paragraphs”, while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand.[2]             This led Feinman to complain at the time to 
        Capitol Style
        magazine over the lack of acknowledgement.[12] In 2001, 
        The Wall Street Journal
        reported that “New York literary circles are buzzing with vitriol over Sen. Clinton’s refusal, so far, to share credit with any writer who helps on her book.”[13] Later, in a 2002 article for 
        The Writer’s Chronicle
        ,[14] Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related that the project with Clinton had gone smoothly, producing drafts in a round-robin style. Feinman agrees that Clinton was involved with the project, but also states that, “Like any first lady, Mrs. Clinton had an extremely hectic schedule and writing a book without assistance would have been logistically impossible.” Feinman reiterates that her only objection to the whole process was the lack of any acknowledgement. A 2005 Georgetown University web page bio for Barbara Feinman Todd states that It Takes a Village was one of “several high-profile books” that she has “assisted, as editor, writer and researcher.”[15]


      
      至少提供了一些事实报道。只要看看12万美元的价格就明白了，别的其实无须多说。     附带说明，本人对此事并无任何争论的兴趣。我只是怀疑，一些国人似乎并不完全清楚什么叫做“剽窃”（plagiarism）。对此感到迷惘的读者不妨看看波斯纳的  《论剽窃》  （  
      The Little Book of Plagiarism
       ），一本很有意思的小书，（又是广告，哈哈！）精于此道的专家学者和“希粉”们请绕行。谢谢。

      <blockquote>
        <p>……</p>
        <p>相比于教科书的情况，名义作者是政客、明星但实际上是捉刀人代笔的书和司法意见书之间有更多相似之处。（明星博客是最晚近的代笔明星写作的例子。）这里没有受害者。捉刀代笔人获得了报酬，而且由于不存在对于原创性的期待，公众也谈不上受愚弄。然而，对于书的捉刀代笔人的认同已经日渐普遍了，在这种情况下，如果不提及捉刀代笔人，就会给公众造成一种明星自己写作的印象，比如说希拉里·克林顿的书 <a href="http://www.amazon.cn/mn/detailApp/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ideobook&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;asin=B00243GXFM&amp;camp=536&amp;creative=3132&amp;creativeASIN=B00243GXFM"> 《举全村之力》 </a> （ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SARD92?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=oceintelleweb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001SARD92"> <em>
       It Takes a Village

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>
      Ghostwriter controversy
     </strong></p>
        <p>Clinton has been criticized for not giving credit to a ghostwriter in connection with <em>
      It Takes a Village
     </em> . The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman.[8] When the book was first announced in April 1995, <em>
      The New York Times
     </em> reported publisher Simon &amp; Schuster as saying “The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct a series of interviews with Mrs. Clinton, who will help edit the resulting text.”[9]           <p>Feinman spent seven months on the project and was paid $120,000 for her work.[10] Feinman, however, was not mentioned anywhere in the book. Clinton’s acknowledgment section began: “It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out.”[11] During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, “I actually wrote the book … I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word.”[2] Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of “connecting paragraphs”, while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand.[2]             <p>This led Feinman to complain at the time to <em>
        Capitol Style
       </em> magazine over the lack of acknowledgement.[12] In 2001, <em>
        The Wall Street Journal
       </em> reported that “New York literary circles are buzzing with vitriol over Sen. Clinton’s refusal, so far, to share credit with any writer who helps on her book.”[13] Later, in a 2002 article for <em>
        The Writer’s Chronicle
       </em> ,[14] Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related that the project with Clinton had gone smoothly, producing drafts in a round-robin style. Feinman agrees that Clinton was involved with the project, but also states that, “Like any first lady, Mrs. Clinton had an extremely hectic schedule and writing a book without assistance would have been logistically impossible.” Feinman reiterates that her only objection to the whole process was the lack of any acknowledgement. A 2005 Georgetown University web page bio for Barbara Feinman Todd states that It Takes a Village was one of “several high-profile books” that she has “assisted, as editor, writer and researcher.”[15]</p>

      <p>至少提供了一些事实报道。只要看看12万美元的价格就明白了，别的其实无须多说。 <br /> <span id="more-856"> </span> <br /> 附带说明，本人对此事并无任何争论的兴趣。我只是怀疑，一些国人似乎并不完全清楚什么叫做“剽窃”（plagiarism）。对此感到迷惘的读者不妨看看波斯纳的 <a href="/669/posner-little-book-of-plagiarism/"> 《论剽窃》 </a> （ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037542475X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=oceintelleweb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=037542475X"> <em>
      The Little Book of Plagiarism
     </em> </a> ），一本很有意思的小书，（又是广告，哈哈！）精于此道的专家学者和“希粉”们请绕行。谢谢。</p>
