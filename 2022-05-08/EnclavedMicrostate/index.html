<p>The thing of course is that these infantry blocks were mainly used to feed reserves into skirmish lines that performed the bulk of the firing, and to move in with the bayonet once the enemy formation was sufficiently depleted that it could be driven off the field. If you were going to be firing, you’d either send a skirmish force ahead, or form out in lines if you were trying to maximise fire. Blocks are not good for shooty action.</p>

<p>What’s actually changing in practical terms? Speaking just superficially, my understanding is that in an agency arrangement, the agency takes a cut of the talents’ revenues in exchange for providing centralised management, technical and marketing resources, while in a network, the network… takes a cut of the talents’ revenues in exchange for providing centralised management, technical and marketing resources. Is it ‘going indie’ in the sense that all of the staff are leaving but the talents are retaining their IP and maintaining a mutual affiliation but without a management structure?

<p>In my view 黑 would also work – the Amur River, for instance, is also known as 黑龍江, so there’s plenty of precedent for just using that. Also, seeing as it’s supposed to be in Cantonese, tonally I’d argue <em>dai6 hak1 lung4</em> sounds better than <em>dai6 jyun4 lung4</em> – the latter has three low held tones while the former has a nice low-high-low contour.</p>

<p>I did plan this week to write something original but didn’t make the time in the end, so, er, it’s repost time again! Yay!</p>

<hr />

<p>Perhaps my favourite historical painting is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Album_of_the_Yongzheng_Emperor_in_Costumes_8.jpg"><em>The Yongzheng Emperor Hunting a Tiger</em></a>, composed by anonymous court painters at some point during his brief reign (1722-35).</p>

<p>It’s a fascinating portrait for a number of reasons, not least the fact that it depicts the emperor in an attempt at Western garb (modelled mainly on Louis XIII and XIV of France), and wielding a trident of uncertain design but definitely distinct from the single-broad-bladed Manchu tiger-hunting spear <a href="https://www.mandarinmansion.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/tiger-spears.jpg">(see here)</a>. The costume is probably the most immediately striking part, and suggests for one that the costume was not actually modelled for, and for another that there was minimal if any input from Jesuit courtiers, some of whom did see employment as court painters though most prominently under Yongzheng’s son the Qianlong Emperor. In all likelihood, the painters only had a few Jesuit-sourced portrait busts for reference, which is reflected in the complete stylistic mangling the further down the costume goes: the waistcoat and overcoat become rather flappy below the waist, and are held together by a tied cord (similar to Japanese <em>haori</em>) instead of a leather belt, while the leg and footwear are of decidedly Sino-Manchurian style.</p>

<p>But the context is in many ways equally fascinating: this portrait forms part of what was originally a set of fourteen paintings, collated in an album titled, rather descriptively, <em>The Yongzheng Emperor in Costumes</em>, depicting the emperor in various garbs a various people, some mythic, some historical, some generic. On one level, the tiger-hunting portrait’s depiction of the emperor as a French aristocrat is pretty par for the course in an album that also portrays him, among other things, as a Tibetan lama in meditation, a Persian archer hunting birds, a Daoist magician summoning a dragon, and a Chinese fisherman daydreaming on the shore. But what makes it weird is that the act of tiger-hunting does have some significance in Chinese religious art: one of the eighteen Arhats in Chinese Buddhism (and one of two to be added to the ranks of the previously sixteen Arhats in the late Tang), often associated with Maitreya, is also known as Subduing-Tiger or Taming-Tiger, and depictions of Maitreya subduing a tiger were relatively common as a motif in this part of the Qing. What we have then is a fascinatingly weird blend of established Chinese Buddhism with Qing multiculturalism to… uncertain effect.</p>

<p>One aspect to consider is that although the Yongzheng Emperor subscribed to a relatively assimilationist approach to identity and ethnicity and more or less allowed cultural erosion in the Banners while supporting efforts at colonial expansion in southwest China and Taiwan, he nevertheless continued some of the multifaceted imperial expression associated more strongly with his predecessor and his successor. The depiction of him in a variety of different outfits, even if skewing towards Han elites (at least three of the fourteen portraits show him as a Chinese scholar), is a particularly striking, but also quite private expression of that sort of self-image. Another is that the Yongzheng Emperor was never formally designated the heir apparent, leaving his succession to the throne open to some degree of question. Association with the great monarchs of France may, like the use of Western-style cartography and portraiture by other emperors, have been seen as an alternative, external language of power that could bolster legitimacy to some extent. Or, perhaps, there is the rather strange fact that a Kangxi-era woodblock album, <em>Fifty-Three Transformation Bodies of Guanyin</em>, rather inexplicably included an image of a European aristocrat, reminiscent of Louis XIII, as a depiction of one of the aspects of the boddhisatva Avalokitasvara, giving the Bourbon-inspired garb another roundabout religious significance of its own.</p>

<p>This was not the only portrait the emperor had made of himself in imitation French garb, as there is also a portrait bust of him in similar though differently-coloured wig and clothing, though I thought the more animated portrait was more interesting. I basically concur with Sun Jing’s argument that these portraits were an attempt to satiate a personal curiosity about Europeans, trying to create a ‘view from within’ by having himself placed in the position of one of them, as well as demonstrating the legitimacy of the ‘universal empire’ by having him portray figures from both within and beyond its borders.</p>

<p>Most of the above is sourced from Sun Jing’s chapter in Thijs Weststeijn (ed.), <em>Foreign Devils and Philosophers: Cultural Encounters between the Chinese, the Dutch, and Other Europeans, 1590-1800</em>.</p>

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>That said, it’s interesting that none of these three manga would have focussed on anyone post Gen 3, and I’m wondering if it’s because they started production just <em>that</em> long ago or if there’s some kind of cutoff between debut and when Holomems could appear in certain HoloAlt projects.</p>

<p>—– <strong>413.1</strong> —–2022-05-14 00:54:44+08:00:</p>

<p>Well then. Just when you thought VTuber drama this year had peaked with Hololive firing one of their top talents, A-Soul, the biggest Chinese VTuber group, is imploding. I first caught wind of it this morning when a friend linked me to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/uluh3w/weekly_discussion_thread_may_9th_2022/i8dtf0w/">this thread</a> on the VirtualYoutubers sub, and now there’s a <a href="https://www.superpixel.com/article/73084/top-vtuber-china-only-paid-10-cents-per-20-subscription">brief article up</a> on Superpixel, an English-language news site for Chinese gaming industry news.</p>

<p>I’d recommend reading both of the above (though not for those of the faint of heart), but in short, the allegations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Members being forced to continue performing despite on-set injuries caused by poor studio equipment;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Long working hours leading to potentially permanent health implications i.e. hearing loss and vocal chord damage;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General abusive behaviour by agency management and studio staff;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the bit that was confirmed: they’re being paid a pittance. The talents’ salaries are well below the average wage for their part of China, and worse still, they’re only getting <em>0.5%</em> of the money from donations and subscriptions – Bilibili, their streaming platform, takes a 50% cut, and the agency takes 99% of the remainder. Contrast with Hololive where the exact breakdown isn’t known for sure, but where Youtube takes 30% and the rest is split around 50-50 between agency and talent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In essence this is, uh, kinda big news, at least if you’re in the Sinophone VTuber space. Which I’ll admit I’m mostly not, but I’d come across A-Soul via a small Youtuber who does a lot of meta-commentary videos about VTubers so they’d always been somewhat on my radar.</p>

<p>—– <strong>413.2</strong> —–2022-05-14 15:37:38+08:00:</p>

<p>You say turning corporate, but corporate VTubers have been around longer than indies if we start from Kizuna AI, who was literally conceived as a corporate product decoupled from the talent behind her. Indies followed very soon after, but the major agency players like Activ8 (Kizuna AI, upd8), Cover (Hololive), Ichikara/Anycolor (Nijisanji, VirtuaReal), and Unlimited/Brave Group (Game-Bu, Riot Music) all cut their teeth during the initial wave in 2017-18.</p>

<p>—– <strong>413.3</strong> —–2022-05-14 19:22:12+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s fascinating how they thought they could get away with just releasing the pay info – something that proved things were <em>worse</em> than thought – while categorically denying the rest.</p>
