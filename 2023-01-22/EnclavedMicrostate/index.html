<p>So, I have got to ask this, although I admit, it isn’t about the IS-2, at least not directly.</p>

<p>The KV-2. The terrifying, top-heavy-looking monstrosity that is the KV-2. Whose idea was it, why did nobody at any point say ‘let’s not’, and was it any good? Or, if you prefer a more IS-2-based question, what sorts of design lessons did the KV-2 provide? What worked well, what needed correcting?</p>

<p>For a general survey, William T. Rowe’s <em>China’s Last Empire: The Great Qing</em> is a very good synthesis of the scholarship on the pre-1800 period, albeit with a general geographic bias towards the Yangtze valley and China proper more broadly, over the full scope of the Qing empire.</p>

<p>Peter Perdue’s <em>China Marches West</em> is the book to read on the expansion of Qing rule into Inner Eurasia, although it mainly covers the conquest more than governance. For that, see James Millward’s <em>Beyond the Pass</em> on Xinjiang, Max Oidtmann’s <em>Forging The Golden Urn</em> on Tibet, and/or Johan Elverskog’s <em>Our Great Qing</em> on Mongolia. Matthew Mosca’s <em>From Frontier Policy to Foreign Policy</em> also gets into the matter of Qing understandings of India, which may also be of interest. Looking at a different domain of expansion, Ronald Po’s <em>The Blue Frontier</em> is a good revisionist history of Qing maritime policy.</p>

<p>For a dive into the politics of China Proper, books on controversies seem to be the big ones for getting a glimpse into the inner workings of the state, so have a look at <em>Treason by the Book</em> by Jonathan Spence, which narrates the 1727 Zeng Jing affair, and especially at Philip Kuhn’s <em>Soulstealers</em>, which uses the 1767 queue-cutting panic as a window into the structures of Qing governance. While a little older, James Polachek’s <em>The Inner Opium War</em> is a fascinating little deep-dive into Qing high politics from the end of the Qianlong reign to the early Xianfeng reign. A more focussed study looking specifically at the Jiaqing reign is Wensheng Wang’s <em>White Lotus Rebels and South China Pirates</em>, which attempts to contextualise his reforms in terms of rational responses to real deficiencies, rather than as a sign of ‘dynastic decline’ as Kuhn had framed it. R. Kent Guy’s <em>Qing Governors and Their Provinces</em> is one I have but have not read, but it covers both a wide span of space and time and may be a good single-book choice.</p>

<p>It’s worth also considering the Qing’s more colonial frontiers: Emma Teng’s <em>Taiwan’s Imagined Geography</em>, John Robert Shepard’s <em>Statecraft and Political Economy on the Taiwan Frontier, 1600-1800</em>, and Laura Hostetler’s <em>Qing Colonial Enterprise</em> are all extremely valuable reads on Qing relations with indigenous peoples. The second and third chapters of Norman Smith’s edited volume <em>Empire and Environment in the Making of Manchuria</em> are also worth reading for an understanding of the colonial dynamics of Qing rule in that region, and see also Jonathan Schlesinger’s <em>A World Trimmed With Fur</em> on the broader interaction between ecology, economy, and colonialism on the Qing periphery.</p>

<p>It would be remiss not to include some key cornerstones of ‘New Qing’ historiography as well. The two big ones would be Pamela Crossley’s <em>A Translucent Mirror</em>, about Qianlong-era ideological developments, and Mark Elliott’s <em>The Manchu Way</em>, about the development of the Banner system up to about 1800. There’s also a couple of edited volumes worth looking at: Lynn Struve’s <em>The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time</em> and Millward, Dunnell, Elliott and Forêt’s <em>New Qing Imperial History</em>.</p>

<p>We don’t know precisely why she was fired. The termination notice simply stated that she was fired for ‘breach of contract’ and for spreading rumours, not specifically NDA violations, and Korekore (‘Japanese Keemstar’) insinuated that she had been leaking other info to him in the past. So it could be that her leaks – deliberate or otherwise – in February-March 2022 were the sole cause, or it could be that she had been let off with a warning before and was fired over a repeat offence. We simply do not know the precise reasons, but it’s certainly not due to any company policy around a ‘dating ban’ as some have insinuated (indeed there’s at least one talent at that particular agency who’s been very open about her relationships, and two who are public about having been dating).</p>

<p>Not all VTubers are owned or managed by the same agency, or even under an agency at all. There are 20,000 VTubers in the world as of last November <a href="https://www.userlocal.jp/press/20221129vt/">according to data firm UserLocal</a>, and the two biggest agencies by popularity – Hololive and Nijisanji – account for fewer than 300 (75 from Hololive, 222 from Nijisanji). There are a <em>lot</em> of agencies, but most of them are small, with Hololive and Nijisanji being extreme outliers in terms of both roster and audience size: most agencies will be lucky to pull in 1 million total subscriptions across a dozen or so talents.</p>

<p>Most VTubers, however, are independents: some bigger, some smaller. At one end you have someone like Spanish-speaking VTuber Nimu Spacecat with 2.4m Twitch followers (the most-followed VTuber on Twitch), at the other you have a whole host of really small indies (I wouldn’t even know where to look, but search ‘debut’ on the VirtualYoutubers subreddit and you’ll find a few), with various people in the middle like Nekomiya Hinata or OBKatieKat. It’s a very big space, where the major agencies are really just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Well then. It has happened. As of yesterday (25 January 2023 when I’m writing this), EN VTuber agency Tsunderia has dissolved, with its members continuing as independents. This isn’t necessarily a shocking blow, but it comes at the tail end of a long period of downsizing for the agency since April 2022, when five of its then-twelve members, including Miori Celesta (far and away its most popular member), departed as independents. (The other four were Yazaki Kallin, Matsuro Meru, Nini Yuuna and Orla Gan Ceann). <em>Except</em> this wasn’t wholly the case – in Kallin’s case at least, she was <a href="https://twitter.com/kallinGBN/status/1602806686728732675">loaning her character IP from Tsunderia</a> until she could rebrand, which may also have been true of Orla, who hasn’t been active in some months, possibly for the same reason. Nini Yuuna and Miori Celesta were independents before Tsunderia so continued independent; Matsuro Meru has continued streaming and not promised a rebrand so it’s unclear what’s going on with her.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, when combined with departures of its early members in 2021, after the April 2022 departures all of Generation 1 were gone and the only remaining member of ‘Generation 0’ was Inukai Purin, who <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunderia_us/status/1617341472914677763">announced her departure on 22 January</a>, leading to – or perhaps pre-empting – <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunderia_us/status/1618443736622501888">the announcement of the agency’s closure yesterday.</a></p>

<p>So what does this all mean? Very little.</p>

<p>If we zoom out a bit, at one stage Tsunderia was one of five notable mid-sized EN agencies, alongside Cyberlive, Phase-Connect, PRISM Project, and Production Kawaii. These were agencies with around 20k mean subscribers per talent, and between half a dozen and a dozen talents, which is decently respectable all told in a relatively saturated market. (That said, Tsunderia’s apparent size was inflated heavily by the presence of Miori, whose 217k subscribers represented two-thirds of the agency’s combined subs.) Ironically, after a series of featurettes written on these five agencies on the VirtualYoutubers subreddit in February 2022, the troubles began. Tsunderia’s I’ve mentioned, but Cyberlive also had its fair share of issues: in March, two of its nine members transferred to Phase-Connect; in May, issues with some of its staff failing to meet commitments led to the agency reorganising into an indie network, Aetheria; in October, misconduct accusations against the agency’s main manager led to Aetheria dissolving outright. With that, the EN mid-tier has been reduced to three agencies, and interestingly, the two that have shuttered are both US-based, while of the remainder, two are headquartered in Japan and one is based in Canada.</p>

<p>Except Tsunderia’s shrinkage has coincided with the emergence and growth of other agencies. Phase-Connect, PRISM Project, and Production Kawaii are all doing well for themselves*, and there are now a number of potential emerging players albeit with smaller numbers at present: Israel-based Idol Corp, Singapore-based VReverie, and Taiwan-based Akio Air. So it’s not like there aren’t small EN agencies emerging to fill the gap. It just remains to be seen which ones can establish themselves, and which ones end up quietly going the same way.</p>

<p>* There may be some caveats to that though. Production Kawaii has been accused on occasion of inept management, while Phase-Connect is riding heavily on the success of Pipkin Pippa, who is basically 4chan personified. So there are reasons to also ‘hrmmm’ a bit there.</p>

<p>To be fair I also mostly only know of her by reputation, but I’ve watched one or two of her edited videos, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zukpiSTr5M">this one</a>, and I certainly see where the narrative comes from.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, another second-hand report from me, coming via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/10llml5/a_progress_report_on_where_the_small_en_agencies/j5xvm0x/">this</a>. Unfortunately they don’t list sources, but at the very least I can find some evidence WRT the copyright strike claim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOiI4TTUgbA</p>
