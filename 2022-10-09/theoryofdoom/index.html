<p>This is all a tragedy and it is unconscionable.   Russia is in a very difficult situation with Armenia because if they start pouring munitions into that country, the United States State Department will do the same with Azerbaijan.  For this reason, Moscow correctly understands that they would only be pouring gas on the fire.</p>

<p>The only way this stops is when Azerbaijan and Turkey pay an unacceptably high price for their past war crimes and crimes against humanity.  I am out of step with the State Department on this and I have no reservations whatsoever about saying it.</p>

<p>What Azerbaijan and Turkey are doing is egregious.  It is intolerable in any civilized world.  And it must be stopped.</p>

<p>I have to say, though.  I <em>can</em> cook excellent vegan food, I just don’t <em>enjoy</em> doing it.  For example, I can make stuffed eggplant with spinach, tomato and garlic that people tend to rave over.  I do not like eggplant, but those who do tell me it’s good.</p>

<p>However.  No matter how flavorful I can make it, I will never enjoy cooking tofu and I refuse to cook meat replacements.  If you want meat, I will cook meat.  If you do not want meat, then don’t pretend to eat meat.</p>

<p>—– <strong>406.1</strong> —–2022-10-07 22:01:17+08:00:</p>

<p>I don’t think we’re ever going to solve gun violence in the United States.  I’m not even sure there is a “solution,” because the issues underlying “gun” violence are too politically charged for any solution to be reachable.  We do not speak candidly about “gun” violence in this country, either.  Instead, there’s just a lot of vitriolic sound and fury after each high profile incident of so-called “gun violence.”  One side says ban the guns.  Another side opposes.  The NRA was once a really powerful force in American politics, too.  But not so much anymore.</p>

<p>The ease of passing laws with respect to the instrumentalities of gun violence — i.e., guns — is the beginning and end of why those laws get passed.  Efforts to ban, regulate and limit the sales, distribution or functionality of firearms will never reduce gun violence.  Passing laws to that effect make it seem like politicians are doing something useful.  But the problem is the difference between what they say they <em>intend</em> such laws to do, and what such laws <em>actually</em> accomplish or do not accomplish.</p>

<p>My father and grandfather were both in the United States military.  I was taught how to shoot from a very young age.  Guns do not scare me at all, because I understand them and know how to use them.  Most people do not, however.  Most people, if they saw an AK-47 or AR-style rifle would be terrified of a so-called “assault” rifle.  But anyone who has ever fired an automatic weapon like that knows that semi-automatic rifles are far more dangerous than fully automatic ones.  Fully automatic rifles are good for laying down covering/suppressing fire, and little more.</p>

<p>Magazine/clip capacity limits are also stupid.  Same with barrel length restrictions on certain weapons, like shotguns.  A shotgun barrel below a certain length is almost wholly useless because of how wide the spread of the shot expands over very short distances.  Defeats the purpose of even having a shotgun, when it has no stopping power at even 10 meters.  Same with accessory limitations, like bans on threaded barrels or suppressors.  For example, a “suppressor” does not make a gun silent.  It’s still very loud and can be heard from quite some distance, even if you’re using subsonic ammunition.</p>

<p>Background checks might make sense.  But they’re not very effective.  They fail to prevent a lot of people from getting guns who go on to commit acts of violence and criminality.  And they prevent law abiding citizens from purchasing/owning/transferring firearms often for no good reason at all.  In essentially every way, background checks as we both currently do them and have the capability to do them (including with AI-based checks) are a false sense of security.</p>

<p>The way to deal with gun violence is to deal with the underlying causes of violent crime, in the first instance.  The focus should not be on the instrumentality, but the underlying psychology of why people commit violent crime to begin with.  And it’s not obvious that can be accomplished through policy.</p>

Why Did They Get It So Wrong?</a>, submitted on 2022-10-07 10:45:40+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>410.1</strong> —–2022-10-07 10:49:13+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There was no reporting on the corruption in the Russian system,” said the former senior intelligence official. “They missed it, and ignored any evidence of it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You miss 100% of what you can’t see.  And the United States couldn’t see much of anything, because on an overreliance on sigint at the expense of actual targeting by actual operatives in denied areas.</p>

<p>—– <strong>410.2</strong> —–2022-10-09 23:44:08+08:00:</p>

<p>The basic premise of the article is that the CIA’s analysis of Putin’s odds of success were wildly off, which amounts to an inexplicable intelligence failure.</p>

<p>The problem is that this article is evaluating an assessment of what would have happened in Ukraine upon Putin’s invasion, without American and other external intervention in Ukraine itself.  It turns out that Putin would have conquered Ukraine very quickly, had the United States not provided the material, tactical and intelligence support it has. Here’s a quick example/explanation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Russian army’s points of greatest vulnerability are in the logistics of its operations.  Fuel trucks are one case of that particular category of vulnerabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Targeting fuel trucks was a force magnifier, which allowed Ukraine’s “army” to punch well above its weight.  If you stop fuel trucks, then you stop tanks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russian tanks have about a 45-65 km range, and if they can’t be refueled they are functionally useless, as the images of abandoned, destroyed and empty tanks littered throughout Ukraine readily demonstrate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea to target fuel trucks was not Ukraine’s.  They were provided with both the strategy (to target fuel trucks) and the actual targets (the actual inbound fuel trucks) in real time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had Ukraine not been provided with both the strategy and real time targets, those fuel trucks would have resupplied Russian tanks and they would have kept advancing in and throughout Ukraine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis the Intercept is referring to, and criticizing, was a scenario in which Ukraine lacked any such support.</p>

<p>But I’d also note that the quality of assessments is not exactly what it could be.  Starting in the 1990s and continuing through the present, the United States’ ground capabilities in denied areas, or formerly denied areas (such as the territory that is now the Russian Federation) is acutely limited.</p>

<p>This is as a result of many decisions to rely on information sources that are not humint to an unreasonably significant degree.  So, instead of having people inside and in proximity to the Kremlin, the United States largely relies on other information sources (e.g., sigint).  This is why the United States struggles to understand what is going on inside Russia and at the highest levels of Russia’s political leadership.</p>

<p>/r/worldnews is moderated by a group who consistently use their position to push their own agenda or the narratives that Reddit desires to promulgate.  That a person has shown a passt propensity to do so is often the deciding factor in whether they are even invited to moderate.</p>

<p>Many of the moderators on /r/worldnews and other such subs also moderate other subs as well, where they do the same thing. In this way, Reddit functions in much the same way as Twitter to create an illusory “consensus reality,” enforced by banning or removing any and all who state anything else.</p>

<p>It’s not so much a “hive mind” as a cultivated information ecosystem.</p>

<p>—– <strong>411.2</strong> —–2022-10-08 14:07:47+08:00:</p>
