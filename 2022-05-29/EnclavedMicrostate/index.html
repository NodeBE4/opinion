<p>It’s not <em>un</em>common by any means, though. The study of Chinese history has always had a bit of an identity crisis between being a field of history and a subfield of Chinese cultural studies and it’s only relatively recently that there’s been a strong pivot to the former.</p>

<p>This is interesting; HoloJP’s generally presumed to have had a 30-35-35 split between Youtube, Cover, and the talent, so Moona saying hers was 30-50-20 seems to be quite a big shift, unless she got the maths wrong since it contradicts what she says earlier in the clip.</p>

<p>Ah, t’would make sense then.</p>

<p>This is very much parroting others’ takes from other spaces I’m in, but the impression I get is that South Korea has a strong <em>audience</em> for VTubers but serious problems producing local talents.</p>

<p>—– <strong>459.4</strong> —–2022-05-26 15:15:42+08:00:</p>

<p>I probably should have been a little more precise in my language, although to be fair Isegye (whom I have heard of and know are successful) slipped my mind as well. More precisely, I meant to say that it seems like there’s a certain difficulty (especially for an overseas-based agency) to maintain a substantial group of KR VTubers of sort of middling size (i.e. not full-time job level).</p>

<p>—– <strong>459.5</strong> —–2022-05-28 12:03:01+08:00:</p>

<p>So, there are two things I’d bring up here.</p>

<p>Firstly, are they saying HoloEN needs more people because <em>they</em> want more HoloEN, or because it would benefit Holo as an agency?</p>

<p>Secondly, even if the former were true… so what? There are legitimately things that may make HoloEN stand out for someone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Collab potential with other talents one is already a fan of.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong music element in the agency writ large: One might understandably want a new music-focussed VTuber debut with HoloEN, a) because Cover has a more obvious track record of backing music-specific content, and b) because of potential collaborations with Calli, IRyS, or Suisei among others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A general ‘vibe’ of content style: some prefer Niji or indie talents because they seem less self-censoring, but this may well go in the other direction for those who don’t get as much of a kick out of people swearing like a sailor on stream (KFP employees excepted).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A stronger community on familiar platforms: this applies more to why people may not be drawn to Niji as opposed to indies given how active this sub is, but simply, if your main social media platform is Reddit then new Hololive debuts are actively community-building on a familiar platform; new debuts elsewhere, if the primary community space is something like Twitter or an oldschool forum or whatever site the young’uns are on now, require you to familiarise yourself with both a platform <em>and</em> a community.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>—– <strong>459.6</strong> —–2022-05-28 13:43:10+08:00:</p>

<p>I don’t know if we’re talking past each other here, but the points I bring up weren’t statements of objective fact, they were possible reasons for why any given person who does want more HoloEN might do so. You’ve raised a lot of nuances, but not necessarily logical flaws:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I think there <em>are</em> people who would be interested in what some otherwise-unknown person would bring to the table. Especially as HoloEN so far hasn’t recruited <em>that</em> many people prominent as VTubers (which I phrase that way to distinguish from prominent creators who dabbled in VTubing but weren’t primarily known for being so).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a twofold thing: for one, Holo’s relatively high production values means even getting as little as 20% of that is still a lot; for another, I should have been more specific that it also ties into the previous point – it’s not just about collabing with <em>any</em> music talent, but with <em>specific</em> ones that the viewer is already following.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agreed here in ‘objective’ terms as I don’t think the notion of the agencies having different content standards really does hold up to close scrutiny. But there’s a <em>perception</em> of such which influences behaviour.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that you’ve come off as gatekeeping fandom here – that people who want more HoloEN are being fans the <em>wrong</em> way, as opposed to simply differently.</p>

<p>To be fair, with NoeFure the two of them did also admit that the way they portrayed themselves on-stream wasn’t really authentic to how they interacted offline. Plus, one can very easily imagine that if they are serious – which I’m inclined to believe they are – then it’s not unreasonable that at some stage they might like to keep their relationship as something mostly between themselves. So while the fan obsession I think undoubtedly accelerated things, they would have gone more private about it sooner or later.</p>

<p>But that’s not an effective defence, on multiple levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you define a historian as anyone who ‘does history’, i.e. produces some form of consumable media presenting a narrative about the past, then Dan Carlin is by definition a historian and his assertions to the contrary are wrong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not he fits some abstract definition of ‘historian’, in producing consumable media presenting a narrative about the past, Carlin <em>ought</em> to have a responsibility to ensure that that narrative is as true as possible, based on the best information and analysis that is accessible to him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is already an understanding that Carlin’s content is, from a historical perspective, sub-par, then why recommend him? Well-communicated misinformation is still misinformation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine if were to I go around performing surgeries while insisting I’m not a surgeon, and when someone bleeds out on the operating table I were to say ‘I did say I wasn’t a surgeon!’, and when people complain about it other people go around defending me saying I’m not a surgeon, while also asserting that I should be allowed to perform surgery anyway.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the same way I may have misread you, you have almost certainly misread them: The problem isn’t that Carlin hasn’t spent 20 years researching the topics, it’s that he <em>hasn’t read anything by those who have</em>. He either parrots old narratives or even (which was apparently the case for his Caesar vs William the Conqueror episode) makes shit up.</p>

<p>—– <strong>470.1</strong> —–2022-05-27 13:35:04+08:00:</p>

<p>We tend to approach the period of around 1700 to 1815 as one of unchanging linear warfare, but this impression is wrong. Now, there are answers on this subreddit that go into the tactical and operational changes that took place from the French Revolution onward, such as these by /u/dandan_noodles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ca4vwo/how_common_where_smaller_skirmishes_during_the/</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9xgmlt/firing_lines/</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So I will specifically address things that went on between around 1700 and 1790. I’m not a specialist in this period but I’ve read up on it in the past (although I appreciate that some of this scholarship is older and may have been superceded), so I will own up to any errors or omissions that are pointed out.</p>

<h3 id="technological-developments">Technological Developments</h3>

<p>A focus purely on standard-issue infantry small arms obscures some rather noticeable technological developments, particularly in the field of artillery. One of the more noted developments of the period was the Gribeauval system introduced in 1765, which saw the French field artillery standardised to four calibres, and which also involved the guns being produced through machining by drilling out the bore rather than being cast with a void using a disposable clay core, allowing for more precise manufacture and a lighter end product. But Gribeauval was not the first artillery standardiser, merely one of the more comprehensive as well as being the first to introduce bore-drilling. Within France he was already building off standardisation attempts made by Vallière in the 1730s, while Austria saw its own attempt at artillery standardisation with the Liechtenstein system in the 1750s. These standardisations did not simply incrementally alter the efficiency of artillery, but also saw a move towards generally lighter calibres that were more suited to the conditions of field battles, which demanded greater mobility and higher, sustained rates of fire. You could carry more ammo for guns of smaller calibre, and lighter guns in general were easier to move.</p>

<p>In addition, the solid shot-firing field cannon was not the only gun type in use, as the former half of the eighteenth century also saw the rise of the explosive shell-firing howitzer. This had been introduced by the Dutch as a siege weapon in the 1690s, but its viability as a battlefield weapon soon became apparent. Because they fired explosive shells in a relatively high arc, howitzers essentially allowed for indirect fire, and so threatened troops in built-up areas or field fortifications who were otherwise well-protected from direct fire guns, diminishing the effectiveness of holding such strongpoints. But howitzers also derived their field potential from their usefulness as a platform for firing canister, a short-range anti-personnel munition consisting essentially of musket rounds that would end up being dispersed across a wide area. The wide bore and short barrel of the howitzer meant that it fired an especially large number of rounds across an especially wide dispersion. This latter role was so substantial that one particularly enterprising Russian ordnance master, Pyotr Shuvalov, developed a gun which he called the ‘secret howitzer’ designed as a canister-only platform, using a rather creative oval bore shape in an attempt to improve the horizontal dispersion of canister shot. It wasn’t very good (nor were his attempts at light field mortars), although another of Shuvalov’s introductions, the ‘unicorn’, paved the way for future developments (once its kinks were ironed out). Able to fire solid shot, shells, and canister, the unicorn was versatile enough that the basic pattern remained in service through the Crimean War in the 1850s.</p>

<p>It’s not for nothing that the mid-18th century has been said by some to have seen an ‘artillery revolution’. While some reformers (Gribeauval and Liechtenstein) were more successful than others (Shuvalov), they all represent armies attempting to refine their artillery arms considerably. Indeed, they were also trying to expand them. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14), armies brought an average of around one gun per 1000 men; by the time of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48) it was usually two or more; by the Seven Years’ War (1754/6-63) they brought at least three and typically five or more. Even if the infantry were still firing at each other in line with flintlocks, they were being hammered by five times more artillery in the middle of the period compared to the start.</p>

<p>While field artillery was the big beneficiary of technological improvement, it would be remiss not to also bring up the arrival of a specialist weapon in the infantry arm, that being the Jäger rifle. The pop culture image of the American War of <del>Tax Avoidance</del> Independence is that of British musketeers in line fighting American riflemen in loose order, but the British also fielded riflemen of their own, from two sources. The first were the Jäger of Britain’s Hessian allies, and the second were riflemen within the British army’s own light infantry elements, equipped with the Pattern 1776 Rifle patterned after German designs. The long rifles used by the American rebels were, to be frank, not battlefield weapons: to make effective use of the rifling you had to minimise ‘windage’ (the gap between the bullet and the bore of the weapon) and so the bullet and its patch were an intentionally tight fit that took a long time to force down. A well-trained musketeer could fire and reload two, three, or even four times in the time it took to reload a long rifle. The Jäger rifle, developed in the German states, essentially compromised by having a short barrel that was much faster to ram a patch and ball down, while still having a considerable advantage in accuracy over a smoothbore musket. It would also become the pattern for the later Baker Rifle of the Napoleonic Wars issued to specialist light troops in the British army, the King’s German Legion, and the Portuguese army. (And, of course, Jäger rifles remained in use among the armies of the German states.)</p>

<h3 id="organisational-innovations">Organisational Innovations</h3>

<p>I have alluded above to this already, but it simply cannot be understated how substantial the shift in the very ethos of military tactics was in the latter half of the eighteenth century. The (re?)emergence of light troops in European warfare, while often considered a feature of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars or as a reaction to American tactics in the 1770s, in fact had its origins early in the century, with a major contributor being experience from the Habsburg monarchy’s wars against the Ottomans in the Balkans, although one could argue that similar shifts in North America were driven specifically by adaptation to Native American tactics. The Balkan campaigns saw the Habsburg armies make considerable use of light infantry, of whom the most notable were the Croatian Grenzer, and of light cavalry, most prominently the Hungarian Hussars. In turn, these saw emulation to greater or lesser extents in European armies, some of which shared the Habsburgs’ approach of recruiting from certain cultural groups perceived as more experienced (or, in proto-racial terms, better suited) to such forms of warfare. On the one hand there were ad hoc formations built around the idea of ‘partisan warfare’: Grassin’s Legion, a unit of 600 light infantry and 300 light cavalry, served through the War of the Austrian Succession and did end up seeing fighting – in skirmish order – at the Battle of Fontenoy; during the Seven Years’ War, the Prussians made extensive use of <em>Freikorps</em> formations to carry out a ‘small war’ of raiding and harassment against their French, Austrian, and Russian adversaries; the British in North America assembled their own comparable forces, most prominently Rogers’ Rangers. But there were also more established light forces as well: Prussia assembled its own regular forces of Jäger and Hussars; the British army arguably began using light troops when it assembled its first Highland regiments between 1710 and 1739 (though such forces came to be more ‘standard’ line troops in time), but it firmly established permanent bodies of these in 1770, when each battalion was required to designate one of its ten companies as light infantry.</p>

<p>Light troops performed two principal roles: supporting the army on campaign, and serving as a more flexible, though less decisive, arm in battle. On campaign, ‘partisan’ forces attached to armies would conduct reconnaissance, procure supplies if needed, and harass enemy troops and logistics if the opportunity presented itself, as well as attempting to prevent the enemy’s light troops doing the same. In battle, light infantry generally lacked the ability to perform decisive shock action, but the approach of individually aimed fire conducted in loose order gave them substantial ‘staying power’ so to speak, as they peppered enemy troops with fire while limiting the casualties they themselves took, allowing engagements to stretch out. Light cavalry were not perceived as having the same level of shock potential as heavier cavalry, but they could still launch a decent assault on a vulnerable position in the enemy’s formations, or run down and scatter a demoralised force.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>In short, I simply cannot agree with the premise of the question. The period described – even if we cut out the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars – can be argued to have seen two major shifts take place: one in artillery, primarily up to the 1760s, and one in the use of light troops, primarily from the 1740s onwards, both of which saw a considerable increase in quantity and refinement in quality and usage.</p>

<p>—– <strong>470.2</strong> —–2022-05-27 14:31:54+08:00:</p>

<p><em>Jäger</em> (hunter) was the standard term used for light infantry fielded by the German states. The term ‘Jäger rifle’ was thus used to refer to the rifles used by such troops, as opposed to professional hunters – although there’s no reason the latter could not have made use of them.</p>

<p>—– <strong>470.3</strong> —–2022-05-27 15:55:36+08:00:</p>

<p>I cannot speak for the linked posts especially as I broadly didn’t cover the periods in question in my answer, but for my own part I drew mostly on work by Christopher Duffy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Military Experience in the Age of Reason</em> (1987)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Fortress in the Age of Vauban and Frederick the Great 1660-1789</em> (1985)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Russia’s Military Way to the West: Origins and Nature of Russian Military Power 1700-1800</em> (1981)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Though on artillery I also made heavy use of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ken MacLennan, ‘Liechtenstein and Gribeauval: ‘Artillery Revolution’ in Political and Cultural Context’, <em>War in History</em> 10:3 (2003)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also find this article to be of interest on light infantry though I have my quibbles with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jack Owen, ‘The Influence of Warfare in Colonial America On the Development of British Light Infantry’, <em>Army History</em> 44 (1998)</li>
</ul>

<p>—– <strong>470.4</strong> —–2022-05-27 16:01:59+08:00:</p>

<p>I think he both overstates the influence that American warfare had on Anglo-French tactics considering the concurrent rise of light troops in the armies of the German states, and hews to a rather traditionalist narrative in which the British failed to properly adapt to American infantry tactics rather than their defeat being a primarily strategic and not a tactical failure.</p>

<p>There’s a limited accuracy insofar as yes, you can argue that during the early stages of the fighting the American colonists made heavier use of ‘pure’ light infantry than their counterparts in the regular British army. But the reality was that A: the British and their allies made considerable use of their own light troops, and professionally trained ones at that; and B: ultimately the Americans still established a conventional line force in the form of the Continental Army <em>and</em> gained an alliance with the French, who sent line troops of their own, before winning.</p>

<p>Hi there - we’re happy to approve your question related to your creative project, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists and the like, based on past experience: some people working on creative projects have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what’s needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it’s not always what you want to hear.</p>

<p>Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you’re asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don’t know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.</p>

<p>It’s me again, and you know what that means. VTuber drama relating to parts of the fandom I’m not active in outside meta discussion. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uq7vr6/hobby_scuffles_week_of_may_16_2022/i9bb731/">Last week</a> I talked about Nijisanji’s merchandise drama, this week we have fandom drama. As this concerns Luxiem you’ll need to read the linked comment to find out who they are if you don’t know already; if or when you do know, read on.</p>

<p>So, if Luxiem is NijiEN’s big breakout, Vox Akuma is the leader of the pack. His popularity isn’t a huge surprise as he’s got a good few things going for him: he’s part of the first group of English-speaking male talents from a major VTuber agency, and he has an appealing character design, a strong personality on stream, and a south-of-England accent. Unfortunately he seems to have also built up a rather problematic section of his fanbase and a recent incident has led to at least some viewers wanting him to rein them in.</p>

<p>Vox recently did a ‘boyfriend ASMR’ stream in which at one stage he received a DM from a fellow (female) NijiEN talent, Reimu Endo. This was apparently a cardinal sin on Reimu’s part, who was almost immediately harassed on basically every corner of the internet by the more obsessive Vox fans for interrupting his stream. This has led to Reimu cancelling several planned streams in order to take a break. While several other members of NijiEN have at least publicly tweeted to offer support, Vox (as of writing) has not. Moreover, he’s scheduled <em>another</em> ‘boyfriend ASMR’ stream which seems like an especially tone-deaf decision. From the discussion that’s emerged, it seems like there’s been some bubbling discontent over apparently a consistent pattern of Vox not making some attempt to rein in his fans, unlike several of his colleagues, and that this incident is sort of the final straw which pushed several viewers over the line towards stating it openly.</p>

<p>As for my take, I don’t really have one. While I agree with the basic premise that Vox ought to take more responsibility for what his fans get up to if he isn’t telling them off, the more extreme assertion – that he’s deliberately cultivating a toxic fanbase for monetary gain – seems overly cynical for my tastes. Moreover, there are shades of what was often asserted when Hololive’s Rushia got in hot water in the roughly two-week gap between the Discord leak on 11 February and her firing: that Rushia’s leaning on ‘GFE’ (girlfriend experience) content had been her own doing and that she was facing the consequences, which is pretty overt victim-blaming. Now in this case accusing Vox of not controlling his fanbase isn’t quite the same as he’s not the one under attack, but it’s still a troubling line of argument.</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.2</strong> —–2022-05-30 17:37:44+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s a twofold thing for me of:</p>

<p>A: It’s skipping a step – arguably it’s possible to do such content responsibly with some kind of clear set of disclaimers or communicated boundaries. At some stage there is a point where the content creator stops being directly responsible for fan behaviour, and for me that’s when they formally set some kind of boundary, because transgressing that then becomes on the viewer.</p>

<p>B: Even without that (and this I think is my more controversial take), it implies that at some stage the extremes of viewers’ parasocial tendencies are the fault of the content creator, and I would argue that at worst there is a certain mutual responsibility. There is, I will admit, a very blurred line when it comes to exploiting and encouraging parasocial behaviour – also two things in my view – but for me at least it’s hard to hold the creator responsible for unspoken assumptions made by their audience. Maybe this is all very death-of-the-author, but once the content is out there, people experiencing it will end up with their own takes.</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.3</strong> —–2022-05-30 19:11:19+08:00:</p>

<p>Sure, I think your take is a perfectly valid one. And indeed /u/adaarable’s too. We’re coming at this from quite distinct first principles about the relationship between creators and audience, and that is leading us to quite evidently irreconcilable conclusions.</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.4</strong> —–2022-05-31 11:12:36+08:00:</p>

<p>Update to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v0cylk/hobby_scuffles_week_of_may_30_2022/iairldp/?context=3">the NijiEN drama</a> that I mentioned, gosh, less than 24 hours ago (but long enough ago that I thought the update warranted a new post):</p>

<p>Vox ‘apologised’ once and it went over <em>badly</em> to the point where it seems like a lot of the fence-sitters were pushed over the fence <em>against</em> him (you can find a transcript of his first statement, in which he, uh, cast a portion of the blame <em>at Reimu</em> <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1531360212153733121.html">here</a>):</p>

<p>But <em>then</em> he <em>actually</em> apologised, addressing the concerns, <em>retracting his blaming of Reimu</em> (god was that a dumb take), and committing to setting boundaries going forward, so hopefully (?) that marks not only the end of this drama but the beginning of the end of the impetus behind it.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone was not going to be fully convinced. I myself don’t want to be so cynical that I would consider him to have been pressured by management or by colleagues to essentially ‘redo’ the apology, but I do think it’s concerning that he stuck to his guns for as long as he did (that being, er, about 24 hours to be ‘fair’).</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.6</strong> —–2022-05-31 13:56:08+08:00:</p>

<p>Yeah 24 hours is definitely faster than some contrite turnarounds I’ve seen. But jumping to pulling your friend out from under the bus to throw them under an express train as your first reaction – before even making a statement on Twitter for instance – is still a horrendous look, however quickly you recognise your mistake and retract it. Still, I’m glad he did make an attempt in the end.</p>

<p>I dunno. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen this line of argument used for ASMR roleplay channels, not to say they don’t exist of course, I may well just have missed the discourse on it. Is there just something qualitatively different when a more variety-focussed content creator does it, or is it just that that’s also widely regarded as problematic and I just haven’t seen the critiques?</p>

<p>YES! I hoped someone would ask.</p>

<p>So, a not inconsiderable amount of VTuber drama relates to things being inadvertently revealed when VTubers tab out of something, though the severity of such leaks lie on a sliding scale. At one end you have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/v22wlx/towas_desktop_background_might_just_be_the_cutest/">Towa’s background being an adorable piece of fanart</a> depicting her and a now-retired friend from Nijisanji, at the other you have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/t7d6cz/nijien_discord_leak_megathread_discussion_thread/">the infamous NijiEN Discord leak</a>. Thankfully, the pirated male nipple teasing porn folder incident leans towards the former side of the scale.</p>

<p>This was 27 February 2022. Rushia’s termination from Hololive was barely half a week ago. The VTuber community was in mourning. And on this day, during a Valorant stream, Nijisanji JP’s Lauren Iroas accidentally tabbed out of the game, revealing his file explorer, where, in the sidebar, people noticed two oddly named folders: MIAA-452, and MSVD-469. Well, some enterprising sleuths ‘discovered’ (I mean to be honest, probably knew from experience) that torrented versions of JAV (Japanese Adult Video, i.e. porn) are placed in a folder whose name is the video’s product code, whereas legitimate copies would have the title. And because you can just find those product codes on JAV stores, that meant that people quickly figured out two things: a) that his porn was pirated; and b) what specifically he was into – both videos involved the same actress and also male nipple teasing.</p>

<p>Deets: https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/t3t3zx/lauren_iroas_exposed_his_cultured_fetish_on_stream/</p>

<p>Coming in the wake of one of the most divisive VTuber scandals in two and a half years, the Lauren pirating male nipple teasing porn incident was the moment of levity that everyone just sort of needed. To add playful insult to minor injury, after Lauren posted an apology on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/MatuMoto_arrows/status/1498189573490241541">the actress in question tweeted back at Lauren</a> suggesting that he should actually pay for his porn next time.</p>

<p>Lauren did then go on hiatus until 20 April, though the messaging may be a little ambiguous on whether he took a hiatus voluntarily, was suspended by the agency, or that the agency was already planning a suspension but he inadvertently pre-empted them. All agree though that it was a pretty funny set of events.</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.27</strong> —–2022-06-04 04:05:46+08:00:</p>

<p>Oh dear more VTuber drama (besides the human trafficking affair mentioned earlier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v0cylk/hobby_scuffles_week_of_may_30_2022/ib21d78/">here</a> by /u/xMasterSlave), one fan-side, one talent-side.</p>

<p>On the talent side, mid-sized English-language agency Production Kawaii has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/v3wugx/neena_makurano_has_been_terminated_from/">just fired second-generation member Neena Makurano</a> for a raft of contract violations, which per the official announcement involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaking confidential info and communications;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaking false information to fans over private social media channels; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Violating an exclusivity clause by operating a separate independent VTuber channel.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Per the discussions I’ve read, Neena was planning to depart the agency in August anyway at the conclusion of her contract, but the aforementioned violations led to her being fired outright instead. A stream by fellow Gen 2 member Namiji Freesia confirmed a number of details, including Neena’s having specifically redirected fans to her independent account, and lying about apparently being promoted at a different job and having less time to stream.</p>

<p>What I’m finding interesting is that the internal info that Nami and the official announcement by Kawaii have divulged shows some noticeable contrasts with what we know of other agencies. Firstly, Kawaii apparently requires a minimum of four streams of two hours each per week, which is noticeably higher than Hololive’s three hours total per week; secondly, Nami is not the first VTuber to be fired for violating a non-moonlighting clause, as WACTOR’s Shino Laila was also indefinitely suspended for maintaining a second VTuber channel. The difference in Laila’s case is that WACTOR’s announcement actually doxed the talent behind her, and also her contract wasn’t actually terminated and they ignored her attempts to terminate it from her end (which also happened to another member) and they’re being sued for it.</p>

<p>I find the anti-moonlighting side of things quite interesting, though that word may be a little too dispassionate. Kawaii’s minimums seem very high and would likely make it very difficult for anyone with them to transfer any audience over to an independent career outside the agency should they decide to leave. This may contrast with some of Kawaii’s current and former peers in the mid-tier of EN agencies, particularly Tsunderia and Cyberlive (the latter now reorganised as Aetheria), which have ended up downsizing heavily lately as the talents get to own their own character IPs and can simply cut ties with the agency while keeping their models and past content – which is what several members of both agencies have done. I don’t think it’s necessarily coincidence that Kawaii is based in Japan (where indies moving in and out of agencies is much rarer though not unknown – see Nijisanji’s Kuzuha or Hololive’s Suisei for instance) whereas Tsunderia and (former) Cyberlive are US-based. There hadn’t been a particularly strong ‘corporate’ presence in the formative period of EN VTubing and independent talent seems much more highly valued as a result, with one of the major implications being that an agency-affiliated VTuber can reasonably be expected to leave the agency but keep their character and following. The flipside is that agencies operate somewhat more ephemerally, and the potential pooling of resources towards major group projects (such as Kawaii’s upcoming 3D debuts) may not be as viable for an entity that is theoretically moments away from a major talent exodus at all times.</p>

<p>My reductionist take is that there are agencies that incentivise staying, and there are those that disincentivise leaving. The former <em>tend</em> to be Western-based agencies with a more indie mindset an the latter <em>tend</em> to be Japan-based agencies with a more corporate one.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the fan side, Hololive’s Kazama Iroha is getting a 3D debut and people are angry because IRyS isn’t.</p>

<p>I think I need to provide some context to the above. Officially, the talents working for Hololive Production are subdivided into four branches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hololive ‘proper’ (or Hololive Japan/HoloJP) for female talents who are primarily Japanese-speaking;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Holostars for male talents who are primarily Japanese-speaking;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hololive Indonesia (HoloID) for Bahasa Indonesia-fluent talents (exclusively female at present); and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hololive English (HoloEN) for primarily English-speaking talents (exclusively female at present).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All branches are superficially divided into ‘generations’, typically of five members in HoloJP and HoloEN, three in HoloID, and basically anything in Holostars, although this may not have much bearing on which members tend to collaborate, nor does it align particularly closely with the organisation of management. In effect, ‘generations’ simply mark a group of talents who debut in a particular designated timeframe, some of whom tend to be closer and some of whom may not be. So for instance Hololive 1st Generation debuted in June 2019 (except Yozora Mel who debuted in May but It’s Complicated and ask about it if you want clarification there), Hololive Indonesia 3rd Generation debuted in March this year, etc. All Japanese generations since Gen 3 have had an official generation name besides the number, with Gen 3 being Hololive Fantasy, Gen 4 being HoloForce, and Gen 5 originally being HoloFive before switching to NePoLaBo following Mano Aloe’s departure shortly after debut. HoloID’s generation names are largely unofficial, being Area 15, Holoro, and HoloH3roes respectively. Hololive English officially foregoes generation numbers in favour of names, with its two main groups being Myth (debuted September 2020) and Council (debuted August 2021).</p>

<p>Most Hololive talents mainly use Live2D models, which are essentially 2D models rigged up to be animatable through deliberate distortion and translation of elements and with motion capture input provided typically by a smartphone camera. However, at certain subscriber milestones, members also get 3D models which are full-body rigged, allowing full-body 3D if they have access either to the main studio in Japan or their own mocap suit at home, as well as a more limited format known as ‘Home3D’ which still uses phone inputs but just animates the shoulders-up area. Now, while there are theoretically minimum subscriber milestones for 3D, at this stage Hololive talents get enough of a boost from simply being in the agency that the requirements get met by default and it exists solely on paper. As of writing, the only member outside of HoloJP to have had an ‘official’ 3D debut is EN Myth’s Mori Calliope, who lives in Japan and had a free 3D concert in early April. However, all five members of EN Myth and all three of ID Gen 1 do have 3D models and these were used during a paid-access concert back in March, and all eight except for Myth’s Takanashi Kiara and Ninomae Ina’nis have used them for Home3D since. While I’m not clear on whether ID Gen 1 considers themselves as having officially made 3D debuts, within Myth only Calli considers herself to have done so.</p>

<p>Going back to the talents sort of involved, Kazama Iroha is part of Hololive 6th Generation, a.k.a. Secret Society HoloX (which is so far the only HoloJP generation to be consistently listed by its generation name rather than its number on official media), which debuted over the last week of November 2021, and she was the last of its five members to debut on 30 November. IRyS is somewhat unusual in that she’s Hololive’s only solo debut so far since 2019, and is specifically marked as a ‘VSinger’ rather than an ordinary VTuber. Moreover, the job requirements during auditions had included both English and Japanese fluency, which wouldn’t make her the first openly bilingual talent but would essentially be the first time someone had been specifically required to be. Auditions took place in December 2020-January 2021, and IRyS debuted on 11 July 2021 as the sole member of Hololive English Project:HOPE. The VSinger designation has never been very clearly defined, but IRyS has a considerably higher recorded music output than most other talents with the exception of fellow EN member Mori Calliope, while still streaming conventionally like other agency members. She is also known to be living in Japan and she’s met up with Calli IRL several times and has been in the main Hololive studio on occasion.</p>

<p>Most Hololive members since 2020 have received second costumes within less than a year, and most of HoloJP Gen 5 got their 3D debuts within a little over 6 months. We’re 7 months on from HoloX’s first debut, and Iroha has just been announced to be unveiling her 3D model on 10 June, although it’s safe to assume that the other members of HoloX will follow. You may see the issue already: IRyS has been around nearly twice as long as HoloX, and lives in Japan, but doesn’t have a 3D debut in sight. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but likely relate to both Myth (which predated her) not having all officially debuted their 3D models yet, and possibly her main illustrator being busier than expected, along with her original model being unusually elaborate by Hololive standards to begin with. Unfortunately she has also ostensibly been a little hard done by on the Live2D front. Both HoloX and the other ten members of HoloEN besides IRyS got kimono alt outfits for New Year’s 2022, but IRyS’ was apparently delayed. She also hasn’t had a non-event alt outfit yet, although to be fair neither have Council. As a result there’s a bit of a narrative that IRyS is being neglected by management and so unfortunately Iroha’s 3D announcement has been hijacked by angry fans and antis alike complaining about a lack of news about IRyS. The thread on the Hololive subreddit has had to be locked for that reason, so that’s unpleasant.</p>

<p>Yes, IRyS definitely has other things to be working on and is in any case a solo debut in a different branch from JP; the rhythms and scheduling there will necessarily be different. Above all she doesn’t deserve to be invoked as a bludgeon during other members’ big events.</p>
