       . By Rana Mitter. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 458 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25.

      An exploration of the lives of American soldiers returning from combat, many of them physically fit but psychologically wounded. An important and uncomfortable book by the Pulitzer-prize-winning author of “The Good Soldiers”.
           
      How Asia Works: Success and Failure in the World’s Most Dynamic Region
       . By Joe Studwell. Grove; 366 pages; $27. Profile; £14.99.

      China Goes Global: The Partial Power
       . By David Shambaugh. Oxford University Press; 409 pages; $29.95 and £20.
      China’s footprint is “broad, but not deep”, argues David Shambaugh of George Washington University, which means it is not nearly as powerful as people think. As one of the few recent books that says China is not going to take over the world, this work is a welcome antidote to some of the widespread hyperventilating about China’s rise. Scholarly, fascinating and controversial.
      
       
      Biography and memoir
      
           
      Coolidge
       . By Amity Shlaes. Harper; 560 pages; $35.

      Isaac and Isaiah: The Covert Punishment of a Cold War Heretic
       . By David Caute. Yale University Press; 336 pages; $35 and £25.
      What could have been a minor academic squabble is transformed here into a wide-ranging discussion of some of the major ideological disputes of the 20th century—Marxism, Zionism, liberalism and the significance of the Russian revolution. The author is a well-known British novelist, playwright and historian.

       . By Robert Hilburn. Little, Brown; 679 pages; $32. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; £20.

      Music at Midnight: The Life and Poetry of George Herbert
       . By John Drury. Allen Lane; 396 pages; £25.
      To be published in America in April by University of Chicago Press; $35 Being an English country minister has inspired many writers, none of them more lapidary, precise, witty and surprising than George Herbert, the frail intellectual who preached to the parish of Bemerton from 1630 to 1633. An account of an Anglican priest and his poetry that will probably never be bettered.
           
      Into Exile: A Life Story of War and Peace
       . By Elin Toona Gottschalk. Lakeshore Press; 370 pages; $29.

       . By Gary Bass. Knopf; 499 pages; $30.

       . By Doris Kearns Goodwin. Simon &amp; Schuster; 928 pages; $40. Viking; £20.

       . By Brendan Simms. Basic Books; 690 pages; $35. Allen Lane; £30.
      An original take on Europe’s history that shows that German power was a concern long before the country formally came into being in the late 19th century, and perhaps as far back as the mid-1400s. A compelling and provocative thesis that has lessons for politicians today.

      A thoughtful and convincing assessment of what happens when the rich world becomes over-accustomed to rising standards of living but cannot afford the benefits its governments have promised, by the chief economist at HSBC.

      This story of the transformation of a small online bookseller into an e-commerce behemoth has annoyed Amazon’s founder (and his wife, even more). Winner of the 2013 Financial Times/Goldman Sachs business book of the year award. Can’t be all bad.

       . By Lee Billings. Current; 294 pages; $27.95.

      Life After Life
       . By Kate Atkinson. Reagan Arthur Books; 544 pages; $27.99. Doubleday; £18.99.

       . By Donna Tartt. Little, Brown; 784 pages; $30 and £20.
      A Victorian tale (complete with an orphan’s moral education and the secrets of a heavy gold ring) fired up with the explosive device of a postmodern thriller. About love and loss, as well as art and its durability, Donna Tartt’s first novel in 11 years is worth the wait.
           
      Norwegian by Night
       . By Derek Miller. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 304 pages; $26. Faber and Faber; £7.99.

      If Britain’s politicians are among the world’s most honest, hardworking and well-meaning, why do they mess up so badly and so often? A trenchant book that will make you see red, even as you laugh.
           
      China Goes Global: The Partial Power
       . By David Shambaugh. Oxford University Press; 409 pages; $29.95 and £20.
      China’s footprint is “broad, but not deep”, argues David Shambaugh of George Washington University, which means it is not nearly as powerful as people think. As one of the few recent books that says China is not going to take over the world, this work is a welcome antidote to some of the widespread hyperventilating about China’s rise. Scholarly, fascinating and controversial.

       . By Robert Hilburn. Little, Brown; 679 pages; $32. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; £20.

       . By John Drury. Allen Lane; 396 pages; £25.
      To be published in America in April by University of Chicago Press; $35 Being an English country minister has inspired many writers, none of them more lapidary, precise, witty and surprising than George Herbert, the frail intellectual who preached to the parish of Bemerton from 1630 to 1633. An account of an Anglican priest and his poetry that will probably never be bettered.

       . By Gary Bass. Knopf; 499 pages; $30.

       . By Doris Kearns Goodwin. Simon &amp; Schuster; 928 pages; $40. Viking; £20.
      Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to install a press room in the White House, making journalists instantly more powerful and exacerbating tensions within his Republican Party. “The Bully Pulpit” captures the way a political party can be destroyed by factionalism, and shows the important role investigative reporters play in political life.

       . By Brendan Simms. Basic Books; 690 pages; $35. Allen Lane; £30.
      An original take on Europe’s history that shows that German power was a concern long before the country formally came into being in the late 19th century, and perhaps as far back as the mid-1400s. A compelling and provocative thesis that has lessons for politicians today.

      This story of the transformation of a small online bookseller into an e-commerce behemoth has annoyed Amazon’s founder (and his wife, even more). Winner of the 2013 Financial Times/Goldman Sachs business book of the year award. Can’t be all bad.

       . By Lee Billings. Current; 294 pages; $27.95.

      Ghana Must Go
       . By Taiye Selasi. Penguin Press; 318 pages; $25.95. Viking; £14.99.

       . By Donna Tartt. Little, Brown; 784 pages; $30 and £20.

      Norwegian by Night
       . By Derek Miller. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 304 pages; $26. Faber and Faber; £7.99.

       By Adelle Waldman. Henry Holt; 256 pages; $25. William Heinemann; £14.99.

       . By John Drury. Allen Lane; 396 pages; £25.
      To be published in America in April by University of Chicago Press; $35 Being an English country minister has inspired many writers, none of them more lapidary, precise, witty and surprising than George Herbert, the frail intellectual who preached to the parish of Bemerton from 1630 to 1633. An account of an Anglican priest and his poetry that will probably never be bettered.

      China’s footprint is “broad, but not deep”, argues David Shambaugh of George Washington University, which means it is not nearly as powerful as people think. As one of the few recent books that says China is not going to take over the world, this work is a welcome antidote to some of the widespread hyperventilating about China’s rise. Scholarly, fascinating and controversial.

      <p>China’s footprint is “broad, but not deep”, argues David Shambaugh of George Washington University, which means it is not nearly as powerful as people think. As one of the few recent books that says China is not going to take over the world, this work is a welcome antidote to some of the widespread hyperventilating about China’s rise. Scholarly, fascinating and controversial.</p>
