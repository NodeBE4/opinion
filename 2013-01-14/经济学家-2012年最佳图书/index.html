      Radio Congo: Signals of Hope from Africa’s Deadliest War
       . By Ben Rawlence. Oneworld; 320 pages.  A refreshing memoir that focuses on how people live in Africa’s second-biggest nation, rather than how they die—and for once does not mention Mr Kurtz.
         
      Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest
       . By Wade Davis. Knopf; 672 pages.  A haunting exploration of the 1920s Everest expeditions, told almost as myth and legend. Brilliantly interwoven with the story of how the first world war shaped these men, it is meticulously well researched and deftly told.
         
      The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot
       . By Robert Macfarlane. Viking; 433 pages.  How a Cambridge academic walked more than 7,000 miles and ended up lying on his back in deep snow, gazing up at the stars. A book of place and pilgrimage.
         
      On Warne
       . By Gideon Haigh. Simon &amp; Schuster; 224 pages.  The sport’s most accomplished historian finds something new to say about the finest cricketer of our time.

      Swim: Why We Love the Water
       . By Lynn Sherr. PublicAffairs; 232 pages.  At 69 and with a duff knee, the author trains enough to swim the Hellespont (like Lord Byron). All the skinny on dipping.
         
      Strands: A Year of Discoveries on the Beach
       . By Jean Sprackland. Jonathan Cape; 256 pages.  A gentle British poet writes of the encounters with “cargoes of mystery” that are delivered by each ocean tide.
         
      How to Stay Sane
       . By Philippa Perry. School of Life/Macmillan; 60 pages.  Sanity, Philippa Perry shows in this brilliant little book, is not about normality, but about how to maintain a flexible position between rigidity and chaos.

        Fiction, essays and poetry  
         
      Bring Up the Bodies
       . By Hilary Mantel. Henry Holt; 432 pages.  The second volume of the Man Booker prize-winning trilogy focuses on the travails of Henry VIII’s second wife, Anne Boleyn. A novel that is made by one brilliant word: “exsanguinated”.
         
      The Forgiven
       . By Lawrence Osborne. Hogarth; 288 pages.  A creepy novel that opens when a British couple, on their way to a lavish party in Morocco, run over and kill a young local man. A quick, streamlined novel with an end that is both surprising and dark.
         
      Toby’s Room
       . By Pat Barker. Doubleday; 320 pages.  Pat Barker’s first novel since her Man Booker prize-winning, “Regeneration” trilogy, is an enthralling and uplifting read despite the sorrow that is at the heart of every character in the story.
         
      The Dinner
       . By Herman Koch. Translated by Sam Garrett. Hogarth; 304 pages.  A family whodunnit in the theatrical setting of a five-course dinner. The summer’s best read gives new meaning to bad table manners.
         
      The Garden of Evening Mists
       . By Tan Twang Eng. Weinstein; 352 pages.  A haunting meditation on colonialism, gardens and tattooing, set against the Malay insurgency of the 1950s.
         
      Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm
       . By Philip Pullman. Viking; 400 pages.  A delightfully wry reworking, by a master storyteller, of the anarchic fairy tales of the brothers Grimm.
         
      Winter: Five Windows on the Season
       . By Adam Gopnik. Quercus; 288 pages.  No other season quite captures the imagination as winter does, and Adam Gopnik, a Canadian-raised writer at the New Yorker, is its greatest fan. Makes chilliness worth every minute.
         
      Pulphead: Essays
       . By John Jeremiah Sullivan. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 384 pages.  The Southern editor of the Paris Review can write as scintillatingly about the tea party, Michael Jackson or Hurricane Katrina as he can about rare Southern folk-blues or American reality television.
         
      Three Strong Women
       . By Marie N’Diaye. Translated by John Fletcher. Knopf; 304 pages.  Three women whose lives are strung between Africa and Europe find the strength to say no, by the winner of the 2009 Prix Goncourt.
         
      Yellow Tulips: Poems 1968-2011
       . By James Fenton. Faber and Faber; 176 pages.  James Fenton’s poetic voice has a simple lyricism and a vivid gracefulness. Most important, these poems suggest that at 63, he still has a great future.
         
      Place: New Poems
       . By Jorie Graham. Ecco; 96 pages.  An evocative new collection by a Pulitzer prize-winning poet. Set between New Hampshire, France and Northern Ireland, “Place” won the British Forward prize for poetry and has been nominated for the T.S. Eliot award.
