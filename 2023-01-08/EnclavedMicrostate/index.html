<p>ID isn’t much EU-friendlier than North America-based talents; the time gap is about the same but in the opposite direction, and not everyone has Kaela’s insane work ‘ethic’ where they essentially stream 24/7. I’ve been able to catch Zeta a lot but that’s because I’m on a university student’s schedule and have relatively high flexibility.</p>

<p>And it’s also not universally the case that ID is essentially an EN extension – I know Zeta, Reine, and to a great extent Ollie to be relatively EN-heavy, but on the other hand you have relatively Bahasa-heavy members like Kobo and Iofi. I’ve not watched enough of Moona, Risu, Anya, or Kaela to really get a strong sense of language balance there. On a related note it’s not implausible that those with stronger accents get passed over a bit, either (more accusatorily) because of some level of prejudice, or (more charitably) because it can require a little more attention to hear them properly. An added element is that some may be thrown off by the presence of any significant stretch of non-English language use and would prefer to be able to grasp the stream as a whole, but given IRyS’ popularity despite her relative bilinguality, that may not be the case – or viewers tolerate Japanese more.</p>

<p>Then we have to throw in the mix that collabs within HoloID are basically non-English even between the English-heavy members. If part of the draw of following a particular agency streamer is also the prospect of their bouncing off other members of the same agency relatively frequently, then it can be a little frustrating if those interactions are basically never in your language.</p>

<p>It’s also misleading to look at the r/hololive portion of the fandom and presume that the wider fandom is necessarily of similar mind. I rarely see much in the way of ID engagement by EN viewers on Twitter, and I suspect that anyone who is a relatively passive viewer, only really engaging via Youtube and not as active in fandom spaces, will a) not see much reason to click on a streamer with ‘hololive-ID’ prominently displayed, and b) may well not be recommended HoloID streamers by the algorithm.</p>

<p>So I don’t doubt there’s probably aspects of ‘exoticism’/racism/lighter prejudice involved, but there’s a few practicalities to it too, which is unfortunate because Zeta is great and everyone should watch her we are not a cult #ZETANISM2023</p>

<p>So, does anyone know how to unblock a Youtube channel from your account? In its infinite wisdom, Youtube put the ‘block channel’ button immediately under ‘show transcript’ and didn’t ask for a confirmation so now I’ve blocked Kiara apparently.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks to the three people who replied (/u/DanteKir, /u/JimmyBoombox, and /u/SillyRabbit000); turns out I did a big dumb.

<p>I tried the desktop route but she doesn’t turn up in my ‘Hidden users’; I assume that’s an option that really only applies for people blocking users from their own channel, rather than channels they view.

<p>This is heavily questionable. There’s a revisionist school of historians of Central Asia, most prominently Scott C.

An issue exists with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ybv8rr/is_the_qing_conquest_theory_that_the_qing_dynasty/itkm8nr/">‘Qing conquest theory’</a> where all of the individual citations are of articles that actually exist, but where the notion that these all belong to a single coherent historiographical school was invented by the article author. So the problem becomes, the <em>core</em> of the article is supported claims, but the <em>framing</em> is entirely synthetic. But the former has been reason enough to keep the article up, despite nobody being able to add any new scholarship contributing to the apparent ‘debate’ since its publication in 2010. And it has since made it into at least one academic publication: José Luis Gasch-Tomás’ <em>The Atlantic World and the Manila Galleons</em>, published by Brill (one of the major academic imprints) <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sqSODwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=%22qing+conquest+theory%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ki4v54t_OC&amp;sig=ACfU3U3_1dzcBoPQvTbCbcvV0qPXcM4K3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwibsouxs7T8AhUT3jgGHdgKCT44ChDoAXoECB0QAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22qing%20conquest%20theory%22&amp;f=false">addresses the notion of the ‘Qing conquest theory’ in a footnote</a>.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1038.1</strong> —–2023-01-09 00:24:26+08:00:</p>

<p>Historically, small ships have always had utility that has made them more viable to field (er, float?) in large numbers than big ones. Take the Imperial Japanese Navy for instance: going off Wikipedia’s numbers, over the course of WW2 it deployed 12 battleships and 13 fleet carriers for 25 total ‘heavy’ capital ships; add in its 7 light carriers, 10 escort carriers and 18 heavy cruisers and that’s 60 capital or capital-adjacent ships. But they also deployed 25 light cruisers, 169 fleet destroyers, 180 destroyer escorts, 21 lighter sea-going vessels, and 195 submarines. In other words, over three times as many submarines as capital(-ish) ships, and nearly <em>six</em> times as many destroyers. And the reason for that is simple: the small ships do tasks that it is impractical to use big ships for.</p>

<p>The core function of capital ships is to be heavy hitters in a decisive engagement: powerful weaponry and high survivability are the order of the day, and it is worth noting that capital ships could also often be pretty fast if they revved their engines up fully. But that doesn’t make them some kind of all-round superweapon. If you need to escort convoys long distances, you want ships that prioritise fuel capacity and efficiency, over weapons and armour if necessary. If you’re trying to attack such convoys, you want ships that have low detectability, high escape ability (whether by speed or stealth), and heavy offensive weaponry. If you need to patrol an area of coastline, six small ships with their own detection systems spread out across a wide area will do you far better than a single heavy ship with just one of those systems.</p>

<p>And smaller vessels can have a significant tactical role: destroyers in particular started out as torpedo boats whose role was to essentially Zerg rush battleships by using agility to avoid hits and sheer numbers to absorb them, then fire torpedoes that would hit the ship under the waterline and knock it out of action. ‘Torpedo boat destroyers’ were then built to counter these, and then over time the two simply merged into a single ship type with greater survivability. And the simple reality is that much as it would be ideal to just throw battleships at the problem, destroyers were purpose-built to destroy unescorted capital ships. You needed to have some kind of parity with your own destroyers to keep the enemy’s at a distance. In short, destroyers beat capital ships, but escorted capital ships beat destroyers, so you needed both in order to be successful.</p>

<p>How does this translate to Star Trek? Firstly, smaller ships are more efficient at carrying out tasks that you just need <em>a</em> ship for, not the <em>best</em> ship for. If you’re transporting some minor dignitary from one planet to another, a ship that only needs 100 crew will do the job just as well as a ship that needs 1000. Secondly, there are operational tasks for which small ships are outright better at doing the job if adjusted for cost. If you’re patrolling an area of space, two ships with souped-up sensors will do the job as well as a big ship with equivalent sensor power. Thirdly, there are situations where a small ship is just <em>better</em>. If you’re performing a stealth mission, a small ship with a small profile will be much more ideal than a big one. Arguably, it is only the tactical role where, because we don’t necessarily have a good sense of how ships scale in Trek, there doesn’t seem to be an obvious reason why larger numbers of smaller ships would be necessarily preferable. Two ships that are 50% the size of a Galaxy-class may well have the same total firepower, survivability, and target profile. <em>But</em>. Given that these ships have more <em>non</em>-tactical utility, that’s why they’re still around.</p>

<p>The thing is, the Federation’s model may not actually be impractical: it probably takes more resources to build a big ship than a small one, and we don’t quite know how the scalability works. The Dominion War necessitated building more ships <em>in general</em>, because the Federation had got away with having a comparatively small fleet <em>overall</em> up to that point.</p>

<p>It’d be tricky as China proper has historically not had a land border with the general South Asia region. While there was significant Chinese contact with Iran-based states, particularly the early Caliphates, this was mediated via Central Asia and a direct result of mutual competing interests in the earlier part of the Tang Empire’s existence, which coincided with a period of relative fragmentation in northern India. The only subsequent contacts into South Asia would therefore have had to involve either competing interest in Central Asia or in Tibet, which is why ultimately the first significant ‘Sino’-‘Indian’ contacts would be under the Qing: the conflicts with Nepal in the 1790s and the Sikh Empire in the 1840s. That’s not to say there was not interest, nor, more importantly, that private individuals did not travel from one to the other, but it is to say that actual diplomacy was pretty limited. The thing to read on this is Matthew Mosca’s <em>From Frontier Policy to Foreign Policy</em>, which discusses Qing impressions of India and relations with Indian states and latterly the East India Company. You may also be interested in <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/saksaha/13401746.0018.002?view=text;rgn=main">this article</a> also by Mosca which discusses early Manchu claims to suzerainty over India.</p>

<p>Huh. I knew that the Japanese side of Multiple AI was reworked into two new VTubers outright but I had no idea the Chinese side was retained. I wrote about Multiple AI <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/th0gow/virtual_youtubers_the_first_years_of_vtubing/">here</a> but as said, no idea the Chinese side had continued.</p>

<p>I’m going purely off plot summary and wider context here, but it feels like the story of Wu Zetian is the easiest one to fall into a girlboss trap over. I’m also going to say this: for someone who publicly decries Han chauvinism, choosing to present peoples beyond SciFi!China as literal mythological-alien monster creatures is a <em>choice</em>, even if it is ultimately subverted by revealing the setting is in fact a colonial one, with Space!China as the coloniser. The issue is, even if you do agree that the subversion undercuts the ostensible problem, you then run into a historical issue: for the <em>most</em> part the Tang frontier to the north was not a continually expanding colonial border where Han Chinese had simply transplanted themselves (a la the south): the areas of Han settlement and the nomadic fringe had been broadly defined for a long time (albeit very much blending into each other). So then the analogy becomes confused.</p>

<p>Nora Cat, not to be confused with Noraneko. This happened in February 2018, barely 10 months after their original debut and decidedly in the very early years of VTubing – per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/mfzssc/here_are_the_30_oldest_vtubers_in_the_industry/">this post</a> on r/VirtualYoutubers,  Nora Cat was the second VTuber <em>ever</em> if we start counting from Kizuna AI, and my unsubstantiated estimate would have it that fewer than 100 VTubers even existed at the time of the leak, compared to at least 20,000 as of November last year <a href="https://www.userlocal.jp/press/20221129vt/">per data analysis site UserLocal</a>.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.7</strong> —–2023-01-11 09:56:12+08:00:</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://data.nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oyaku-e1517959734945.jpg">the middle image of this screenshot</a> is what the incident looked like. Bear in mind that as noted, Nora Cat was pretty much the second VTuber ever if we go by a Kizuna AI-based definition, and was essentially created from scratch as a solo project. Whatever method they were using seems to have involved the following process, which most Live2D and 3D programs technically use:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The camera records their face directly.</li>
  <li>Facial recognition trickery marks out the position of their facial features to produce a ‘mask’.</li>
  <li>The model is then basically mapped onto the mask.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, they did not have the benefit of commercial programs that just outputted the end product. Instead, all three stages were technically being hosted directly on their stream setup. The raw footage, the mask, and the final model were all layered on top of each other, but the raw footage and the mask were usually transparent. On this occasion, the transparencies seem to have been flipped, thus leading to the incident.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.8</strong> —–2023-01-11 10:22:57+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this was a couple years ago so they were probably using prprlive or facerig</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was February 2018 and they started out in April 2017; as far as I’m aware their setup (with 3D model incidentally) was scratchbuilt or at least highly improvised.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.9</strong> —–2023-01-13 02:38:04+08:00:</p>

<p>So, I legitimately did not know that Bushiroad was behind <em>BanG Dream!</em>, I thought they just did TCGs. Now that I do know, their sponsorship of Hololive’s 3rd major live concert suddenly makes a whole lot more sense.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.10</strong> —–2023-01-13 03:02:29+08:00:</p>

<p>Ah, which also gives context to Great-O-Khan, of Bushiroad-owned New Japan Pro Wrestling, being a fan of Hololive member Oozora Subaru to the point of having a move specifically based on a lock she performs in an animated episode.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl9rrADVWI8">I’m not joking.</a></p>

<p>Welcome to the DS9 club! And incidentally, it’s me, I am the Sisko stan.</p>
