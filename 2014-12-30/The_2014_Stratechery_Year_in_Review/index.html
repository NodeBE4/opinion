     The 2014 Stratechery Year in Review 
    
  Posted on             Tuesday, December 30, 2014

    2014 was Stratechery’s second year, and what a momentous one it was! In April Stratechery  became my full-time job  , and although I  made some quick changes  to the model, it’s  been a big success  . It has certainly kept me busy: in 2014 I wrote 88 free articles, 169 Daily Updates, and recorded 41 podcasts (29 of them were  Exponent  episodes).
    Here are the highlights (the 2013 edition is  here  ):
    
         
Peak Google
      
    
     The Five Most-Viewed Articles: 
    
       Peak Google  – Google owns search, and will continue to do so. But the online ad market is about to get a lot bigger, and it’s not clear that Google will win. They may be eclipsed like Microsoft before them
       Apple Watch: Asking Why and Saying No  – Apple Watch is beautiful and has many compelling features, but Apple never said why it exists. Has that led them to do too much? (Note that I later changed my mind: see  What I Got Wrong About Apple Watch  and  Why Now for Apple Watch  )
       Smartphone Truths and Samsung’s Inevitable Decline  – All of the reasons to buy high-end Samsung phones are disappearing; Apple, meanwhile, will always have software-based differentiation and a big market to address
       It’s Time to Kill Surface  – It’s important to evaluate products – like the Xbox and Surface – in the light of their original goals. If you do that, then it’s clear Surface has failed
       Two Microsofts  – Making Mobile Office (nearly) free bring a lot of clarity to MIcrosoft’s business: it’s actually two different ones – consumer and enterprise
    
    
         
PayPal’s Incentive Problem, and Why Startups Win
      
    
     Five Big Ideas 
    
       Messaging: Mobile’s Killer App  – Messaging is the killer app on mobile, but only LINE and WeChat have created true platforms that are true multi-sided markets (in another happy coincidence, this post was written one day before  Facebook acquired WhatsApp  )
       Netflix and Net Neutrality  – There are fundamental tradeoffs between broadband investment, non-discriminatory treatment of data, and unlimited access. Netflix depends on the third
      I wrote a three-part series on journalism in the Internet age:  FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average  ,  The Stages of Newspapers’ Decline  ,  Newspapers are Dead; Long Live Journalism 
       How Technology is Changing the World (P&amp;G Edition)  – P&amp;G announced they are cutting their brand portfolio in half, and the changes wrought by technology – including social media and e-commerce – are why
       The State of Consumer Technology at the End of 2014  – The three epochs of computing to date – PC, web, and mobile – and what is next
    
    
         
How Apple Creates Leverage and the Future of Apple Pay

       It’s Time to Split Up Microsoft  – Satya Nadella is saying all of the right things, but Microsoft’s culture has always been Windows first. The solution is to get rid of Windows

       Why Uber Fights  – Big business is brutally competitive, and a very big business is exactly what Uber is fighting for. Their potential is absolutely massive
    
    
         
Publishers and the Smiling Curve
      
    
     Five Daily Updates 
    (Please note that these are subscriber-only links – you can sign-up  here  )
    
       August 5  – Xiaomi Wins on More than Price, Micromax and Local Taste, Local Brands and Scale
       October 22  – The Disruption of IBM, An Alternate View of IBM’s 2015 Profit Goal, IMB Sells Fabs to Global Foundries
       November 12  – Taylor Swift vs Daniel Elk, What Swift Gets Right, The Problem with Spotify
       December 1  – Why Vox (and BuzzFeed) are Valuable, Outbrain Files for IPO
       December 2  – The Solo Selfie and its Cool Factor, The Donut Selfie and its Creator
    
    
         
Dependent on Digital Whales
      
    
     Five Podcasts 
    
       Exponent Episode 005: The World Has Changed  – Not only has the Internet fundamentally changed winners-and-losers, but also the very nature of economic competition and the type of regulation that is required
       Exponent Episode 012: The Internet Rainforest  – The Internet is enabling not only big winners, but also small, focused niche players, and why that’s exciting
       Exponent Episode 016: Naked People  – James’ first ever trip to Burning Man, ugliness in modern culture and on the Internet, the new divide in politics, and ultimately why we have hope for the future
       Exponent Episode 024: A Celebratory Goblet of Champagne  – The idea for Exponent was hatched when Ben and James were arguing about Ben’s article  What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong  a year ago. In this episode, we finally reach a resolution to the question about how Apple escapes disruption
       The Talk Show: Free Alcoholic Beverages  – I joined John Gruber on  The Talk Show  where we talked about Samsung’s struggles, Xiaomi, wearables, and a whole lot more
    
    Happy New Year. I’m looking forward to a great 2015.

     The 2014 Stratechery Year in Review 
    
  Posted on             Tuesday, December 30, 2014 
            Thursday, March 7, 2019 
     Author  by  Ben Thompson   
    
    
  
  
  
    2014 was Stratechery’s second year, and what a momentous one it was! In April Stratechery  became my full-time job  , and although I  made some quick changes  to the model, it’s  been a big success  . It has certainly kept me busy: in 2014 I wrote 88 free articles, 169 Daily Updates, and recorded 41 podcasts (29 of them were  Exponent  episodes).
    Here are the highlights (the 2013 edition is  here  ):
    
         
Peak Google
      
    
     The Five Most-Viewed Articles: 
    
       Peak Google  – Google owns search, and will continue to do so. But the online ad market is about to get a lot bigger, and it’s not clear that Google will win. They may be eclipsed like Microsoft before them
       Apple Watch: Asking Why and Saying No  – Apple Watch is beautiful and has many compelling features, but Apple never said why it exists. Has that led them to do too much? (Note that I later changed my mind: see  What I Got Wrong About Apple Watch  and  Why Now for Apple Watch  )
       Smartphone Truths and Samsung’s Inevitable Decline  – All of the reasons to buy high-end Samsung phones are disappearing; Apple, meanwhile, will always have software-based differentiation and a big market to address
       It’s Time to Kill Surface  – It’s important to evaluate products – like the Xbox and Surface – in the light of their original goals. If you do that, then it’s clear Surface has failed
       Two Microsofts  – Making Mobile Office (nearly) free bring a lot of clarity to MIcrosoft’s business: it’s actually two different ones – consumer and enterprise
    
    
         
PayPal’s Incentive Problem, and Why Startups Win
      
    
     Five Big Ideas 
    
       Messaging: Mobile’s Killer App  – Messaging is the killer app on mobile, but only LINE and WeChat have created true platforms that are true multi-sided markets (in another happy coincidence, this post was written one day before  Facebook acquired WhatsApp  )
       Netflix and Net Neutrality  – There are fundamental tradeoffs between broadband investment, non-discriminatory treatment of data, and unlimited access. Netflix depends on the third
      I wrote a three-part series on journalism in the Internet age:  FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average  ,  The Stages of Newspapers’ Decline  ,  Newspapers are Dead; Long Live Journalism 
       How Technology is Changing the World (P&amp;G Edition)  – P&amp;G announced they are cutting their brand portfolio in half, and the changes wrought by technology – including social media and e-commerce – are why
       The State of Consumer Technology at the End of 2014  – The three epochs of computing to date – PC, web, and mobile – and what is next
    
    
         
How Apple Creates Leverage and the Future of Apple Pay
      
    
     Five Company-Specific Posts 
    
       Twitter’s Marketing Problem  – Twitter’s initial product was so good that they never went to the trouble of understanding their market, and now they are paying the price.
       It’s Time to Split Up Microsoft  – Satya Nadella is saying all of the right things, but Microsoft’s culture has always been Windows first. The solution is to get rid of Windows
       How Apple Creates Leverage, and the Future of Apple Pay  – How Apple Creates Leverage, and the Future of Apple Pay
       Best  – Apple avoids disruption by creating a superior user experience. That requires focus, and any advice to the contrary doesn’t make sense
       Why Uber Fights  – Big business is brutally competitive, and a very big business is exactly what Uber is fighting for. Their potential is absolutely massive
    
    
         
Publishers and the Smiling Curve
      
    
     Five Daily Updates 
    (Please note that these are subscriber-only links – you can sign-up  here  )
    
       August 5  – Xiaomi Wins on More than Price, Micromax and Local Taste, Local Brands and Scale
       October 22  – The Disruption of IBM, An Alternate View of IBM’s 2015 Profit Goal, IMB Sells Fabs to Global Foundries
       November 12  – Taylor Swift vs Daniel Elk, What Swift Gets Right, The Problem with Spotify
       December 1  – Why Vox (and BuzzFeed) are Valuable, Outbrain Files for IPO
       December 2  – The Solo Selfie and its Cool Factor, The Donut Selfie and its Creator
    
    
         
Dependent on Digital Whales
      
    
     Five Podcasts

     The 2014 Stratechery Year in Review 
    
  Posted on             Tuesday, December 30, 2014 
            Thursday, March 7, 2019 
     Author  by  Ben Thompson   
    
    
  
  
  
    2014 was Stratechery’s second year, and what a momentous one it was! In April Stratechery  became my full-time job  , and although I  made some quick changes  to the model, it’s  been a big success  . It has certainly kept me busy: in 2014 I wrote 88 free articles, 169 Daily Updates, and recorded 41 podcasts (29 of them were  Exponent  episodes).
    Here are the highlights (the 2013 edition is  here  ):
    
         
Peak Google
      
    
     The Five Most-Viewed Articles: 
    
       Peak Google  – Google owns search, and will continue to do so. But the online ad market is about to get a lot bigger, and it’s not clear that Google will win. They may be eclipsed like Microsoft before them
       Apple Watch: Asking Why and Saying No  – Apple Watch is beautiful and has many compelling features, but Apple never said why it exists. Has that led them to do too much? (Note that I later changed my mind: see  What I Got Wrong About Apple Watch  and  Why Now for Apple Watch  )
       Smartphone Truths and Samsung’s Inevitable Decline  – All of the reasons to buy high-end Samsung phones are disappearing; Apple, meanwhile, will always have software-based differentiation and a big market to address
       It’s Time to Kill Surface  – It’s important to evaluate products – like the Xbox and Surface – in the light of their original goals. If you do that, then it’s clear Surface has failed
       Two Microsofts  – Making Mobile Office (nearly) free bring a lot of clarity to MIcrosoft’s business: it’s actually two different ones – consumer and enterprise
    
    
         
PayPal’s Incentive Problem, and Why Startups Win
      
    
     Five Big Ideas 
    
       Messaging: Mobile’s Killer App  – Messaging is the killer app on mobile, but only LINE and WeChat have created true platforms that are true multi-sided markets (in another happy coincidence, this post was written one day before  Facebook acquired WhatsApp  )
       Netflix and Net Neutrality  – There are fundamental tradeoffs between broadband investment, non-discriminatory treatment of data, and unlimited access. Netflix depends on the third
      I wrote a three-part series on journalism in the Internet age:  FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average  ,  The Stages of Newspapers’ Decline  ,  Newspapers are Dead; Long Live Journalism 
       How Technology is Changing the World (P&amp;G Edition)  – P&amp;G announced they are cutting their brand portfolio in half, and the changes wrought by technology – including social media and e-commerce – are why
       The State of Consumer Technology at the End of 2014  – The three epochs of computing to date – PC, web, and mobile – and what is next
    
    
         
How Apple Creates Leverage and the Future of Apple Pay
      
    
     Five Company-Specific Posts 
    
       Twitter’s Marketing Problem  – Twitter’s initial product was so good that they never went to the trouble of understanding their market, and now they are paying the price.
       It’s Time to Split Up Microsoft  – Satya Nadella is saying all of the right things, but Microsoft’s culture has always been Windows first. The solution is to get rid of Windows
       How Apple Creates Leverage, and the Future of Apple Pay  – How Apple Creates Leverage, and the Future of Apple Pay
       Best  – Apple avoids disruption by creating a superior user experience. That requires focus, and any advice to the contrary doesn’t make sense
       Why Uber Fights  – Big business is brutally competitive, and a very big business is exactly what Uber is fighting for. Their potential is absolutely massive
    
    
         
Publishers and the Smiling Curve
      
    
     Five Daily Updates 
    (Please note that these are subscriber-only links – you can sign-up  here  )
    
       August 5  – Xiaomi Wins on More than Price, Micromax and Local Taste, Local Brands and Scale
       October 22  – The Disruption of IBM, An Alternate View of IBM’s 2015 Profit Goal, IMB Sells Fabs to Global Foundries
       November 12  – Taylor Swift vs Daniel Elk, What Swift Gets Right, The Problem with Spotify
       December 1  – Why Vox (and BuzzFeed) are Valuable, Outbrain Files for IPO
       December 2  – The Solo Selfie and its Cool Factor, The Donut Selfie and its Creator
    
    
         
Dependent on Digital Whales
      
    
     Five Podcasts 
    
       Exponent Episode 005: The World Has Changed  – Not only has the Internet fundamentally changed winners-and-losers, but also the very nature of economic competition and the type of regulation that is required
       Exponent Episode 012: The Internet Rainforest  – The Internet is enabling not only big winners, but also small, focused niche players, and why that’s exciting
       Exponent Episode 016: Naked People  – James’ first ever trip to Burning Man, ugliness in modern culture and on the Internet, the new divide in politics, and ultimately why we have hope for the future
       Exponent Episode 024: A Celebratory Goblet of Champagne  – The idea for Exponent was hatched when Ben and James were arguing about Ben’s article  What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong  a year ago. In this episode, we finally reach a resolution to the question about how Apple escapes disruption
       The Talk Show: Free Alcoholic Beverages  – I joined John Gruber on  The Talk Show  where we talked about Samsung’s struggles, Xiaomi, wearables, and a whole lot more
    
    Happy New Year. I’m looking forward to a great 2015.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>2014 was Stratechery’s second year, and what a momentous one it was! In April Stratechery <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/welcome-stratechery-20/"> became my full-time job </a> , and although I <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/free-stratechery-daily-email/"> made some quick changes </a> to the model, it’s <a href="stratechery.com/2014/update-stratechery-membership-program/"> been a big success </a> . It has certainly kept me busy: in 2014 I wrote 88 free articles, 169 Daily Updates, and recorded 41 podcasts (29 of them were <a href="http://exponent.fm"> Exponent </a> episodes).</p>
    <p>Here are the highlights (the 2013 edition is <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/stratechery-2013-year-review/"> here </a> ):</p>
    <figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1199" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1199" style="width: 600px">

    <h4 id="the-five-most-viewed-articles-"> The Five Most-Viewed Articles: </h4>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/peak-google/"> Peak Google </a> – Google owns search, and will continue to do so. But the online ad market is about to get a lot bigger, and it’s not clear that Google will win. They may be eclipsed like Microsoft before them</li>
      <li><a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/apple-watch-asking-saying/"> Apple Watch: Asking Why and Saying No </a> – Apple Watch is beautiful and has many compelling features, but Apple never said why it exists. Has that led them to do too much? (Note that I later changed my mind: see <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/got-wrong-apple-watch/"> What I Got Wrong About Apple Watch </a> and <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/now-apple-watch/"> Why Now for Apple Watch </a> )</li>
      <li><a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/smartphone-truths-samsungs-inevitable-decline/"> Smartphone Truths and Samsung’s Inevitable Decline </a> – All of the reasons to buy high-end Samsung phones are disappearing; Apple, meanwhile, will always have software-based differentiation and a big market to address</li>

      <li><a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/two-microsofts/"> Two Microsofts </a> – Making Mobile Office (nearly) free bring a lot of clarity to MIcrosoft’s business: it’s actually two different ones – consumer and enterprise</li>
