       Steven Pinker, 
     Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress
     
      
        By:  爱德布克  . 2017-11-28.  2,683 
      
    
    
      The follow-up to Pinker’s groundbreaking  
      The Better Angels of Our Nature
       presents the big picture of human progress: people are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and while our problems are formidable, the solutions lie in the Enlightenment ideal of using reason and science.
         Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.
      Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature–tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking–which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.   
      With intellectual depth and literary flair,  
      Enlightenment Now
       makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.

      The Better Angels of Our Nature
     </em> </a> presents the big picture of human progress: people are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and while our problems are formidable, the solutions lie in the Enlightenment ideal of using reason and science.</p>
      <p><a href="http://amzn.to/2k5PR8S"> <img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cWT1TOr9L._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="float:right;margin:5px 0px 35px 45px;border:1px solid" /> </a> Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.</p>
      <p>Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature–tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking–which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation. <br /> <span id="more-2635"> </span></p>

      Enlightenment Now
     </em> </a> makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.</p>
