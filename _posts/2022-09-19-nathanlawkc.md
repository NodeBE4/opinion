Excited to be part of the @perryworldhouse family. It was a rewarding experience to be a fellow at @UChiPolitics last year. Students were eager to learn, and sharing my experience with them helped me to grow as an activist.<br>I look forward to my one-week-long stay at UPenn.<br><br>Perry World House: .@nathanlawkc is a Hong Kong activist, currently in exile and based in London. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 alongside fellow pro-democracy student activists Joshua Wong and Alex Chow:<br><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdMwdgLaUAIBHAn?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> <a href="https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/expert/nathan-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/expert/nathan-law</a>

Interesting. <br>China's been Russia's strongest ally. Though CCP's not publicly endorsed the war, but their campaign of praising Putin &amp; expanding their economic tides shows their stance.<br>This could be a hedging move from China, which means Russia is really in big trouble/ losing.<br><br>Dmytro Kuleba: I met with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss relations between Ukraine and China. My counterpart reaffirmed China’s respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as its rejection of the use of force as a means of resolving differences.<br><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdU0Q9PWQAAuFrJ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

The Iranian govt supports Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine, suppression of Hong Kong democratic movement, and many other dictators.<br>Human rights activists should be united and support the Iranian protestors fighting for women's rights and a free country.<br>#IranProtests #ایران<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdWTKwUWIAAbZm1?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
