### 113: [Bond Between China and Russia Alarms U.S. and Europe Amid Ukraine Crisis](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/sx4wo8/bond_between_china_and_russia_alarms_us_and/), submitted on 2022-02-21 00:23:50+08:00.

Submission Statement:  

There is growing concern among leaders and stakeholders in Washington and Europe on the future of Sino-Russian relations.  Sino-Russian relations have historically been tenuous at best, facing numerous and significant challenges even throughout the Cold War.  Yet, the status quo appears to be changing.  In a [recent a forward-looking joint statement](https://archive.fo/o4hU9) from Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping suggests the possibility for [significantly more](https://archive.fo/My2Fq) based on shared interests.  Ukraine was not mentioned, though Xi explicitly backed Russia's opposition to any further enlargement of NATO membership.  Likewise, Putin echoed Xi's opposition to Taiwan's having "any form of independence."  This article examines the relationship between Russia and China and considers implications to Western interests.

That's a very good observation.  I think that article's characterizing Wang's statements as "humiliating" to Vladimir Putin are hyperbolic, but I agree that China would have reservations about supporting Russia invading Ukraine under the current circumstances.  Read together in context, what should be taken from the joint statement and Wang's comments is that Putin stands to lose future Chinese cooperation if he acts too precipitously in Ukraine and it plays out badly.  But there's a lot left open to question, too.

----- __113.3__ -----2022-02-21 01:08:18+08:00:

That doesn't make sense.  China regards Taiwan as a part of China.  See generally, "One China" policy.  Russia does not recognize the additional parts of Ukraine it purportedly considers invading as its own.  The issue is whether, if Russia further invades Ukraine and annexes it outright without answer from NATO, what precedent does that set for China's interests related to Taiwan?  Will Western interests stand behind Taiwan or not?  That's one of the main unresolved questions.

----- __113.4__ -----2022-02-21 01:17:02+08:00:

> First, China eclipsed Russian power quite some time ago, but Russia would refuse to be the junior partner in such an arrangement for a variety of reasons.

I agree with the above.  Somewhat related to your second point, from a tactical perspective, Beijing sees Russia as a relationship of temporal convenience --- and little more.  The current extent to which Russia and China are cooperating is alarming to most in the West who are paying attention.  But, Russia's unwillingness to be the servient partner is an existential barrier to long-term Sino-Russian cooperation.  

Geopolitical reality precludes anything long term.  This is also an unresolved challenge for China's envisioned future of Belt and Road.

> People keep repeating this, but it has little basis in reality. All the border disputes were settled in 2004. There is almost no practical reason for this either.

I agree with this as well, though China's interest in Siberia has less to do with border conflicts and more to do with over-land transportation.  Namely, moving cargo across the former Soviet rail network, as demonstrated by China's Khorgos-based land port.

I make no comment on this article, but it has been shared elsewhere and offers a perspective on these issues.

Thank you.  It's just a matter of recognizing where the pieces sit on the chessboard, and being able to anticipate the next couple of moves.

### 115: [It's getting increasingly difficult to tell the difference between "real" wokeism and "fake" wokeism because everything is so absurd lately](https://old.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/sx8rxg/its_getting_increasingly_difficult_to_tell_the/), submitted on 2022-02-21 03:11:50+08:00.

----- __115.1__ -----2022-02-21 09:07:36+08:00:

Being woke is no more than a Nietzschen power play, where the "oppressed" --- or those purportedly speaking on their behalf --- invent "injustice" by something approximating divine revelation.  Its primary purpose is to keep the working and middle classes fighting amongst themselves, rather than against the billionaires and ruling classes.  In the same way you distract babies with shiny objects or cats with laser pointers, so too the ruling elites distract working/middle class liberals with identity politics.

No, more like Whitefish, Montana.  Or Banff, Alberta.  Eastern United States doesn't have mountains like that.

> My SO is a rule follower no matter how dumb the rule is.  Fine with me, do what you're comfortable with.

Ha.  I can relate, from past relationships.  And yes, fine with me too, so long as you don't try to make me comply.

Edit: It is hilarious how quickly people have down-voted this, assuming that the only thing I was talking about was masks.  

I was thinking about complying with "rules" at my last significant other's parents' house on holiday visits, all pre-COVID.  Rules like "don't argue with my dad about politics," or "don't correct my dad when he says something stupid because it will make everyone uncomfortable and he already doesn't like you."

### 119: [When Will Chicago End Vaccine Card Requirement? Here’s What We Know](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/sxs2pd/when_will_chicago_end_vaccine_card_requirement/), submitted on 2022-02-21 20:11:32+08:00.

----- __119.1__ -----2022-02-21 20:19:25+08:00:

Allison Arwady once again tries to re-assert her relevance, in a press conference betraying the extent to which her relevance wanes precipitously.  

As if the last three plus months have meant nothing, Arwady makes reference to free-floating notions of "risk," based on metrics set according to pre-omicron hypothesized correlations (e.g., between cases and hospitalizations or fatalities).  Meanwhile, Chicagoans are increasingly unable to suspend disbelief, in order to take her incompetence seriously.

----- __119.2__ -----2022-02-21 21:43:09+08:00:

That’s to be expected.

Policy ought to be downstream from science, but that means that if your proposed mitigation efforts are empirical failures you take notice.
