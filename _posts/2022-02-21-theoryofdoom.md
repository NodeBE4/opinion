Submission Statement:  

There is growing concern among leaders and stakeholders in Washington and Europe on the future of Sino-Russian relations.  Sino-Russian relations have historically been tenuous at best, facing numerous and significant challenges even throughout the Cold War.  Yet, the status quo appears to be changing.  In a [recent a forward-looking joint statement](https://archive.fo/o4hU9) from Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping suggests the possibility for [significantly more](https://archive.fo/My2Fq) based on shared interests.  Ukraine was not mentioned, though Xi explicitly backed Russia's opposition to any further enlargement of NATO membership.  Likewise, Putin echoed Xi's opposition to Taiwan's having "any form of independence."
