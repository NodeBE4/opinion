The latest in the CMP Dictionary: "Not Forgetting the Original Intention" (不忘初心), a phrase denoting Xi Jinping's role as the torch bearer of the CCP's intention and mission through its 100-year history. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/not-forgetting-the-original-intention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/not-forgetting-the-original-intention/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQmRivbacAUO9G3?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

In today's People's Daily, China urges a "correct view" of security to create general safety for all. Not surprisingly, this is China's “constructive" view (中国的建设性立场), opposed to the "Cold War view" of "NATO as led by the US" 美国主导的北约抱持冷战思维.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQmT1oRagAEcCOW?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Page 9 of today's People's Daily is a good 101 on the CCP's views on democracy and human rights, both contained within the hard shell of Party power. 1/5 <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-04/18/nw.D110000renmrb_20220418_1-09.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-04/18/nw.D110000renmrb_20220418_1-09.htm</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQmVQX5aIAUCHp2?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re China's "HR development path" 中国人权发展道路 is based on several things: 1) "adhering to the leadership of the CCP" 2) "adhering to the primacy of the people." The CCP is on top, but insists people are primary. Puzzled by this? Trans: the Party decides FOR them.

Re 3) HR in China "proceeds from practical circumstances." This is only a bit about pragmatism. It's very ideological too -- classic materialism versus idealism. What the CCP decides as the bearer of 21st century Marxism IS practical, period.

Re 4) China's view of HR "adheres to the right to existence" 生存权 and the "right to development" 发展权. So draw investment, drive GDP and build railways and you've done your job -- no need for fussy idealist things like freedom of speech as focus on its own.

Re 5) Finally, China's view of human rights is about upholding rule of law (坚持依法保障人权) and 6) actively participating in global human rights governance 坚持积极参与全球人权治理 -- obviously on the above principles.

Re Finally, don't forget the first principle in Chinese human rights: that the CCP runs the entire process.
