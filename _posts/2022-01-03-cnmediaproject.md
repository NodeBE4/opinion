2022 has hardly begun, but for CCP propaganda ministers there can be no doubt that the year’s biggest news story will be the CCP congress starting 10+ months from now. Quick take on the propaganda ministers' conference. <a href="https://bit.ly/3EZo1i4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3EZo1i4</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIZo32KacAcpW-I?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Key question: When are social media accounts personal? And when are they being disingenuous about the state agendas they serve? . . . @schoenmakersk looks at clearly-state strategies from the CCP to exploit this ambiguity and use "personal brands" for conduct external propaganda.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIi2MkgaAAEyXSO?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re In at least six cases, Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine shows Chinese state media journalists removing their employers from their social media bios over the past 2 years, perhaps trying to avoid the "China state-affiliated media" label -- and enabling them to advertise.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIi2ZejaQAEi4hP?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Just stumbled across this wonderful historical example of how CCP official discourse reverberates through all disciplines in China in ways that are often absurd and giggle-inducing. Well-needed humor as we head into a year of pre-20th Congress CCP gobbledygook.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIjvXcjaUAE1zq0?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
