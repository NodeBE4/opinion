### 865: [Has there ever been a proven case of arranged war in history?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/xzzric/has_there_ever_been_a_proven_case_of_arranged_war/), submitted on 2022-10-10 07:40:07+08:00.

Bigger correction to add to /u/Trevor_Culley's – it was 300 each, with 2 Argives surviving and 1 Spartan, and neither side could decide who won so they fought a full-sized battle anyway.

### 866: [incredibly idiotic. isn't even a burger. covered in disgusting amounts of cheese. I'm ashamed to say that I would absolutely eat this and succumb to whatever ailment it brings.](https://old.reddit.com/r/StupidFood/comments/y016pd/incredibly_idiotic_isnt_even_a_burger_covered_in/), submitted on 2022-10-10 08:50:39+08:00.

IDK, as long as there was *less* of it I'd eat it. Proportions are fine, total size is a big oof.

### 867: [What does this say](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseTranslation/comments/y05owc/what_does_this_say/), submitted on 2022-10-10 12:43:47+08:00.

It's a eulogy of Mao Zedong:

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

### 869: [Is there evidence for the biblical exodus and more specifically is the Admonitions of Ipuwer evidence of the exodus?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y081gc/is_there_evidence_for_the_biblical_exodus_and/), submitted on 2022-10-10 15:02:28+08:00.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 870: [Voluntarist vs Structuralist](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseHistory/comments/y10s4o/voluntarist_vs_structuralist/), submitted on 2022-10-11 13:35:53+08:00.

----- __870.1__ -----2022-10-11 14:31:21+08:00:

Your previous post was removed because it was explicitly soliciting for help with homework, which is, to put it simply, a bit ethically dubious.
