### 865: [Has there ever been a proven case of arranged war in history?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/xzzric/has_there_ever_been_a_proven_case_of_arranged_war/), submitted on 2022-10-10 07:40:07+08:00.

Bigger correction to add to /u/Trevor_Culley's – it was 300 each, with 2 Argives surviving and 1 Spartan, and neither side could decide who won so they fought a full-sized battle anyway.

### 866: [incredibly idiotic. isn't even a burger. covered in disgusting amounts of cheese. I'm ashamed to say that I would absolutely eat this and succumb to whatever ailment it brings.](https://old.reddit.com/r/StupidFood/comments/y016pd/incredibly_idiotic_isnt_even_a_burger_covered_in/), submitted on 2022-10-10 08:50:39+08:00.

IDK, as long as there was *less* of it I'd eat it. Proportions are fine, total size is a big oof.

### 867: [What does this say](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseTranslation/comments/y05owc/what_does_this_say/), submitted on 2022-10-10 12:43:47+08:00.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

### 869: [Is there evidence for the biblical exodus and more specifically is the Admonitions of Ipuwer evidence of the exodus?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y081gc/is_there_evidence_for_the_biblical_exodus_and/), submitted on 2022-10-10 15:02:28+08:00.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 870: [Mindless Monday, 10 October 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/y0bsdf/mindless_monday_10_october_2022/), submitted on 2022-10-10 19:00:09+08:00.

----- __870.1__ -----2022-10-12 04:57:49+08:00:

> Obviously, the genocidal action must take a substantial toll on its target.

Define 'substantial', because wherever you draw the line, *someone* will find *some event* that is *just shy* and ask why that arbitrarily doesn't count.

Or rather, the key thing is that genocide is about intentions and not about scope.

> It's not enough to prove that there have been cases of forced sterilization because, guess what, there's been cases of forced sterilizations of Han women too, China is shitty to all of its people.

Well, even beyond the sterilisations, the evidence for specific targeting of Uighurs and Kazakhs (as the principal representatives of Turkic Muslim groups) is extremely clear: there has been overt settlement of Han Chinese people in Xinjiang to out-populate the indigenous population, *only* Turkic-speakers and Muslims have been placed in concentration camps, there is active suppression of non-Mandarin languages and Islam, including the destruction of mosques, etc. It's not like China is also trying to force Han Chinese people to drop Mandarin or blowing up Confucian sites at the same time that it's suppressing Uighur and Kazakh and demolishing mosques.

But on the sterilisation point, that there may be individual sterilisations of Han women does not change the broad trend, that being [antinatalism towards Uighurs and Kazakhs and pronatalism towards Han women](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/abortion-china), in which reproductive autonomy is curtailed towards ends that are unavoidably eugenicist in nature.

### 871: [Moderator of an unnamed "anti-racist subreddit" takes to /r/ModSupport to demand the admins explain their "draconian" and "unjustifiable" removal of a mod for violating a week-old rule. Shockingly, the story falls apart with the bombshell revelation of (checks notes) the subreddit's name.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/y0pmm9/moderator_of_an_unnamed_antiracist_subreddit/), submitted on 2022-10-11 04:48:15+08:00.

----- __871.1__ -----2022-10-11 16:08:52+08:00:

Was it ever good? I can only ever remember it being a supremacist sub.

### 872: [Voluntarist vs Structuralist](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseHistory/comments/y10s4o/voluntarist_vs_structuralist/), submitted on 2022-10-11 13:35:53+08:00.

----- __872.1__ -----2022-10-11 14:31:21+08:00:

Your previous post was removed because it was explicitly soliciting for help with homework, which is, to put it simply, a bit ethically dubious.

### 873: [How did New Age and offshoot movement become so obsessed with (often pseudo-)“Native American” culture?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y18gn7/how_did_new_age_and_offshoot_movement_become_so/), submitted on 2022-10-11 21:00:03+08:00.

Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, we have had to remove it due to violations of [subreddit’s rules about answers needing to reflect current scholarship](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_answers). While we appreciate the effort you have put into this comment, there are nevertheless significant errors, misunderstandings, or omissions of the topic at hand [which necessitated its removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/). 
 
We understand this can be discouraging, but we would also encourage you to consult [this Rules Roundtable to better understand how the mod team evaluates answers on the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/). If you are interested in feedback on improving future contributions, please feel free to [reach out to us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians&subject=Inquiry%20About%20Improving%20Future%20Responses).
