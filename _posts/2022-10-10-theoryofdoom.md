This comment was reported.  While it's wrong, I'm going to leave it up for instructive purposes.  

There are legal reasons why lawsuits associated with vaccine injury [almost certainly will not happen](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html).  Folks who are interested can read up on why, but [this is a slightly more detailed explanation](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2030600).  Here's another [resource](https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/faq), too. 

A nurse administering a vaccine wouldn't be liable for administering a vaccine (or drug product, in general) absent his/her individual negligence.  An entity, such as Walgreens, employing such an individual, would likewise not face liability in the absence of its negligence (such as failure to properly instruct employees on how to administer vaccines). 

About the only way the manufacturers could be liable is if they engaged in provable fraud before the FDA.  And that's an incredibly hard thing to prove.

### 412: [unpopular opinion strawberry milk is better than chocolate milk](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/y5h649/unpopular_opinion_strawberry_milk_is_better_than/), submitted on 2022-10-16 21:43:18+08:00.

Unpopular opinion: milk as such is gross.
