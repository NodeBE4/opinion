China's new restrictions on Australian imports have made headlines in the West this week. But curiously, beyond very limited coverage in the Global Times that is getting global attention, all is mostly silent inside China. What does this tell us? <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/11/06/chinas-silent-trade-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/11/06/chinas-silent-trade-row/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmJqTIhW0Ac9dKN?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
