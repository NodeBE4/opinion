### 357: [Worldnews permanently banned me because I agreed with a title basically](https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditCensorship/comments/xnxy8c/worldnews_permanently_banned_me_because_i_agreed/), submitted on 2022-09-26 04:21:58+08:00.

That you were permanently banned is not surprising.  /r/worldnews is moderated by a group of individuals who reflexively use their positions of supposed "influence" to cultivate and enforce an information ecosystem that reflects their desired "consensus reality."  

Many moderators on subreddits like /r/worldnews (including to to the extent there is overlap between that subreddit and others, like /r/geopolitics) view their role as one of "public service."  Many believe they have not only the right, but the responsibility to ensure that only the "correct" ideas are "platformed."  Anything else is a "threat" to the "safety" of other users.  Those folks do not view what they are doing as "censorship" or "silencing dissent," so much as "countering misinformation" or curtailing supposed "fake news."  

For example, one such /r/worldnews moderator is affiliated with Bellingcat and purports to be an "instructor" at Portland State University where this person purportedly obtained a PhD in geography.  As some part of his "academic research," this person focuses on so-called "fascist creep."  Significantly, this person has no background, academic or otherwise, in political theory whatsoever.  Yet, according to this person, it is enough that this person alone subjectively perceives your views to align with the so-called "alt right," for you to be precisely such a "threat" to "civility" or "safety."  This individual has routinely banned numerous members for expressing views this person unilaterally has determined to be "bigoted."  So-called "bigotry," of course, is measured by agreement with this person's political values.   After all, if this person perceives that you hold inappropriate views, according to this person you are an active threat and must be dispatched. 

There is much more to say about this same individual, but what is most striking to me is this person's incredible deficits in self awareness.  When this person bans people who express views this person disagrees with, doing so is promoting "safety."  Or at least upholding "civility."  But there is no extent of misconduct that would prompt this person to ban someone whose views do not intrude upon the consensus reality this person has endeavored to cultivate.  To the extent anyone who aligns with this person's views engages in objective misconduct and is banned by someone else, this person interprets that ban as an act of "bias" that is necessarily "politically motivated."  

I am speaking from my own observations of this individual's moderation behaviour on another subreddit over almost two years. 

tl;dr on /r/worldnews, the moderation standard is simple: "for my friends, anything; for my enemies, the law"

### 359: [How does russian media handle the gasleak, what is said to be the cause of it?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/xplza6/how_does_russian_media_handle_the_gasleak_what_is/), submitted on 2022-09-28 00:48:53+08:00.

> It was predicted in an analytical article dated 03/31/2020: 'Russian underwater gas pipelines will be destroyed'

A rare occasion where someone is bold enough to say what everyone was thinking.

The guys I go for do not look like me.  They're less muscular, less darkly tanned and usually shorter than me.  This makes me the minority?

### 361: [Kid destroys neighbors stuff then gets arrested later](https://old.reddit.com/r/donthelpjustfilm/comments/xs5emt/kid_destroys_neighbors_stuff_then_gets_arrested/), submitted on 2022-10-01 00:14:26+08:00.

> Parents may not even be home, left the kid alone.

Normal kids raised by normal parents do not do that shit when left alone.  

This is what fucked up kids raised by fucked up parents do when they are left alone.

I feel that.

> I think one assumption we can make is that whoever was supposed to be responsible for the supervision of this child demon did not do their job lol.

Any kid who needs to be supervised so he doesn't go off and throw rocks at the neighbor's car has a lot more problems than lack of supervision.
