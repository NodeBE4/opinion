> We can get special hats to let people know we're sick.

[Those already exist](https://www.trumpstore.com/products/classic-maga-hat/).

### 358: [How does russian media handle the gasleak, what is said to be the cause of it?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/xplza6/how_does_russian_media_handle_the_gasleak_what_is/), submitted on 2022-09-28 00:48:53+08:00.

> It was predicted in an analytical article dated 03/31/2020: 'Russian underwater gas pipelines will be destroyed'

A rare occasion where someone is bold enough to say what everyone was thinking.

### 359: [il keep the beer belly](https://old.reddit.com/r/SuddenlyGay/comments/xr3oy9/il_keep_the_beer_belly/), submitted on 2022-09-29 17:57:25+08:00.

----- __359.1__ -----2022-09-30 12:10:45+08:00:

The guys I go for do not look like me.  They're less muscular, less darkly tanned and usually shorter than me.  This makes me the minority?

### 360: [Kid destroys neighbors stuff then gets arrested later](https://old.reddit.com/r/donthelpjustfilm/comments/xs5emt/kid_destroys_neighbors_stuff_then_gets_arrested/), submitted on 2022-10-01 00:14:26+08:00.

> Parents may not even be home, left the kid alone.

Normal kids raised by normal parents do not do that shit when left alone.  

This is what fucked up kids raised by fucked up parents do when they are left alone.

----- __360.2__ -----2022-10-01 11:59:13+08:00:

> As a GenX kid, I feel attacked. 

I feel that.

----- __360.3__ -----2022-10-01 12:05:04+08:00:

> I think one assumption we can make is that whoever was supposed to be responsible for the supervision of this child demon did not do their job lol.

Any kid who needs to be supervised so he doesn't go off and throw rocks at the neighbor's car has a lot more problems than lack of supervision.
