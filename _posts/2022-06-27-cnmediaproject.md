The top piece right of the masthead in today's People's Daily reviews "collective study" in the CCP under Xi. But the point is to raise Xi's ideas. Lot's of signaling language. Xi's banner term as "contemporary Chinese Marxism, 21st century Marxism." He is the great theoretician.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWN9RlgaAAAU_kC?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Note the language about the "leadership core" being of "vital importance" 一个国家、一个政党，领导核心至关重要. With reference, mind you, to the helmsman: "The ship is heavy, with one man at the helm." 船重千钧，掌舵一人.

Re But note also the "core essential" 核心要义 of Xi Jinping's banner term itself, not just the man.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWOBeyhaAAEYmSX?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

With July 1 around the corner, the People's Daily lays it on thick with good feeling about Hong Kong. A piece about HK school kids singing "Me and My Mother Country," and Yan Jianguo (颜建国), CEO of China Overseas Land and Investment Ltd., kissing up. <a href="https://hkiod.com/document/DYA/2019/03_YanJianguo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hkiod.com/document/DYA/2019/03_YanJianguo.pdf</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWOEVe6aQAALvoE?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Support for Xi is crucial for CCP officials ahead of the 20th Congress. But aspects of the theory framework supporting him must be praised too. Page 11 has a tribute on "Xi Thought" on rule of law, by Li Ciqiang of East China Univ. of Pol.
