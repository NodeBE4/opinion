While coverage of the Ukraine war in China's official state media has emphasized a number of limited Party-state frames, other Chinese media have worked to tell more human and nuanced stories about the unfolding humanitarian crisis. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/22/human-stories-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/22/human-stories-of-war/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FObdIOVaAAY89S3?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Coverage of the tragic crash this week of China Eastern Airlines flight MU5735 has relied chiefly on information from state media focussing on the government response.
