### 1070: [What pop history book has done the most damage to the study of your particular subfield?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10iunfq/what_pop_history_book_has_done_the_most_damage_to/), submitted on 2023-01-23 05:22:51+08:00.

Unfortunately, that kind of grand comparative history doesn't really exist, at least in the wider historiographical consciousness. The 'Great Divergence' in economic productivity, as it is sometimes called, is essentially purely one of Europe vs the Middle East, East Asia, and South Asia; Central Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas are all considered peripheral to that. The irony, of course, is that surely the 'Greater' divergence would therefore be that between Eurasia and the rest of the world, before Eurasia itself bifurcated into a more 'dynamic' West and more 'stagnant' East, but, well...

So what you end up with is that a lot of the *good* comparative history doesn't attempt to answer your question, whereas what *does* try to answer your question – at least, from the broader, systematic perspective of why there were emerging divergences in economic power, military technology, organising capacity, and such – tends to be bad. There's a few exceptions of course, and I'd recommend, as one option, James Belich's recent book *The World the Plague Made*, albeit as a *perspective* rather than as a definitive statement. There are some economic historians who take umbrage with his numbers, and his argument also rests on the not-uncontroversial position that the evidence for the Black Death in China and India is relatively tenuous. I will also note a personal bias in that he's one of my professors. But, that all being said, it is at least an attempt at the 'Why Europe' question in grand geographical and chronological scope that comes from someone with a background in the historical method.
