### 1070: [What pop history book has done the most damage to the study of your particular subfield?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10iunfq/what_pop_history_book_has_done_the_most_damage_to/), submitted on 2023-01-23 05:22:51+08:00.

Unfortunately, that kind of grand comparative history doesn't really exist, at least in the wider historiographical consciousness. The 'Great Divergence' in economic productivity, as it is sometimes called, is essentially purely one of Europe vs the Middle East, East Asia, and South Asia; Central Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas are all considered peripheral to that. The irony, of course, is that surely the 'Greater' divergence would therefore be that between Eurasia and the rest of the world, before Eurasia itself bifurcated into a more 'dynamic' West and more 'stagnant' East, but, well...

So what you end up with is that a lot of the *good* comparative history doesn't attempt to answer your question, whereas what *does* try to answer your question – at least, from the broader, systematic perspective of why there were emerging divergences in economic power, military technology, organising capacity, and such – tends to be bad. There's a few exceptions of course, and I'd recommend, as one option, James Belich's recent book *The World the Plague Made*, albeit as a *perspective* rather than as a definitive statement. There are some economic historians who take umbrage with his numbers, and his argument also rests on the not-uncontroversial position that the evidence for the Black Death in China and India is relatively tenuous. I will also note a personal bias in that he's one of my professors. But, that all being said, it is at least an attempt at the 'Why Europe' question in grand geographical and chronological scope that comes from someone with a background in the historical method.

I wonder if you're misapprehending /u/Ramses_IV's point here, which is not that popular history deserves no credit, but rather that it is not creditable for an author or work to *only* draw attention to a topic if its presentation of that topic is flawed and if the most obvious follow-ups are as well. It's not that people shouldn't write biographies of Charlemagne for a popular audience; rather it's that people shouldn't get credit *for* writing them for a popular audience, people should get credit for them being *good history*.

Stephen Platt's *Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom*, hands-down. It's meticulously researched, extremely well-written, and historiographically innovative. If I were to be asked what one book to read on the Taiping, this would be it. Now, its coverage is decidedly incomplete. It does not cover the leadup to the uprising in the 1840s, nor its first nine years or so from 1851-59. What it does do is narrate, in meticulous detail, the last five years of the Taiping War, in which the Taiping sought to gain control of Shanghai while as Qing gradually pushed downriver along the Yangtze towards their capital at Nanjing. The key thing is it is fundamentally a connected history. The resurgence of the Taiping in 1860 is placed in a context with the concluding phases of the Qing defeat in the Arrow War against Britain and France; the British decision to tacitly, and later actively, support the Qing is considered in conjunction with British approaches to 'neutrality' in the concurrent American Civil War. The Taiping can often be trivialised as a curiosity of Chinese history, but Platt manages to reframe it as a key event of *global* history.

It's popular in the sense of being intended for a general rather than a narrowly academic audience. It's published by a trade press, it has a narrative format, it uses end- rather than footnotes (though that's not uncommon in academic press books either), and so on. It just happens to also be written by an academic and provide a fresh perspective that enhances our academic understanding.

I would consider it to be popular history written by an academic, yes. My benchmark is not to do with provenance but rather to do with intended audience: generally speaking, a narrative history published via a trade press is going to be intended to be both affordable and approachable to the general public in a way that an analytical history via an academic press will not.
