My advice to organizations with BNO fundings: you SHOULD NOT outreach to Chinese Embassy or relevant institutions to promote your courses or events. <br>Hongkongers have no trust in these orgs. Instead, the best way is to approach local Hongkonger social media groups or platforms.

Re But the lesson is that signs of totalitarianism were present in Hong Kong long before authorities instilled the draconian national security law in 2020. Law argues that those signs exist around the world, and therefore freedom shouldn’t be taken for granted in any country. ...

Re With democratic ideals such as press freedom and the rule of law being increasingly eroded in nations including Hungary, Brazil and Turkey – and with election results still being called into question in the US – Law offers a warning and a wake-up call.//
