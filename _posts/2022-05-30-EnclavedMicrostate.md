### 479: [With all the talk of the 2nd Amendment and its intent, can you cite either a regime that was repulsed by a well armed general population, or a regime that may not have come to power if there had been a well armed general population?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v0f9gn/with_all_the_talk_of_the_2nd_amendment_and_its/), submitted on 2022-05-30 00:51:12+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or [moralizing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/) it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.
