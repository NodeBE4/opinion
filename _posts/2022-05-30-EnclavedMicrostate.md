### 480: [With all the talk of the 2nd Amendment and its intent, can you cite either a regime that was repulsed by a well armed general population, or a regime that may not have come to power if there had been a well armed general population?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v0f9gn/with_all_the_talk_of_the_2nd_amendment_and_its/), submitted on 2022-05-30 00:51:12+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or [moralizing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/) it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.

### 481: [I'm a new civil servant in the Chinese Imperial government. How do I figure out what it is I will be doing?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v0hhao/im_a_new_civil_servant_in_the_chinese_imperial/), submitted on 2022-05-30 02:40:18+08:00.

----- __481.1__ -----2022-05-30 17:32:00+08:00:

You've covered a lot of material here, although one item that I'd wished you'd gone into more detail on was on the appointment process for those who had entered the civil service through examinations. This is something that's always been somewhat murky to me, as from what I know positions at the provincial and viceroyalty level were assigned by lot by the Board of Civil Appointments, but I have never found if more junior magistracies – not to mention appointments to the Six Boards – were also handled this way. Would you be able to offer any insights on that?

----- __481.2__ -----2022-05-31 00:02:02+08:00:

I had begun a bit of an answer before /u/SettingCool8239 posted theirs, but hit a bit of a snag in that I was having trouble getting good, hard information on the appointment methods used, specifically under the Qing which is my period of speciality. Since then I've managed to dig up some material that goes into more detail – as well as find detail in some works that I'd already known about – and so this answer is largely a small supplement to that focussing solely on the matter of selections for appointment.

In theory, nearly all appointments to official positions were done by lot, except at the very highest levels: when vacancies opened up, one would be assigned to them at random by the Board of Civil Appointments (aka the Ministry of Personnel). So, if you were considered capable enough out of your exams to qualify as an upper-seventh rank, you might find yourself assigned as the magistrate for one of the 1300 counties of China Proper, or in some form of auxiliary role at an imperial academy. If you received a higher or lower rank out of your exams, then the possible posts would again be concomitant to that rank. This, at least, was the theory. In practice, the randomness of the process was somewhat compromised by a few additional complications.

The first was office-selling, which was intermittent throughout the first century and a half of Qing rule in China but became firmly entrenched from the Taiping War (1851-64) onward. We ought to be clear here that office-selling didn't mean that specific postings were sold directly and that you could immediately buy your way into the magistracy of a particular county or a secretarial position at a particular board. Rather, you could purchase a scholarly degree *qualifying* you for a certain level of posting, and you could in turn buy yourself a higher level of consideration for a specific post – or in other words a place further up the queue – for when your number came up for appointment. This could reach theoretically absurd extremes, such as was the case for Wu Gongliang, who was listed in 1798 as the holder of a *gongsheng* 貢生 degree and under consideration for a position as a sub-prefectural magistrate for the capital prefecture. Wu Gongliang was three years old, his degree and theoretical candidacy for the magistracy having been purchased by his father Wu Jing, then acting governor of Henan Province, with the expected return on investment to come literally decades down the line. While purchasing candidacy for a specific office did not guarantee your holding it, it nevertheless put your foot in the door with the bureaucracy writ large and significantly heightened your chances of holding a post at or near the rank of the one you had bought a place for. For instance, if you bought a position as a salt intendant, you'd be near-guaranteed a salt intendancy (of which there were only six and all at defined locations), while buying a post as a county magistrate could end up sending you anywhere. Positions up to and including the rank of circuit intendant, therefore, were not necessarily solely obtained by merit as conventionally recognised, but rather a competitive process weighted in favour of those who had bought preferential consideration.

The second was exemptions for high-priority counties. During the Kangxi reign (1661-1722), there had been some recognition that pure sortition might put a sub-par official in charge of a highly sensitive post, and as such governors were allowed to request special dispensation to hand-pick new appointees to specific counties; in addition, counties were rated on a four-letter scale from most to least sensitive. Counties on rivers and the coastline were most likely to be given such consideration, as the threat of piracy and banditry, as well as these counties' position along commercial highways, made their administration especially important. The Kangxi-era measures were, however, rather clunky, and even as Qing rule stabilised, problems with individual counties when it came to administrative workload and political sensitivity never really went away. The priority county system would be introduced under the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722-35), with an initial, not-entirely-formal designation of riverine and coastal counties as permanently exempted from the appointment lottery, followed by a more comprehensive reform in 1728 proposed by Jin Hong, then the provincial judge for Guangxi and with a temporary appointment as an imperial commissioner for administrative affairs. Per Daniel Koss, Jin Hong's system, which was finally implemented in 1732, saw the four-letter system superseded by a more specific set of tags, where counties could have any number (including, in most cases, none) of the following designations: *chong* 衝 'thoroughfares', which were located on major land or water routes; *fan* 繁 'complex', where there were complicated administrative considerations; *pi* 疲 'tiresome', where taxes were often in arrears; and *nan* 難 'difficult', 'where the population is wicked, where customs are violent and where cases of theft are numerous'. At the same time, the old river and coastal tags remained in use. Appointments to the magistracies of any county that had at least three problem tags, or a river or coastal one, remained at the discretion of the provincial governor, which again limited the full extent of the lot-based appointment method.

The third was preferential appointment of Bannermen, especially Manchus, principally during the Qianlong reign (1735-96). Ethnic bias was, to be sure, more acute when it came to promotions (which ultimately saw Manchus promoted at a higher rate than Han officials) than appointments, but there were ways in which Manchu preferentialism did affect the direct appointment process. Firstly, the Six Boards had specific ethnic quotas for Han and Banner populations, and with the latter being considerably more numerous than the latter, that meant that competition for such posts was considerably greater among Han aspirants than among Bannermen. Secondly, at the provincial level, a certain level of preferential appointment of Manchus also took place, especially under the Qianlong Emperor, who on average appointed five Manchus to governorships for every four Han; at one stage all eight viceroys (who served either as governors of particularly important provinces, or as supervisors of two or three ordinarily-governed provinces) were Manchus. During the later Kangxi reign and much of the Yongzheng reign, Manchus did not hold county and prefectural appointments at a particularly disproportionate rate – or at least not what could be perceived as one – but some Han officials remarked with increasing perturbation upon what seemed a sudden increase in Manchu appointments to local office from the 1740s onward. So one might also find one's access to official appointment to be influenced heavily by one's ethnic background.

In short, there was theory, and there was practice, and the supposed meritocracy of the Qing was not all that it appeared to be.

In practical terms, the Qing are the only imperial state whose archives still exist in relatively complete form. It had been traditional, after the completion of an official history by a later state, to destroy the archives on which that history was based, and so the surviving materials for any pre-Qing state largely do not consist of archival sources in the conventional sense. Historical writings, both state-sponsored and private, as well as simply whatever other sources from the periods in question survive, serve as the basis for any kind of serious writing. The Qing situation is different because there is a surviving state archive as nobody destroyed it, but it is essentially split in half between Taipei and Beijing. The Manchu archive in particular is located almost entirely at the latter.

As I'm not a professional in this field I don't have particularly good knowledge on archival accessibility, especially in Beijing, but it's the sort of thing that can go back and forth. Scholars often aren't necessarily barred from access, although I believe large sections of the Manchu archive in Beijing have been cut off for a while in order to produce a compilation of translated Chinese editions. This is compounded by my principal area of focus, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, being one which can require essentially no archival work depending on one's focus, as the majority of the kingdom's own documentary output has long been compiled into edited compendia along with key works on the Qing side, while European published sources are easily accessible via the public domain.

### 485: [What actually happened to Hololive Alternative?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/v0qqyt/what_actually_happened_to_hololive_alternative/), submitted on 2022-05-30 11:04:15+08:00.

----- __485.1__ -----2022-05-30 11:14:04+08:00:

You can find the roadmap here: https://alt.hololive.tv/news/203/

Basically HoloAlt consists of four sub-projects: 

* HoloEarth, whose (pre?)alpha test happened a month or two back;

* The manga series, of which the Fubuki and Mio-centered series [is being made](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-05-06/goblin-slayer-manga-artist-launches-hololive-virtual-youtuber-fantasy-manga/.185394) though I don't recall if it's just that the translations haven't gone up or if the original Japanese version is still in production;

* Holonometria which is basically a lore site tied in with the manga and wider HoloAlt;

* The PV from 2021 and one that was slated for this spring but might be delayed.

With the manga, unfortunately there was some disagreement that led to the artist for what would have been a Marine manga quitting, and that seems to have been cancelled outright. As for the other, titled 'Underworld Academy Overload', unfortunately there's been no news there to my knowledge.

----- __485.2__ -----2022-05-30 20:15:19+08:00:

Ah, I'd seen an earlier announcement where it said they'd also be hosted on Holonometria, which they don't *seem* to be as far as I can tell, so good catch!

Hang on I did a quick check, and per discussion in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/up5alq/where_can_i_read_the_holoalt_manga_i_know_its_up/i8isxne/) Chapter 2 is up in JP, but the reader on Holonometria wasn't finished in time for EN and ID versions.

----- __489.1__ -----2022-06-01 00:50:52+08:00:

As a moderator of r/AskHistorians, I believe I speak for everyone on the team when I say that the most tedious aspect of modding this particular sub is dealing with variations on 'where are the comments?' This, ironically, is without a doubt the most frequently asked question on the subreddit.

Because we remove a very high proportion of submitted comments (as a general rule, the only things that stay up are adequate attempts at answering the question), there is almost always a mismatch between the comment count and the actual comments displayed – sometimes dozens or even hundreds – which almost always ends up being met with either indignation or confusion. On some high-activity threads, the *majority* of comments (which themselves have to be removed) are asking where the comments are, and I do not exaggerate when I say we get almost daily modmails asking about why the comment count doesn't correspond to the actual number of visible comments on a given question or just in general. This reached a stage where one enterprising user voluntarily created a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that added a count of non-removed, non-distinguished comments in brackets next to the displayed count for anyone who wanted it, but the limitation is of course you wouldn't have that running before you came across the sub.

To put it in brief, the comment count mismatch has been one of the longest-running issues with running the sub as it very easily trips up new users who expect to see considerably more content than is actually present and then inadvertently contribute to the problem, and changing it to show the number of actually visible comments would help a lot with that issue.
