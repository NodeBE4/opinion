### 480: [With all the talk of the 2nd Amendment and its intent, can you cite either a regime that was repulsed by a well armed general population, or a regime that may not have come to power if there had been a well armed general population?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v0f9gn/with_all_the_talk_of_the_2nd_amendment_and_its/), submitted on 2022-05-30 00:51:12+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or [moralizing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/) it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.

### 481: [I'm a new civil servant in the Chinese Imperial government. How do I figure out what it is I will be doing?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v0hhao/im_a_new_civil_servant_in_the_chinese_imperial/), submitted on 2022-05-30 02:40:18+08:00.

You've covered a lot of material here, although one item that I'd wished you'd gone into more detail on was on the appointment process for those who had entered the civil service through examinations. This is something that's always been somewhat murky to me, as from what I know positions at the provincial and viceroyalty level were assigned by lot by the Board of Civil Appointments, but I have never found if more junior magistracies – not to mention appointments to the Six Boards – were also handled this way. Would you be able to offer any insights on that?

### 482: [That last step...](https://old.reddit.com/r/DiWHY/comments/v0mifh/that_last_step/), submitted on 2022-05-30 06:54:52+08:00.

### 483: [How do you think todays capital cities such as Washington, Berlin, Paris, and London will be seen in thousands of years by future generations after the countries will eventually collapse? Do you think they will be treated similar to how Rome or Constantinople are treated today?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v0qhj0/how_do_you_think_todays_capital_cities_such_as/), submitted on 2022-05-30 10:48:10+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).

### 484: [what does the term Freebooters mean?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v0qkye/what_does_the_term_freebooters_mean/), submitted on 2022-05-30 10:54:08+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 485: [What actually happened to Hololive Alternative?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/v0qqyt/what_actually_happened_to_hololive_alternative/), submitted on 2022-05-30 11:04:15+08:00.

----- __485.1__ -----2022-05-30 11:14:04+08:00:

You can find the roadmap here: https://alt.hololive.tv/news/203/

Basically HoloAlt consists of four sub-projects: 

* HoloEarth, whose (pre?)alpha test happened a month or two back;

* The manga series, of which the Fubuki and Mio-centered series [is being made](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2022-05-06/goblin-slayer-manga-artist-launches-hololive-virtual-youtuber-fantasy-manga/.185394) though I don't recall if it's just that the translations haven't gone up or if the original Japanese version is still in production;

* Holonometria which is basically a lore site tied in with the manga and wider HoloAlt;

* The PV from 2021 and one that was slated for this spring but might be delayed.

With the manga, unfortunately there was some disagreement that led to the artist for what would have been a Marine manga quitting, and that seems to have been cancelled outright. As for the other, titled 'Underworld Academy Overload', unfortunately there's been no news there to my knowledge.

### 486: [Renee Picard's Role in Uniting Earth and the Federation](https://old.reddit.com/r/startrekpicard/comments/v0wna9/renee_picards_role_in_uniting_earth_and_the/), submitted on 2022-05-30 17:48:40+08:00.

It'd take several years to get to Jupiter and back; depending on how quickly WW3 happened the mission might have returned after the nuclear exchange.
