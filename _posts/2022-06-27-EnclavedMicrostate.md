### 576: [In the Arabic language, the words "West" and "strange" share the same root. Is there a deeper meaning behind this? Did Arabs associate the West with Otherness? Did they define themselves as being "of the East", in the same way the West does now?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vlwtx2/in_the_arabic_language_the_words_west_and_strange/), submitted on 2022-06-27 22:30:40+08:00.

So I need to bring up a few corrections here and also draw /u/Abu_Darwish's attention to them:

> In Chinese, or at least in Hunanese (which I shit you not sounded identical to German), you can't have adjectives that aren't directly attached to nouns

You can have adjectives without nouns, largely because in Sinitic languages terms can often be nouns, adjectives, or verbs depending on context. But for instance the term 快 *kuai* 'fast' is *only* an adjective, and its use in isolation is perfectly cromulent. For instance I could simply translate 'fast and furious' as 又快又怒 *you kuai you nu* and it would be entirely acceptable.

> Friendly FYI, Mandarin should be called "Pu Tong Hua", meaning the common peoples' language, that's what they call it.

The use of the term 'Putonghua' is not universal and is really mainly the standard in Mainland China. On Taiwan, the term preferred is *Guoyu* ('national language'), and *Huayu* ('Hua language') in Southeast Asia. 'Mandarin' has been the standard in English in both colloquial and academic contexts for decades, and there is no more case for demanding a switch from 'Mandarin' to 'Putonghua' then there would be for switching from 'German' to 'Deutsch' or 'Japanese' to 'Nihongo'.

> It's specifically the official governmental language, the same way what we call French is really the Parisian language.

Not entirely. There is a Standard Chinese derived from Mandarin, but from a linguistics standpoint, Mandarin is the largest of the Sinitic dialect/language subgroups and encompasses a number of regional varieties as well such as ~~Hunanese and~~ (EDIT: Nope, I made a mistake) Sichuanese. Its association with the governmental language is due to modern Standard Chinese and Early Modern *Guanhua* ('court language') being rooted in the Beijing dialect of Mandarin.

> It has its own storied history, because it's originally the language of the Manchu, who conquered Beijing from the north and created the Qing

No, the Manchus spoke the Tungusic language of Manchu. Beijing Mandarin had been established as the standard for *Guanhua* since the late Ming. You may be getting confused because under the Qing, *Guoyu* (the term used for Mandarin on Taiwan) was used for Manchu instead because it was the (nominal) language of the state.

> "Mandarin" (because that's the British colonizer's word for the Manchu scholar class)

'Mandarin' was applied to the scholar-bureaucrats as a whole, not the Manchus more broadly (the two were only partially intersecting).

> Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems your perspective comes from a Taiwanese origin?

I'm from Hong Kong actually, but my perspective is broadly rooted in Anglophone academia in this case, which has consistently used 'Mandarin' over 'Putonghua' and continues to.

> As far as Mandarin encompassing Hunanese, idk.

Ack, you're right – I'd forgotten that Hunanese is a variety of Xiang and not of Mandarin; it's Hu*bei* that's a Mandarin region.

> It's anecdotal and the source is "trust me" but I was told to call it Putonghua in English.

Cool. As a part-Chinese person, 'Putonghua' is only used in certain contexts, primarily relating to Mainland China, and Mainland China does not have a monopoly on Sinitic languages.

----- __577.1__ -----2022-06-28 00:55:14+08:00:

Yes. This is a weekly megathread where general discussion goes.

----- __577.2__ -----2022-06-28 00:58:20+08:00:

...relating to what? All I see in the comments is about Calli's sister being a little, er, inconsiderate.

----- __577.3__ -----2022-06-28 02:38:48+08:00:

Yes.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?"
