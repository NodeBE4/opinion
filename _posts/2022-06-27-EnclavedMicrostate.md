### 576: [In the Arabic language, the words "West" and "strange" share the same root. Is there a deeper meaning behind this? Did Arabs associate the West with Otherness? Did they define themselves as being "of the East", in the same way the West does now?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vlwtx2/in_the_arabic_language_the_words_west_and_strange/), submitted on 2022-06-27 22:30:40+08:00.

So I need to bring up a few corrections here and also draw /u/Abu_Darwish's attention to them:

> In Chinese, or at least in Hunanese (which I shit you not sounded identical to German), you can't have adjectives that aren't directly attached to nouns

You can have adjectives without nouns, largely because in Sinitic languages terms can often be nouns, adjectives, or verbs depending on context. But for instance the term 快 *kuai* 'fast' is *only* an adjective, and its use in isolation is perfectly cromulent. For instance I could simply translate 'fast and furious' as 又快又怒 *you kuai you nu* and it would be entirely acceptable.

> Friendly FYI, Mandarin should be called "Pu Tong Hua", meaning the common peoples' language, that's what they call it.

The use of the term 'Putonghua' is not universal and is really mainly the standard in Mainland China. On Taiwan, the term preferred is *Guoyu* ('national language'), and *Huayu* ('Hua language') in Southeast Asia. 'Mandarin' has been the standard in English in both colloquial and academic contexts for decades, and there is no more case for demanding a switch from 'Mandarin' to 'Putonghua' then there would be for switching from 'German' to 'Deutsch' or 'Japanese' to 'Nihongo'.

> It's specifically the official governmental language, the same way what we call French is really the Parisian language.

Not entirely. There is a Standard Chinese derived from Mandarin, but from a linguistics standpoint, Mandarin is the largest of the Sinitic dialect/language subgroups and encompasses a number of regional varieties as well such as ~~Hunanese and~~ (EDIT: Nope, I made a mistake) Sichuanese. Its association with the governmental language is due to modern Standard Chinese and Early Modern *Guanhua* ('court language') being rooted in the Beijing dialect of Mandarin.

> It has its own storied history, because it's originally the language of the Manchu, who conquered Beijing from the north and created the Qing

No, the Manchus spoke the Tungusic language of Manchu. Beijing Mandarin had been established as the standard for *Guanhua* since the late Ming. You may be getting confused because under the Qing, *Guoyu* (the term used for Mandarin on Taiwan) was used for Manchu instead because it was the (nominal) language of the state.

> "Mandarin" (because that's the British colonizer's word for the Manchu scholar class)

'Mandarin' was applied to the scholar-bureaucrats as a whole, not the Manchus more broadly (the two were only partially intersecting).

> Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems your perspective comes from a Taiwanese origin?

I'm from Hong Kong actually, but my perspective is broadly rooted in Anglophone academia in this case, which has consistently used 'Mandarin' over 'Putonghua' and continues to.

> As far as Mandarin encompassing Hunanese, idk.

Ack, you're right – I'd forgotten that Hunanese is a variety of Xiang and not of Mandarin; it's Hu*bei* that's a Mandarin region.

> It's anecdotal and the source is "trust me" but I was told to call it Putonghua in English.

Cool. As a part-Chinese person, 'Putonghua' is only used in certain contexts, primarily relating to Mainland China, and Mainland China does not have a monopoly on Sinitic languages.

Yes.

### 579: [[manchu - english]](https://old.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/vn4dee/manchu_english/), submitted on 2022-06-29 10:17:07+08:00.

----- __579.1__ -----2022-06-29 22:31:03+08:00:

This looks like some kind of bizarre propaganda for... some kind of weird nationalist movement. But there is some legible text so here goes. I won't bother with full translations everywhere, especially in the case of the top right text which is only partial and where I got the gist pretty fast. Each section has the Manchu script (legible to anyone with the appropriate fonts installed), the Romanisation (I use Norman rather than Abkai), and a literal word-for-word translation, followed by commentary.

Photo caption (cut off at the bottom):

> ᠠᠪᡴᠠ ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡴᠠᡵᠮᠠᠮᡝ ᠠᡳ[...]

> abka manju karmame ai[...]

> Heaven Manchu protect (converb form) [...]

Turns out, a quick Google of the phrase "abka manju karmame" reveals its origins as the phrase *abka manju karmame aisireo* ᠠᠪᡴᠠ ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡴᠠᡵᠮᠠᠮᡝ ᠠᡳᠰᡳᡵᡝᠣ, in literal terms 'Heaven Manchu protect bless', in more idiomatic terms 'may Heaven protect the Manchus'. However, as pointed out by [this Twitter user](https://twitter.com/slmngy001/status/673014906355113984?lang=en), this is not really proper Manchu, as it lacks the accusative particle *be* ᠪᡝ. The user does also claim that the phrase doubles up on terms that translate to the same Mandarin term for 'protect', although consulting Norman's dictionary, the two verbs do seem to be somewhat distinct, with *karmambi* being 'protect' or 'safeguard' while *aisimbi* is 'bless' or 'uphold'. If grammatically rendered as *abka manju be karmame aisireo* ᠠᠪᡴᠠ ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᠪᡝ ᡴᠠᡵᠮᠠᠮᡝ ᠠᡳᠰᡳᡵᡝᠣ, it would mean something along the lines of 'Heaven protectively bless the Manchus.'

Top right (also cut off at the bottom)

> ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ ᡝᠵᡝᠨ ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ ᡶᡝᠵᡝᡵᡤᡳ ᠨᡳᠶᠠ[]

> abkai ejen abkai fejergi niya[]

> Heaven (possessive) lord Heaven (possessive) under

The first line cuts at *niya* but is almost certainly *niyalma*, 'people', but there is no verb so I cannot give a direct translation of these five words beyond the existence of the phrases 'Lord of Heaven', '[all] under Heaven', and 'people'.

*However* Google saves the day. A quick search revealed that these five words are the first of John 3:16 in what seems to have been a late 19th century Manchu translation, which in full reads

> ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ ᡝᠵᡝᠨ ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ ᡶᡝᠵᡝᡵᡤᡳ ᠨᡳᠶᠠᠯᠮᠠ ᠪᡝ ᡤᠣᠰᡳᠮᡝ  
> ᡳᠨᡳ ᠪᠠᠨᠵᡳᡥᠠ ᡝᠮᡥᡠᡥ ᡨᡝᡳᠯᡝ ᠵᡠᡳ ᠪᡝ ᠴᡝᠨᡩᡝ ᠠᡶᠠᠪᡠᡥᠠᠩᡤᡝ

> Abkai ejen abkai fejergi niyalma be gosime,

> Of-Heaven lord of-Heaven of-under people (acc.) love,  
> He born alone alone son (acc.) them (dat.) entrust,  
> Especially him (dat.) believe every person perish instead of,  
> On the other hand eternal living obtain say,  
> This highest (poss.) love (emphatic particle).

Which to try to make idiomatic would be along the lines of:

> The Lord of Heaven loved the people under Heaven, [so]  
> He entrusted them his only begotten son,  
> So that every person who believed him, instead of perishing,  
> Will instead receive eternal life.
> This is the highest/greatest love.

Contrast NIV:

> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

Or KJV:

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

The final *ere ten i gosin kai* phrase seems to be an annotation to John 3:16 added in the text from which this clipping is drawn.

Bottom right:

> ᠵᡝᡤᡳᠶᠠᠩ ᡤᠣᠯᠣᡳ ᡩᠣᠣᠯᡳᡳ  ᡳ ᠪᡨᠠᡳᠠ ᠪᡝ ᠪᠠᡳᠴᠠᡵᠠ  
> ᠪᠠᡳᠴᠠᠮᡝ ᡨᠣᠣᡵᠠ ᡥᠠᡶᠠᠨ ᠪᠣᠣᠮᡳᠩ  ᡳ ᡤᡳᠩᡤᡠᠯᡝᠮᡝ ᠠᡵᠠᡥᠠᠩᡤᡝ  
> ᠠᠵᠯᠠᡶᡠᠨ

> jegiyang goloi dooli i baita be baicara

> jalafun

> Zhejiang province (poss.) circuit (poss.) matter (acc.) inspection  
> inspect (converb) ?? official ?Booming? he respectfully written
> long life

I'm not entirely sure on this, but it seems to be taken from the tail-end of some kind of administrative letter, written by an official named Booming (pronounced Baoming) declaring his involvement in some kind of inspection in a circuit of Zhejiang Province, and closing with wishing longevity upon the recipient. Unlike the other two texts I wasn't able to cross-reference my transliteration against an online one, so I can only assume this is some sort of archival document not otherwise digitised.
