A friend saw #Freedom in a New York bookstore.<br>It’s been a few months since its publication — feedbacks have been great, and I'm so grateful readers learned more about Hong Kong and the values of democracy.<br>It’s an entry book to Hong Kong movement and activism. Hope you enjoy it<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FX8MfHZWAAAosQK?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
