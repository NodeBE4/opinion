“For Hong Kong now the “one country, two systems” basically turned into “one country, one system,” and Hong Kong is becoming another ordinary Chinese city.”<br>“We’ve got all the understanding of how China is invading the society”<br><br>@GenevaSummit <a href="https://www.genevasummit.org/nathan-law-speaks-at-2021-geneva-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.genevasummit.org/nathan-law-speaks-at-2021-geneva-summit/</a>

We must realize how fragile our freedoms and democracies are, and protect them actively. We are not only the beneficiaries of democracy, but also the guardians of it.<br><br>#StandWithHongKong <br><br>@GenevaSummit<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1402029209506271238/pu/vid/1280x720/oOLUuXC1P7lF8Pkl.mp4?tag=12" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1402029209506271238/pu/img/T8eSo8sERzT7LETP.jpg"></video>

On this day two years ago, in 2019, more than a million people rallied on the streets of Hong Kong. <br>Many have been prosecuted, injured, jailed, and exiled.<br>Even though democracy has not prevailed, we believe that eventually it would, as long as we never give up.<br>#StandwithHK<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3cGsv7XoAYJ2a_?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Looking forward to seeing you all tonight! It's important for us to preserve the protest-related artworks that are no longer able to be screened in Hong Kong.<br>Honoured to share the platform with @aiww , @SKinnock , @finnlau_cd and many others.<br>#StandWithHongKong<br><br>Cinema for Peace Foundation: We are honoured to host The China Summit, on the June 9th in Church House Westminster, alongside with filmmaker and activist Ai WeiWei, and the IPAC, we will be foregrounding cultures that are facing endangerment at the actions of the mainland Chinese government<br><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3WqKVaXoAIxzXN?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Films need to be loyal to the CCP in Hong Kong. How ridiculous could the authority be?<br><br>Rebecca Davis: Huge: Hong Kong has just issued new amendments to its film censorship rules that effectively impose Beijing’s strict censorship standards there overnight, in the name of the National Security Law. They take effect today.<br>

Thanks @SKinnock! Always proud to have you standing with Hong Kong.<br><br>Stephen Kinnock: It was an honour for me to address #StandUpForHongKong rally today, on the 2nd anniversary of the 12.6.19 march - the largest in Hong Kong’s history. Beijing’s brutal crackdown in HK is a scar on the conscience of democracy. HK needs the free world, and the free world needs HK!<br><br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1403702586646085642/pu/vid/480x848/_pzRr__Xks3E3UXF.mp4?tag=12" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1403702586646085642/pu/img/CMtaL1PMebMWSfIR.jpg"></video>
