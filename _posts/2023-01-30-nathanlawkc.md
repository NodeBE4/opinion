In the past two years, more than 150k Hongkongers have relocated to the UK under the BNO visa scheme. I am proud of the Hong Kong community we've built in the UK.<br><br>Thank you so much to all of you who supported it —  espl. @SKinnock, @DanielKorski, @sundersays and @FelicityBuchan.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fn0667hWIAAYnO_?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re @SKinnock @DanielKorski @sundersays @FelicityBuchan The key to a good integration/immigration program is not only getting HKers to know about the UK society, but also making our community more visible and showing our uniqueness. Part of my work is to introduce our culture to the locals --  follow @HKFF_UK and @HKUC_UK for more.
