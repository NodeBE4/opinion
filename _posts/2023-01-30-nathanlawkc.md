In the past two years, more than 150k Hongkongers have relocated to the UK under the BNO visa scheme. I am proud of the Hong Kong community we've built in the UK.<br><br>Thank you so much to all of you who supported it —  espl. @SKinnock, @DanielKorski, @sundersays and @FelicityBuchan.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fn0667hWIAAYnO_?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re @SKinnock @DanielKorski @sundersays @FelicityBuchan The key to a good integration/immigration program is not only getting HKers to know about the UK society, but also making our community more visible and showing our uniqueness. Part of my work is to introduce our culture to the locals --  follow @HKFF_UK and @HKUC_UK for more.

“China is challenging the rest of the world about its ideology, about its global international system,” Law said. “It’s really important to keep raising awareness for political prisoners in Hong Kong, human rights violations in Hong Kong.” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/exiled-hong-kong-activist-nathan-law-says-bn-o-flight-to-uk-will-continue?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/exiled-hong-kong-activist-nathan-law-says-bn-o-flight-to-uk-will-continue?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter</a>

Cannot think of a better way to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine than producing a song -- one of the best Hong Kong music producers @AdriancpyChow wrote this fantastic piece.<br>Like and share it -- I hope one day we can hear it from a big stage. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOxsFk2mWfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOxsFk2mWfQ</a>

Really excited to share my view on @taniabranigan's new book #Redmemory. To understand modern China, one must start with the Cultural Revolution. There are so many parallels between Mao's ruling from Xi's era. <br>@ChathamHouse <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2023-02/review-cultural-revolution-still-haunts-china?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=twt-febmarch-2023-review-red-memory&amp;utm_content=twt-febmarch-2023-review-red-memory-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2023-02/review-cultural-revolution-still-haunts-china?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=twt-febmarch-2023-review-red-memory&amp;utm_content=twt-febmarch-2023-review-red-memory-content</a>
