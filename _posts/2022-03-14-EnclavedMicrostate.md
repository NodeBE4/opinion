### 221: [额 as a Royal Title?](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/tdiyzx/额_as_a_royal_title/), submitted on 2022-03-14 07:00:44+08:00.

To reiterate and expand on the other two comments, the Manchu ᡝᠨᠶᡝ *eniye* 'mother' was loaned into Beijing Mandarin as 額娘 *eniang*, but I cannot find examples of 額皇 in use anywhere; was this a misreading or mishearing on your part? Or is it there in the subtitles?

----- __221.2__ -----2022-03-14 08:42:48+08:00:

As I understand it, 朕 *zhen* as the first-person pronoun for emperors has been enshrined since the Qin, rather than being a specifically Manchu construction.

### 222: [If ernst rohm (The leader of the Nazi SA) were to survive until the Nuremberg Trials, what would he be convicted of?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tdoh6s/if_ernst_rohm_the_leader_of_the_nazi_sa_were_to/), submitted on 2022-03-14 11:53:14+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf.

### 223: [For those who can't see Calli in 3D this Sunday, don't worry! She's got some good stuff planned for everyone! Sasuga dad!](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tesd12/for_those_who_cant_see_calli_in_3d_this_sunday/), submitted on 2022-03-16 00:03:40+08:00.

----- __223.1__ -----2022-03-16 01:25:46+08:00:

So I think I have a rough idea as to what it might potentially be, based on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/moricalliope/status/1502351888536113152) from just a few days ago...

### 224: [Would Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China to alleviate poverty work in other impoverished or imperialized nations?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tf8y47/would_deng_xiaopings_reforms_in_china_to/), submitted on 2022-03-16 12:09:47+08:00.

### 225: [What are some of the most unexpected or strangest ISOLATED incidences where countries that are totally remote to each other seem to have greatly impacted each other culturally, politically, etc. without any obvious reason?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tg2igu/what_are_some_of_the_most_unexpected_or_strangest/), submitted on 2022-03-17 13:06:23+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.
