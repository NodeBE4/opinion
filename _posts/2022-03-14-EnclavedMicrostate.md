### 221: [额 as a Royal Title?](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/tdiyzx/额_as_a_royal_title/), submitted on 2022-03-14 07:00:44+08:00.

----- __221.1__ -----2022-03-14 08:36:30+08:00:

To reiterate and expand on the other two comments, the Manchu ᡝᠨᠶᡝ *eniye* 'mother' was loaned into Beijing Mandarin as 額娘 *eniang*, but I cannot find examples of 額皇 in use anywhere; was this a misreading or mishearing on your part? Or is it there in the subtitles?

----- __221.2__ -----2022-03-14 08:42:48+08:00:

As I understand it, 朕 *zhen* as the first-person pronoun for emperors has been enshrined since the Qin, rather than being a specifically Manchu construction.

### Sources:

Unfortunately there's not a lot of what might be considered 'good' sourcing on a lot of VTuber history. Most of it is in Japanese of course, and even if you're good at it you'll be reliant on people actually compiling sources. The [Virtual Youtuber Wiki](http://www.virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki) obviously has limitations but it's a good source for basic information and timelines; for more in-depth discussion including 'forbidden knowledge' (i.e. alternate and IRL identities) the subreddit /r/VirtualYoutubers has a lot of old threads on the topic, with the ones I consulted while writing this post listed here:

I think I need to declare here that despite a somewhat dispassionate tone in my post I am a bit of a Hololive fanatic, so apologies if my comments see me jumping more to the defence of the modern industry.

So, all told, the interval between Kizuna AI's debut and the introduction of iPhone X and face-only Live2D was barely a year, which was not a lot of time for the companies established in that time (Activ8 and COVER) to get that much in terms of revenues to fund a massive suite of new Live2D members. I'd argue it was entirely new companies, which were able to put all their startup funding into Live2D, that profited most from the switch – Nijisanji being the arch-example. EDIT: To put it another way, the iPhone X coming on the market completely reset the field because existing infrastructure couldn't be adapted to it, so anyone who was going into Live2D VTubing was starting from scratch in early 2018.

Thanks for the tip-off, I was using the wrong site's formatting (too used to Discord's these days)

----- __227.4__ -----2022-03-18 22:45:39+08:00:

I was going to say it's rather interesting how passionate you are about this topic, given that you [seem to have found out about Hitomi Chris entirely from my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/tgul39/friday_unjerk_thread/i15h2o8/?context=3). Especially as in said post I fully declare that information is hard to come by and narratives are conflicting over Chris' culpability, which makes it impossible to come to any kind of clear conclusion as to what exactly caused the firing. Nor did I attempt to insinuate that COVER hasn't made attempts to improve (all but the most diehard haters would agree it has). But then you deleted your account so uh... *shrug*.

----- __227.5__ -----2022-03-19 00:16:06+08:00:

> it also furthered the parasocial attachment the viewer has to the personality in a manner similar to the idol industry combined with the reverence for Japanese VAs.

What's quite interesting is that this may have been intended on Activ8's part. [This recent blog post](https://note.com/jmatsuda2501/n/nc323452afa3f) by J. Matsuda, one of Kizuna AI's principal creators, is a fascinating read even in machine translation (note: use DeepL rather than Google Translate for it if you want something actually readable), especially because of how he conceived of it precisely because of his parasocial relationships. In essence, for him the parasocial relationship would be a feature, not a bug, of the 'eternal idol', and something to very deliberately encourage. And that's something I find utterly fascinating precisely because of how at least on the conscious and/or public level, the parasocial aspect is something that VTubers and their fans today *generally* don't want to be seen as encouraging. Whether that's successful is a different question, but for me at least there has been an inversion from the original 'authorial intent' so to speak, where the parasocial side is indeed now seen as bug rather than feature.

> so despite all the inherent problems and toxicity the Vtuber fandom has, at least there's that layer of security and respect for the person behind the persona to fall back on.

To toss my own thought in on this, I think VTuber fandom is as toxic as any other in terms of extent, it's just toxic in specific ways that may not be familiar to people in most other fandoms. As this very sub illustrates, any fandom is fully capable of some pretty severe depths of bad behaviour and toxicity, but VTuber drama just manages to be very public and involve very specific dynamics that may seem alien to anyone not already part of the viewing community.

What can I say except *sunglasses emoji*

----- __227.7__ -----2022-03-19 00:47:20+08:00:

I am going to treat this lighthearted comment entirely seriously and note that, were it not for space issues as well as relevance, I did come close to including a paragraph on cases of *arguable* prototypical virtual youtubers like Annoying Orange, or review creators who use a set of still drawings of a cartoon representation of themselves depicting different reactions to add to their videos' visuals, with present-day examples including SaberSpark and TheMysteriousMrEnter, to name a few. I genuinely have no idea how old the latter format is; I can definitely think of Confused Matthew as being one of the older examples of the type but I presume he didn't come up with the whole 'cutting away to a reaction face on a representative cartoon character' schtick. And I think once you get to this stage, you just have to be very firm on the mocap aspect: none of these are performances that are rendered live and essentially ready for release, but rather created in the edit.

----- __227.8__ -----2022-03-19 01:10:53+08:00:

...*no*.

----- __227.9__ -----2022-03-19 01:13:07+08:00:

What's interesting is that Mito wasn't even the first Live2D VTuber (which I think goes to [Nem](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Nem)), just the first really successful one.

----- __227.10__ -----2022-03-19 01:14:34+08:00:

> It almost seems insulting to put her along side people who just record themselves talking about random nonsense with a virtual avatar.

As opposed to overtly insulting to the people 'talking about random nonsense with a virtual avatar'? I don't know that this is a particularly productive way of framing it. Ami Yamato isn't better or worse than modern VTubers, just different.

----- __227.11__ -----2022-03-19 01:17:02+08:00:

I think that'd be a really interesting thing to happen, but I feel like even then it's unlikely to be taken all that well. I can definitely imagine some kind of scenario with a family member taking over a channel in some way post-retirement, but taking over the character would be a little odd. But I suppose we shall see some years down the line, when 'ageing out' of a VTuber identity starts to be something that needs to be reckoned with.

----- __227.12__ -----2022-03-19 01:52:15+08:00:

As noted, the allegation is that he alleged to have connections with Cover management and thus could get Chris in; Cover themselves denied any association.

----- __227.13__ -----2022-03-19 01:53:04+08:00:

It's exactly the sort of thing I'm describing, yes.

----- __227.14__ -----2022-03-19 02:07:34+08:00:

You're right that Nijisanji could have been given more attention here; I didn't give it said attention for three main reasons:

1. I'm not a particularly avid Nijisanji watcher;

2. I was literally running out of space because of Reddit's character limit on posts;

3. There's just less in terms of interesting Nijisanji drama at this time (I guess Nijisanji Resistance? But that was quite short-lived and non-acrimonious), which makes it hard to find good threads summarising the more general state of affairs as context for said drama.

I also focussed on Hololive not because it was prominent then, but rather because:

1. It is basically *the* example of an agency that sucessfully transitioned from a full-mocap 3D production approach to Live2D;

2. Said transition is thematically relevant to my thesis statement about VTubing giving up much of its potential innovativeness as a medium;

3. I'm more familiar with it, and I presume the same is true of my readership.

EDIT: In effect, my post was focussing less on the actual 'democratisation' and more on how it impacted those who had got into the business beforehand: those that embraced the transition like Hololive, and those that tried to stay the course like Activ8 and Unlimited.

----- __227.15__ -----2022-03-19 02:10:40+08:00:

Yeah so I did almost not post this here because of Rule 8, but it doesn't seem to have been consistently enforced on VTuber-related topics because there have been four threads on VTubers before without getting removed, so precedent suggested it'd be fine:

----- __227.16__ -----2022-03-19 02:15:05+08:00:

Yeah, it's why as I said, the Hitomi Chris situation seems to have been complex and ugly, but hard to pick apart as a casual, non-Japanese-speaking viewer because of how small it was at the time, and in turn how little there is in English on it. While the guy was definitely the principal perpetrator here, if this version of events is true he was also kind of defrauded by Chris in some way, so you do kind of get why Hololive might have dropped her, agree with the decision or otherwise.

----- __227.17__ -----2022-03-19 02:43:15+08:00:

Thanks for the share! Looks like an interesting view, when I can get round to it.

----- __227.18__ -----2022-03-19 02:45:34+08:00:

I felt a little guilty not replying as I didn't feel I had anything to add or push back on here, so thanks for sharing your perspective!

----- __227.19__ -----2022-03-19 02:50:33+08:00:

Well, I'd say that if the community as a whole is, at least on a conscious level, averse to parasocial relationships, then that is, in the socially constructed sense, 'true' – arguably the only form of 'truth' that really matters. 

It's interesting you bring up the security point, not least because I didn't, although also because it's something I had wanted to put in my original post but cut due to space. These days there's a kind of post-hoc rationalisation of the anonymity angle as being about protecting identities, and I would suggest that that is, on a socially-constructed level, true: if the majority of creators and viewers are of the opinion that that is the function of that particular conceit, then that is why the conceit exists and continues to. But originally, the non-publicisation of the VA was arguably so Activ8 could get more money out of Kizuna AI and limit Kasuga Nozomi's leverage.

But what this all boils down to is the wider point I was making, which is that while there are plenty of holdovers from the early years of VTubing, the underlying ethos has shifted. The parasocial problem is definitely there and will likely never go away, but it's something that is no longer seen as an intended result of VTubing but rather as an unfortunate side-effect.

----- __227.20__ -----2022-03-19 03:01:52+08:00:

Ooh okay!

So as noted, my main thing is Hololive so it'll mostly be Holomems here (sorry!) and even then I'm going to have to narrow down from 'I really like basically all of EN and quite a few of the others!' a bit...

HoloEN Myth's Mori Calliope got me into VTubers and is probably my absolute favourite, though not by a huge margin: though those who know me know that I'm also very big on HoloEN Council's Ceres Fauna these days, and I also watch HoloID's Pavolia Reine quite a bit. I've also been getting into VShojo's Froot a bit lately (which has been a lot easier ever since Holodex started making Twitch streams more easily accessible). One smaller English-language VTuber to check out is [Milky Queen](https://twitter.com/milkyqueen_idol?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), a bilingual streamer who's part of a unit called Mai Princess and mostly streams on Twitch rather than YouTube these days. Milky's actually been around for a while – she was Calli's introduction to VTubers – and there's a lot to like about her and her content, and she's put out some real bangers on the music side of things too.

While I barely have any Japanese skills worth mentioning I do follow a few of Hololive's Japanese talents: 3rd Gen's Shirogane Noel and 0th's Sakura Miko mainly, though I've also been getting into 6th Gen's Hakui Koyori and Gamers' Ookamio Mio lately. I think what helps is that with all four there's a very strong vibe that doesn't really require strong language skills, at least for me. Also, on a pure music front I'm very keen on 0th's Hoshimachi Suisei.

As noted, I'm sorry I don't really have many non-major-agency (indeed, non-Hololive) recommendations here; it's just the main group I follow and also probably the one that has the best accessibility for English-speakers.
