### 221: [额 as a Royal Title?](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/tdiyzx/额_as_a_royal_title/), submitted on 2022-03-14 07:00:44+08:00.

----- __221.1__ -----2022-03-14 08:36:30+08:00:

To reiterate and expand on the other two comments, the Manchu ᡝᠨᠶᡝ *eniye* 'mother' was loaned into Beijing Mandarin as 額娘 *eniang*, but I cannot find examples of 額皇 in use anywhere; was this a misreading or mishearing on your part? Or is it there in the subtitles?

----- __221.2__ -----2022-03-14 08:42:48+08:00:

As I understand it, 朕 *zhen* as the first-person pronoun for emperors has been enshrined since the Qin, rather than being a specifically Manchu construction.

### 222: [If ernst rohm (The leader of the Nazi SA) were to survive until the Nuremberg Trials, what would he be convicted of?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tdoh6s/if_ernst_rohm_the_leader_of_the_nazi_sa_were_to/), submitted on 2022-03-14 11:53:14+08:00.

### 223: [For those who can't see Calli in 3D this Sunday, don't worry! She's got some good stuff planned for everyone! Sasuga dad!](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tesd12/for_those_who_cant_see_calli_in_3d_this_sunday/), submitted on 2022-03-16 00:03:40+08:00.

----- __223.1__ -----2022-03-16 01:25:46+08:00:

So I think I have a rough idea as to what it might potentially be, based on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/moricalliope/status/1502351888536113152) from just a few days ago...

### 224: [Would Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China to alleviate poverty work in other impoverished or imperialized nations?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tf8y47/would_deng_xiaopings_reforms_in_china_to/), submitted on 2022-03-16 12:09:47+08:00.

### 225: [What are some of the most unexpected or strangest ISOLATED incidences where countries that are totally remote to each other seem to have greatly impacted each other culturally, politically, etc. without any obvious reason?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tg2igu/what_are_some_of_the_most_unexpected_or_strangest/), submitted on 2022-03-17 13:06:23+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.

### 226: [The composure and safety-mindedness of the HL talent in emergency situations- but only in emergency situations.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tgvn5w/the_composure_and_safetymindedness_of_the_hl/), submitted on 2022-03-18 15:14:48+08:00.

----- __226.1__ -----2022-03-18 20:57:48+08:00:

Weirdly enough, there's been a [virtual weathercaster](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Weatheroid_Type_A_Airi) since even before Kizuna AI.

### 227: [[Virtual Youtubers] The First Years of VTubing: Stardom, Scandal, and the Shaping of the Modern Industry](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/th0gow/virtual_youtubers_the_first_years_of_vtubing/), submitted on 2022-03-18 20:44:28+08:00.

### Sources:

Unfortunately there's not a lot of what might be considered 'good' sourcing on a lot of VTuber history. Most of it is in Japanese of course, and even if you're good at it you'll be reliant on people actually compiling sources. The [Virtual Youtuber Wiki](virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki) obviously has limitations but it's a good source for basic information and timelines; for more in-depth discussion including 'forbidden knowledge' (i.e. alternate and IRL identities) the subreddit /r/VirtualYoutubers has a lot of old threads on the topic, with the ones I consulted while writing this post listed here:

Believe it or not there is also an actual academic article on the subject of the Multiple AI controversy: Stevie Suan's 'Performing Virtual YouTubers: Acting Across Borders in the Platform Society', in [this open-access book](https://mediarep.org/handle/doc/18067), *Japan's Contemporary Media Culture between Local and Global: Content, Practice and Theory* edited by Martin Roth, Yoshida Hiroshi and Martin Picard.

I think I need to declare here that despite a somewhat dispassionate tone in my post I am a bit of a Hololive fanatic, so apologies if my comments see me jumping more to the defence of the modern industry.

So, all told, the interval between Kizuna AI's debut and the introduction of iPhone X and face-only Live2D was barely a year, which was not a lot of time for the companies established in that time (Activ8 and COVER) to get that much in terms of revenues to fund a massive suite of new Live2D members. I'd argue it was entirely new companies, which were able to put all their startup funding into Live2D, that profited most from the switch – Nijisanji being the arch-example.

Thanks for the tip-off, I was using the wrong site's formatting (too used to Discord's these days)
