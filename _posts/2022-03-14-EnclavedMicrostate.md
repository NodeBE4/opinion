### 220: [额 as a Royal Title?](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/tdiyzx/额_as_a_royal_title/), submitted on 2022-03-14 07:00:44+08:00.

To reiterate and expand on the other two comments, the Manchu ᡝᠨᠶᡝ *eniye* 'mother' was loaned into Beijing Mandarin as 額娘 *eniang*, but I cannot find examples of 額皇 in use anywhere; was this a misreading or mishearing on your part? Or is it there in the subtitles?

----- __220.2__ -----2022-03-14 08:42:48+08:00:

As I understand it, 朕 *zhen* as the first-person pronoun for emperors has been enshrined since the Qin, rather than being a specifically Manchu construction.

### 222: [For those who can't see Calli in 3D this Sunday, don't worry! She's got some good stuff planned for everyone! Sasuga dad!](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tesd12/for_those_who_cant_see_calli_in_3d_this_sunday/), submitted on 2022-03-16 00:03:40+08:00.

----- __222.1__ -----2022-03-16 01:25:46+08:00:

So I think I have a rough idea as to what it might potentially be, based on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/moricalliope/status/1502351888536113152) from just a few days ago...

### 223: [Would Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China to alleviate poverty work in other impoverished or imperialized nations?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tf8y47/would_deng_xiaopings_reforms_in_china_to/), submitted on 2022-03-16 12:09:47+08:00.
