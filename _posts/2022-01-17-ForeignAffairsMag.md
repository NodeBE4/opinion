### 98: [Time for NATO to Close Its Door: The Alliance Is Too Big—and Too Provocative—for Its Own Good](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/s702wk/time_for_nato_to_close_its_door_the_alliance_is/), submitted on 2022-01-18 23:28:15+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Michael Kimmage, Professor of History at the Catholic University of America\]

"To simplify its strategic purpose and to improve its defensive capacities, NATO should publicly and explicitly forswear adding any more members. The alliance should make clear that its long phase of expansion is over. Ending the open-door policy, tricky as it would be to execute, and rethinking the security architecture of central and eastern Europe would not be a concession to Putin. To the contrary, it is necessary in order for the most successful alliance of the twentieth century to endure and prosper in the twenty-first."

### 99: [Macron’s Flawed Vision for Europe: Persistent Divisions Will Preclude His Dreams of Global Power](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/s7scbt/macrons_flawed_vision_for_europe_persistent/), submitted on 2022-01-19 23:15:45+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Francis J. Gavin Director of the Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins University, and Alina Polyakova, President and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis\]

"Macron’s vision is more of a laundry list, addressing everything from increased multilateralism to counterterrorism strategies to talks about beefing up the continent’s security. Some proposals seem contradictory, such as the desire for a France that possesses 'the ability to rank and have influence among other nations,' a country in which the French would be the “master of our own destiny,” yet also a country in which 'our independent decision-making is fully compatible with our unwavering solidarity with our European partners.' Other ideas seem problematic and unlikely to find wide adherence, such as Macron’s suggestion that 'there can be no defense and security project of European citizens without political vision seeking to advance gradual rebuilding of confidence with Russia.'  
This vision assumes that a continent with a long history of divisions is now united on its defense and foreign policy. But a cursory look at the recent debates on Russia, China, and even the United States shows a lack of strategic coherence among European states. Macron’s vision, in short, could splinter Europe and dilute its capabilities and focus, all while playing into the United States’ worst instincts to disengage from the transatlantic alliance to focus on China."

### 100: [Privacy Is Power: How Tech Policy Can Bolster Democracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/s8101n/privacy_is_power_how_tech_policy_can_bolster/), submitted on 2022-01-20 05:25:43+08:00.

----- __100.1__ -----2022-01-20 05:26:18+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Andrew Imbrie, Daniel Baer, Andrew Trask, Anna Puglisi, Erik Brattberg, and Helen Toner\]

"History is rarely forgiving, but as we adopt the next phase of digital tools, policymakers can avoid the errors of the past. Privacy-enhancing technologies, or PETs, are a collection of technologies with applications ranging from improved medical diagnostics to secure voting systems and messaging platforms. PETs allow researchers to harness big data to solve problems affecting billions of people while also protecting privacy. As their use becomes widespread, a new paradigm will emerge, in which private data is more readily available for research and problem solving and public data on private citizens is better protected. Much like the Internet itself, PETs have become a dividing line between democratic and authoritarian governments with implications for privacy and accountability. With foresight, however, the United States and its allies can realize the benefits of PETs while preventing the most dangerous outcomes. Indeed, the announcement at U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent Summit for Democracy of a joint effort by the United Kingdom and the United States to create a grand challenge aimed at fostering innovation in PETs signals the importance some advanced democracies are attaching to this effort."

### 101: [America Needs a Bolder Biden: A Year In, His Foreign Policy Is Too Cautious and Conventional](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/s8sytj/america_needs_a_bolder_biden_a_year_in_his/), submitted on 2022-01-21 05:07:02+08:00.

----- __101.1__ -----2022-01-21 05:08:11+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Emma Ashford, senior fellow in the New American Engagement Initiative at the Atlantic Council\]

"Biden’s rhetoric often suggests that he could be a visionary on international affairs: the kind of leader the United States needs to make tough strategic choices facing the country, whether on nuclear posture, Middle East wars, or a pivot to Asia. But if he is to do so, his administration needs to get out of its defensive crouch, make tough choices, and own them. The president made the right choice on Afghanistan: to put aside political considerations and instead pursue “the fundamental national security interest of the United States of America.” It’s time he applied that resolute approach to foreign policy more broadly."
