### 98: [Time for NATO to Close Its Door: The Alliance Is Too Big—and Too Provocative—for Its Own Good](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/s702wk/time_for_nato_to_close_its_door_the_alliance_is/), submitted on 2022-01-18 23:28:15+08:00.

"To simplify its strategic purpose and to improve its defensive capacities, NATO should publicly and explicitly forswear adding any more members. The alliance should make clear that its long phase of expansion is over. Ending the open-door policy, tricky as it would be to execute, and rethinking the security architecture of central and eastern Europe would not be a concession to Putin. To the contrary, it is necessary in order for the most successful alliance of the twentieth century to endure and prosper in the twenty-first."

### 99: [Macron’s Flawed Vision for Europe: Persistent Divisions Will Preclude His Dreams of Global Power](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/s7scbt/macrons_flawed_vision_for_europe_persistent/), submitted on 2022-01-19 23:15:45+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Francis J. Gavin Director of the Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins University, and Alina Polyakova, President and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis\]

"Macron’s vision is more of a laundry list, addressing everything from increased multilateralism to counterterrorism strategies to talks about beefing up the continent’s security. Some proposals seem contradictory, such as the desire for a France that possesses 'the ability to rank and have influence among other nations,' a country in which the French would be the “master of our own destiny,” yet also a country in which 'our independent decision-making is fully compatible with our unwavering solidarity with our European partners.' Other ideas seem problematic and unlikely to find wide adherence, such as Macron’s suggestion that 'there can be no defense and security project of European citizens without political vision seeking to advance gradual rebuilding of confidence with Russia.'  
This vision assumes that a continent with a long history of divisions is now united on its defense and foreign policy. But a cursory look at the recent debates on Russia, China, and even the United States shows a lack of strategic coherence among European states. Macron’s vision, in short, could splinter Europe and dilute its capabilities and focus, all while playing into the United States’ worst instincts to disengage from the transatlantic alliance to focus on China."
