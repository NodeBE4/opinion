### 98: [Time for NATO to Close Its Door: The Alliance Is Too Big—and Too Provocative—for Its Own Good](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/s702wk/time_for_nato_to_close_its_door_the_alliance_is/), submitted on 2022-01-18 23:28:15+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Michael Kimmage, Professor of History at the Catholic University of America\]

"To simplify its strategic purpose and to improve its defensive capacities, NATO should publicly and explicitly forswear adding any more members. The alliance should make clear that its long phase of expansion is over. Ending the open-door policy, tricky as it would be to execute, and rethinking the security architecture of central and eastern Europe would not be a concession to Putin. To the contrary, it is necessary in order for the most successful alliance of the twentieth century to endure and prosper in the twenty-first."
