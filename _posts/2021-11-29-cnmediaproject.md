RT Malin Oud<br>I would be very interested to see the evidence which IOC base their “quiet diplomacy” approach on. There’s actually a lof of research, experience and evidence that show the opposite of what they claim here.

So China held its international forum on democracy yesterday, anticipating Biden's Summit for Democracy. The keynote yesterday was delivered by the CCP's minister of propaganda. Does that not sum it up? <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-12/05/nw.D110000renmrb_20211205_1-04.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-12/05/nw.D110000renmrb_20211205_1-04.htm</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF1GGxmVIAEZRMS?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
