Super exciting to receive Advances in Experimental Political Science (@CUP_PoliSci)! Learned a ton from Jamie Druckman, Don Green, and everyone who contributed. Useful for anyone doing & interested in doing experiments in social science.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4lZc8HVkAA2MYI?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
