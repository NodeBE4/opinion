> Sean Connery turned down the role of Gandalf

I cannot envision Sean Connery as Gandalf.

### 470: [What job position is 100% overvalued and overpaid?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/113uw7u/what_job_position_is_100_overvalued_and_overpaid/), submitted on 2023-02-17 00:40:52+08:00.

> up to 65,000 if I coached a sport and did summer school

If you want to be a teacher, I really recommend you do it as a hobby on top of a job in the private sector.  Teaching college students as an adjunct will give you the satisfaction you want, while you can earn enough money to live comfortably doing something else.

> I highly recommend that teaching part. Even if it's for a couple of years it's so worth it just to get involved with these kiddos in high school for a little while. .... We need math teachers. And male role models.

In my opinion, schools should have more working professionals with jobs in fields that are relevant to core high school subjects teach those subjects.
