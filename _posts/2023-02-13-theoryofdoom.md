> Sean Connery turned down the role of Gandalf

I cannot envision Sean Connery as Gandalf.

> up to 65,000 if I coached a sport and did summer school

If you want to be a teacher, I really recommend you do it as a hobby on top of a job in the private sector.  Teaching college students as an adjunct will give you the satisfaction you want, while you can earn enough money to live comfortably doing something else.

In my opinion, schools should have more working professionals with jobs in fields that are relevant to core high school subjects teach those subjects.

The media also never questioned when the EPA said the air in New York was save to breathe after 9/11, until years too late.  

This isn't a new phenomena.  It's just happening again, at this current moment.
