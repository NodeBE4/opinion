Yeah that's the thing – I don't get where people got the NDA narrative from because that's not what it said, just a contract violation in the general sense. An NDA just means you can't disclose aspects of the agreement in and of itself, but as you said, the statement suggests it was other company info being leaked.

And someone *else* did a double-decker for Miko!

----- __241.2__ -----2022-03-22 06:36:09+08:00:

And that one separate group that did Miko.

That ended up wrapping up after two months as scheduled, AFAIK.
