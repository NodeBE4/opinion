### 482: [Cochrane Review (the most rigorous and extensive review of the scientific literature and underlying data) concludes that neither surgical masks nor N95 masks have been shown to make a difference in reducing the spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/11cvj9l/cochrane_review_the_most_rigorous_and_extensive/), submitted on 2023-02-27 06:57:28+08:00.

I am aware this link has been shared on subreddits that a lot of folks here will disagree with.  

I remind each and every one of you: this is about science, evidence and data.  Not politics.

If you were mislead into believing masks made a difference because you believed incompetent experts (i.e., the people who failed to do their job correctly) that's not your fault.  

You relied on them.  And they failed.

That doesn't make you gullible.  It makes them incompetent. 

But now the question is whether, in the face of evidence you previously did not have, will you change your mind?

If you believe in science, then you will change your mind based on new evidence.

If you are an idiot, you will argue that this Cochrane Review is wrong.

And you would have to be an idiot to challenge a Cochrane Review.

> you've posted a link to a magazine

Since you clearly failed to identify the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/11cvj9l/cochrane_review_the_most_rigorous_and_extensive/ja5fq33/), I initially posted, I'll post it once again.  

This way, you can't possibly fail to overlook it.

Do better.

----- __482.4__ -----2023-02-27 09:26:07+08:00:

That's understandable.

----- __482.5__ -----2023-02-27 10:30:10+08:00:

Indeed.  Do you understand what that means?

----- __482.6__ -----2023-02-27 10:41:59+08:00:

Cochrane is evaluating the research, as it exists.  They find the research inadequate to support the claim that masks make a difference, for COVID transmission.

The studies supposedly reaching the conclusion that masks, in fact, do make a difference are unreliable for various reasons.  Cochrane explains why.  

This matters because we cannot make claims about what something does, when we do not have evidence to support the idea we're advancing. 

This matters because it rejects the premise that most people have been incorrectly caused to believe as axiomatic: that masks not only make a difference, but they are critical to prevent COVID transmission.

It would be like if I sold you a drug to prevent cancer, but the data from all of my clinical trials found no such benefit.  I think we can all understand doing that would be very bad.

> Your comments and abrasive attitude

I don't think you understand my perspective.  Nor do you understand why this is a source of outrage for me.  I want accountability for those in my field who knew better than to ever mislead the public with the bullshit that Cochrane is calling out.   We (i.e., folks in the field) knew better and dropped the ball, over and over again.  

My ire is focused on my peers and my field.  Not you, or anyone who believed what you heard from the media.  So, do not feel like this is about you. It is not about you (unless your name is on one of the papers Cochrane was talking about). 

> This is not the final word on the matter 

You're right!  Nothing in science is ever final.  We try to reach the best conclusion we can with good evidence and reliable methods.  But sometimes folks drop the ball. They reach unsupported conclusions with terrible evidence on unreliable methods.  That is what happened here. 

It is possible that further research may be undertaken.  And that research might reliably find that masks make a difference.   As it stands now, there is not now nor has there ever been good science to back such claims.  That's the point of the whole article. 

> A quick search results in many articles that raise some questions on how to read the report. 

Cochrane cuts the wheat from the chaff.  Which everyone in this field understands.  If your name was on a supposed paper Cochrane just said was bad, I'm sure you'd have all kinds of things to say about it too.  

> also conclude that it isn't an open and shut case.

If your name was on an article Cochrane called out, I'd bet you'd be unhappy about it too.  I'd be happy to let them speak, and hear what they have to say.  Although, these media stories are an irrelevant distraction.  

We live in a world where there is so much information out there, it's very hard to know what to think.  That's why we have things like peer review, to make sure we're not publishing bullshit.  Sometimes those checks aren't enough.  

> Two examples are below 

Neither of them change the bottom line.  The bottom line is simple: there is no credible research that supports claims that masks reduce COVID transmission.  

It wasn't your job to figure that out, though.  So it's not like you're responsible.
