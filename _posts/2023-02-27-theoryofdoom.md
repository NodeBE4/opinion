### 482: [Cochrane Review (the most rigorous and extensive review of the scientific literature and underlying data) concludes that neither surgical masks nor N95 masks have been shown to make a difference in reducing the spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/11cvj9l/cochrane_review_the_most_rigorous_and_extensive/), submitted on 2023-02-27 06:57:28+08:00.

I am aware this link has been shared on subreddits that a lot of folks here will disagree with.  

I remind each and every one of you: this is about science, evidence and data.  Not politics.

If you were mislead into believing masks made a difference because you believed incompetent experts (i.e., the people who failed to do their job correctly) that's not your fault.  

You relied on them.  And they failed.

That doesn't make you gullible.  It makes them incompetent. 

But now the question is whether, in the face of evidence you previously did not have, will you change your mind?

If you believe in science, then you will change your mind based on new evidence.

If you are an idiot, you will argue that this Cochrane Review is wrong.

And you would have to be an idiot to challenge a Cochrane Review.

> you've posted a link to a magazine

Since you clearly failed to identify the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/11cvj9l/cochrane_review_the_most_rigorous_and_extensive/ja5fq33/), I initially posted, I'll post it once again.  

This way, you can't possibly fail to overlook it.

Do better.

----- __482.4__ -----2023-02-27 09:26:07+08:00:

That's understandable.

----- __482.5__ -----2023-02-27 10:30:10+08:00:

Indeed.  Do you understand what that means?

----- __482.6__ -----2023-02-27 10:41:59+08:00:

Cochrane is evaluating the research, as it exists.  They find the research inadequate to support the claim that masks make a difference, for COVID transmission.

The studies supposedly reaching the conclusion that masks, in fact, do make a difference are unreliable for various reasons.  Cochrane explains why.  

This matters because we cannot make claims about what something does, when we do not have evidence to support the idea we're advancing. 

This matters because it rejects the premise that most people have been incorrectly caused to believe as axiomatic: that masks not only make a difference, but they are critical to prevent COVID transmission.

It would be like if I sold you a drug to prevent cancer, but the data from all of my clinical trials found no such benefit.  I think we can all understand doing that would be very bad.
