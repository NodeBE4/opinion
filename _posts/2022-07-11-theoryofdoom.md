u/Worried_Protection48, this is not the place for bringing your drama from other subreddits.  Keep the flaming out of this sub.

### 340: [Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration on Wednesday announced some eliminations of vaccine requirements](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/vzpn74/gov_jb_pritzkers_administration_on_wednesday/), submitted on 2022-07-15 22:09:30+08:00.

> Either he knew it was safe(r) in Florida or he knowingly put his family in grave danger.

Pritzker isn't a public health expert, knows nothing about epidemiological forecasting or any kind of statistical/mathematical modeling.  It's just not in his wheelhouse to know.  Frankly it would be unreasonable for me to expect him to know that.

But he relied on people who didn't know either, and JB toed the party line the entire way through.  That's the issue.

> I would love to see Pritzker try to run nationally on his COVID track record. 

Many people in this state and here in this subreddit believe JB did a great job, based on his "following the science." As I am sure everyone knows by now, I disagree with essentially every decision JB made from March 2020 forward.  But I remain amazed at how the early messaging on these so called "public health" measures remains the effective baseline for most people.  Empirical evidence to the contrary be damned.
