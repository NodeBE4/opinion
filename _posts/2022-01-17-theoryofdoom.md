> The Green Mile by Stephen King.

I read Green Mile shortly after it came out.  I think that was the first time I ever really concretely understood what evil was.  It was weeks before I got over it.

Submission Statement:

This Associated Press article reports that Russia has moved an additional and unspecified amount of troops to Ukraine's borders, including with Belarus.  These new Russian troop buildup efforts follow multilateral failures to resolve diplomatically.  According to the White House and Ukrainian officials, the threat of Russian invasion is imminent and escalating. The Kremlin and Russian defense ministry deny any intent to invade.  NATO and allies continue their efforts to negotiate a resolution that does not involve war.

Not a stupid question, especially given all the nonsense out there on this issue (e.g., Russia's facially absurd claims that Ukraine somehow represents a military threat).  

There are short-term gains Putin expects to incur from invading Ukraine.  But they're just fringe benefits.  What matters is what is what Putin and Russia stand to lose, if Ukraine starts exporting natural gas to Europe. 

There's a very large natural gas field off of Ukraine's coast in the Black Sea.  It's largely untouched and there are less than 100 wells drilled there.  For perspective, there are more than 7,000 wells in the North Sea.  Control of the Black Sea's natural gas reserves enhances and further consolidates Russia's control over that resource and its exportation to Europe.  

Russia is one of the world's largest producers of oil and gas, and its influence of those markets represents one of its most significant sources of power.  Natural gas in particular has been Russia's third-largest export for many years, after crude oil and refined petrochemicals.  Russia exports more natural gas than any country on earth and has the largest proven natural gas reserves on earth.  The only country on earth that produces more natural gas is the United States.  Client states include essentially every country in Central and Eastern Europe who do not have their own reserves.  Beyond the former Soviet bloc, Germany is a critical client-state for Russia.  

Now, consider the world where foreign oil and gas conglomerates start tapping wells in the Black Sea in cooperation with the Ukrainian government.  Obviously at the moment, Ukraine doesn't have the infrastructure or technical capacity to even get it out of the ground.  But what if they did?  Ukraine has no interest in cooperating with Russia on natural gas exports whatsoever.  Every country that relies on Russia for natural gas would far rather buy it from Ukraine than Russia.  

Suppose that happens.  If Ukraine develops a viable natural gas export industry with its reserves in the Black Sea, Russia is frozen out of the Soviet bloc and Germany.  Ukraine's relationship with Europe generally and Germany in particular solidifies based on their underlying trade cooperation.  In that case, Ukraine has a pathway to NATO membership which it has lacked since 1991.  

So that's what this is all about.  Putin is trying to knee-cap a competitor before they even have the chance to get off the ground. That is why Putin is massing troops on Ukraine's border and is more likely than not to invade.

----- __38.3__ -----2022-01-19 07:44:50+08:00:

> Why does he do this so obvious and slowly?

That is a function of imminence and opportunity.  Ukraine is not an imminent economic threat to Russia, its natural gas industry or control of natural gas supply in Europe.  Putin has the time to wait for an opportune moment, because Ukraine has essentially no capacity to realize the potential for natural gas extraction in the Black Sea.  Ukraine might develop that capacity with the help of foreign oil companies, but that's unlikely to happen any time soon given the trouble Putin has caused in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.  So, by invading Ukraine in 2014 (shortly after Exxon discovered the reserves in the Black Sea), Putin delayed Ukraine industrial development.

Putin likewise has to wait for the right opportunity.  Putin got away with invading Georgia in 2008 because Bush was preoccupied in Iraq and needed Russia's continued cooperation to resupply American military efforts in Afghanistan.  That's why Putin moved on Georgia when he did, and not before.  Ukraine was a more desperate venture, however.  Before and shortly after Maidan, there was some real potential for natural gas development in the Black Sea, even to the point that Turkey was approached to build a new canal to get around the Montreux Convention.  That project is currently titled "Canal Istanbul," if you were curious.  

The question is whether now is the right opportunity.  The two actors of primary relevance are the United States and Germany.  For Putin, the key issue that keeps him from invading Ukraine is uncertainty over whether Biden would or could lead a unilateral military or NATO response.  

Factors playing in Putin's favor include: (1) there is no appetite for war in any NATO country; (2) no one outside of the United States has confidence in Joe Biden or his military leadership; and (3) every country in Europe with the military capability to hold off the Russian army faces considerable internal problems.  

The American military withdrawal from Afghanistan was the single greatest military loss the United States has experienced since the pull-out from Vietnam.  Mark Milley not being relieved after his catastrophic failure and unparallelled incompetence in Afghanistan was a clear signal:  Biden's administration has other priorities.  Not to mention, Bush's war in Iraq still looms like a dark cloud.  Further, Europe is crippled due to COVID-19 and self-inflicted wounds resulting from its responses.  All the while, it's the middle of winter.  Germany and others who depend on Russia for natural gas can't afford the risk that Russia might turn it off  Putin knows this, which is obviously why he is not moving in the summer.  

Odds are slim Putin will ever have a better opportunity than this precise moment.

I ignored the part of your question relating to obviousness, because it is incorrect to assume that Putin's motives and interests are obvious in any general sense.  

Putin's motives are obvious to a select few who understand how he operates, but not to all.  If they were obvious to everyone, you wouldn't have asked the question you did in the first place.  By now, we'd all know it and you would have heard what I said on the news.  Someone would have made the connection between what is under the Black Sea, Ukraine's border with the Black Sea and Russia's control of natural gas in Europe.  But sadly, realism (read: common sense) has yielded to free floating notions of Russia's "historical sphere of influence" (e.g., Mearsheimer), illusions of "western expansionism" or other such nonsense. 

The White House, for example, cannot figure out what Putin is up to which is why Jen Sacki keeps trying to put the "ball" in "Putin's court."  According to public information released in a WSJ Op-Ed I linked as further reading to a submission statement a while back, the IC knows what is going on --- but when people who are supposed to provide "oversight" talk about the IC's understanding of this issue they obfuscate and confuse the issues (e.g., anything Adam Schiff says on CNN, at any time, ever).  

Beyond what I said above, there are scores of different items of disinformation Putin has tried to hold out as justification or Russia's military aggression.  The most recent category of that nonsense is the illusion that Ukraine represents a "military threat" to Russia.  This claim is transparently absurd to someone who understands Putin.  But most do not.  Russian media have repeated that narrative, which comes from the highest levels of Russian government, nonstop for weeks now.  Russian media further claim that the United States and NATO are sponsoring terrorism against "ethnic Russians" in Eastern Ukraine.  And last friday, the White House released a statement that Russia is preparing a "pretext" to justify invading Ukraine.  I suspect that pretext may involve the surface to air missiles Putin is moving West from Novosibirsk, but it could be a repeat of Beslan or anything else.  

That's how Putin plays this game.  Some just happen to be able to see through it.

> Geopolitically, the stars have aligned quite well for Putin, and I agree that it's now or never in his mind. 

I agree.  In fact, it's breathtaking how strongly fate has seemed to favor Putin in this past year. 

> He may still decide to back down, but he knows that if he does, his battle with the world will likely start to become a battle back at home.

I agree, but I doubt Putin will.  What Putin is trying to figure out is whether NATO will retaliate.  In invading Ukraine, Putin risks the nightmare scenario where he's at war with NATO and Western oil companies start to develop the Black Sea.  Any significant military loss would almost certainly mean the Montreux Convention is supplanted by something less favorable to Russia, Ukraine joining NATO and Russia not only losing control of the natural gas under the Black Sea --- but the Black Sea itself.  

So that's what he's waiting on.  That's why he's moving slowly, so he can gradually escallate and assess changes to the risks he faces at each stage.  Putin needs to take Ukraine without military resistance of any kind.

Just be careful with money stuff.  If you can negotiate the currency in which get paid, go for Euros or better yet Swiss Francs.  If you must obtain loans, make sure you are borrowing and paying in rubles.

The nightmare scenario is that you have loans which must be paid in Euros but you get paid in Rubles.  Then, Russia invades Ukraine and sanctions vitiate the ruble's buying power.  But you still have to pay loans in Euros.  All of a sudden, the 1/10th of your paycheck that went to the loan now is more like 3/4ths of your paycheck.  

Otherwise you will be fine.  Russia is a nice country.

> If we're talking about fewer than 100 wells in Ukraine's side of the Black Sea, is it even an adequate amount of natural gas to start producing and exporting, that a big-time producer like Russia would go to war over? 

That's an excellent question.  Ukraine does not have the infrastructure to export natural gas at any kind of scale that would threaten Russia at this time.  However, if Ukraine signed a joint venture with Exxon, that infrastructure (enough wells) could be developed in a very short period of time.  Like less than three years, probably.

> What I'm asking is, is it even a viable alternative for Germany in the long run to switch to importing gas from Ukraine?

Based on the extent of the untapped reserves in the Black Sea, yes.  And it's not just Ukraine, either.  Romania and Turkey want in on the action.  

> Or is the real problem here Ukraine's potential "pathway to NATO"?

Ukraine only gets a pathway to NATO membership if it starts selling gas to Europe.  And both of those things are a big problem for Putin.

----- __38.8__ -----2022-01-19 10:20:20+08:00:

> This means an invasion of and war with Ukraine is not a matter of if, but when.

Correct, absent other political changes inside Ukraine which result in Russia getting exclusive access to Ukraine's natural gas.  

> First time I heard about the gas field, makes a lot of sense of the Russian motive.

I question whether anyone has briefed Biden on this.  I doubt Sacki could even find Ukraine on a map.

----- __38.9__ -----2022-01-19 10:34:12+08:00:

> Do you know if NATO has built up any kind of reserves, supplies, ammo stocks, shipping armed vehicles, et cetera to support any sizeable military action in Ukraine?

The White House has been coy about military options.  This has led some to incorrectly conclude that all military options are off the table and sanctions are the limit of what the United States is willing to do.  But actions speak louder than words.  Recently, Biden reactivated the 56th artillery command.  Only the IC and military seemed to notice.  The media are preoccupied with other things.  Biden also either has considered or is in the process of diverting military aid meant for Afghanistan to Ukraine.  

Notably, it's not just the United States.  For example, Canadian special forces have been training the Ukrainian army for almost a year now.  I don't think any of this is enough to prepare for war.  It's just keeping that option open.

> Also, would this change Germany's mind on nuclear energy?

I have no idea.  Germany's hostility towards nuclear energy goes back to the earliest days of the anti-nuclear movement.  It should be lost on none that this is why they are beholden to Russian natural gas every winter.
