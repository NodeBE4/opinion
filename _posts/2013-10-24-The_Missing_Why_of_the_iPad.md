    took issue

   with my article,
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/whither-liberal-arts/">
    Whither Liberal Arts
   </a>
   :

  <blockquote>

    To this I have just one response. It’s the best Apple commercial in years – maybe of the decade:
   </p>
   <div align="center">
    <div class="video-player" id="v-RpKlRZ60-1">
     <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://videopress.com/embed/RpKlRZ60?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="640">
     </iframe>
    </div>
   </div>
   <p>
    And it debuted in April 2013. This advertisement – which is virtually perfect in every single way, is all about story. It is the absolute personification of story and emotion…
   </p>
   <p>
    So are we really going to say that liberal arts are gone from Apple because of an ad designed to show off the amazing industrial design of the iPad Air? Let’s be serious.

   This, unfortunately, completely misses the point (and misrepresents my argument to boot):

  <ul>
   <li>
    My disconcernment was not only with the iPad Air ad, but with the
    <em>
     entire keynote.
    </em>
    Everything was about Apple, from the opening repeat video to the self-praise for free to the ridiculous demo about the Eddy Cue poster. What was absent was any demo or discussion about the way
    <em>
     humans
    </em>
    might actually use Apple’s products for real (the

    spot being the clear exception).
