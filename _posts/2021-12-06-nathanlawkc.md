I am very honored to announce that I am invited by @POTUS to deliver a remark in The Summit for Democracy on 10th Dec.<br>The remark serves as a bridge between sessions on "protecting human rights" and "defending against authoritarianism." The voice of Hong Kong will be heard.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF4Sn2pWUAMW3KT?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

//Nathan Law was Hong Kong’s youngest elected lawmaker before he was imprisoned in August 2017 ... In #Freedom, he has penned a manifesto about how quickly freedom can be eroded or dismantled—and how every generation must fight to protect it.// <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/12/01/5-new-books-to-read-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fortune.com/2021/12/01/5-new-books-to-read-in-december/</a>

From a student protest leader, the youngest elected legislator in Hong Kong, to a political prisoner and exiled activist … these all happened in my 20s. <br><br>And this is the story I want to share. <br><br>#Freedom is available in the US & Canada on 7th Dec. <a href="http://bit.ly/Freedom-Book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://bit.ly/Freedom-Book</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF9b4lGXwBEW-Fa?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Media should stop directly quoting the Chinese govt's self-claim of "another version of democracy."<br><br>China under CCP control is a one-party dictatorship. No accountability, no rule of law, no opposition voice, and no election to its leadership. It is NOT a democracy.

I was again named by the HK govt top officials, including SS Chris Tang and Commissioner of Police, that my remark in #SummitForDemocracy violates the NSL and now am a “Class A wanted criminal.”<br>Campaigning for human rights is “secession” and “subversion” by Beijing’s definition.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FGCDT52X0AAhxda?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Friends in #NA:<br>“#Freedom” is out now. Reflecting on my #SummitforDemocracy remark, it's surely a timely read.<br>The story of Hong Kong is narrated through my life.
