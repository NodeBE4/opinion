I am very honored to announce that I am invited by @POTUS to deliver a remark in The Summit for Democracy on 10th Dec.<br>The remark serves as a bridge between sessions on "protecting human rights" and "defending against authoritarianism." The voice of Hong Kong will be heard.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF4Sn2pWUAMW3KT?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
