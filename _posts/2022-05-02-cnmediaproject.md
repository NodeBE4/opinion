RT 浦志强<br>我当然乐见中美关系恢复正常，但真想释放善意，至少换个人传递声音才行，阴阳怪气松松垮垮嘴脸道貌岸然的不行，所以赵立坚、汪文斌、华春莹都得换才行。我估计，环球时报、观察者网、共青团中央，加上外交部这三位发言人，乃至其部长王毅，已然是外国人眼中，中国的象征了。

The 2021 China Online Media Development Report, released last week, offers an interesting glimpse into CCP thinking on both the transformation of Party-led media and the operationalizing of private online platforms in the digital era. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/03/developing-online-media-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/03/developing-online-media-control/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRy6MZYaUAAVgTg?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Carl Minzner<br>Re @ChinaLawTransl8 @ehundman @niubi @TGTM_Official I'm w/@ChinaLawTransl8 - I think it's the control over translation. Beijing happy to have its own English translations of Xi's books.<br><br>But it is increasingly uncomfortable w/alternative channels, particularly those piercing linguistic barrier to portray reality *in* China.

RT Thomas Yau<br>1/2 A major controversy in #Shanghai lockdown is how much power does neighbourhood committees ("Ju Wei") have. Technically they are self-governing bodies of residents, but in reality they are under the leadership of street admin ("Jie Dao").<br><br>Edward Lawrence: As already mentioned, four days ago we were meant to be released and allowed into our sub-district due to not having any cases for weeks, but compound management won't allow it - and the final decision is theirs. Guess they don't want to risk any consequences if it goes wrong...<br>
