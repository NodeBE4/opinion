<p>I am excited to announce both a new podcast and a substantial expansion in the value of a Stratechery subscription. We&#8217;ll start with the podcast:</p><p><a href="https://sharptech.fm"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/stratecheryplus-2.png?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sharp Tech with Ben Thompson" width="640" height="640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9739" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/stratecheryplus-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/stratecheryplus-2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/stratecheryplus-2.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/stratecheryplus-2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/stratecheryplus-2.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/stratecheryplus-2.png?resize=630%2C630&amp;ssl=1 630w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p><p><a href="https://sharptech.fm/">Sharp Tech with Ben Thompson</a> is a new podcast from <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewsharp">Andrew Sharp</a> and myself about how technology works, and the ways it is impacting the world.

If you enjoy Stratechery Articles you will love the Stratechery Update.</p><p>Stratechery Interviews include interviews with leading public CEOs like <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse/">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-about-manufacturing-intelligence/">Jensen Huang</a>, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/microsoft-build-microsofts-strategic-clarity-an-interview-with-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella/">Satya Nadella</a>; the Founder Series with private company founders like <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-rippling-founder-parker-conrad/">Parker Conrad</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-update-on-the-founder-series-shopify-partners-with-shippo-an-interview-with-shippo-founder-laura-behrens-wu/">Laura Behrens Wu</a>, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-coda-founder-shishir-mehrotra/">Shishir Mehrotra</a>; and discussions with fellow analysts like <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-the-future-of-digital-advertising/">Eric Seufert</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-the-metaverse-author-matthew-ball/">Matthew Ball</a>, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/iphone-production-site-locked-down-an-interview-with-bill-bishop-about-china-and-substack/">Bill Bishop</a>.</p><p>Dithering is a twice-weekly podcast from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber</a> and myself: 15 minutes an episode, not a minute less, not a minute more. Dithering, which costs $5/month, was previously available as a $3 add-on for Stratechery subscribers; now it is available to all Stratechery subscribers. You can get Dithering for Apple Podcasts, Overcast, or the podcast player of your choice by clicking the link at the top or bottom of this email, at the <a href="https://dithering.passport.online/member">Dithering website</a>.</p><hr /><p>This is, I hope, only the beginning for Stratechery Plus. Right now the content is obviously very Ben-centric, but my hope is to expand the offering over time. For now, I am delighted to be doing my part to make Stratechery more valuable than ever.</p>
