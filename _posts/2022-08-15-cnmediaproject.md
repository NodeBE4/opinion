Re "Whatever the full story behind the screen, these films and their puzzling promotional materials are clear examples of how Chinese attempts to engage with the world can be clumsy affairs. Forgoing transparency to appear credible, they ultimately achieve entirely the opposite."

Re Fascinating investigation by @schoenmakersk into a bizarre case of faking global influence for positive China content. . . Including fake festivals like the "Atlanta Award-Qualifying Festival," shown here with fake photo of a crowded theater.

Re Thanks to earlier spotters/reporters of this mystifying case, including @ktse852 and the Czech Republic's Deník N @enkocz.

RT Matthew Brooker<br>Re @cnmediaproject "The crew listed for “Spring, Seeing Hong Kong Again” consists of people whose involvement is questionable, who deny having worked on the film, or who can’t be found."<br><br>A bizarre and hilarious account that is full of lines like this

A long read that won't disappoint. Fake foreign film festivals. Applauding audiences that don't exist. Directors who promote, and then deny involvement. Producers invisible. You can't make up the mess that can come with "telling China's story well." <a href="https://bit.ly/3QI5HjN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3QI5HjN</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaL9UEnagAA45Zm?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Melissa Chan<br>Batshit story from @cnmediaproject about China's attempts setting up fake foreign film festivals to give its sketchy documentaries awards (a non-existent Prague film festival, a "Canadian" narrator with a Russian phone number who is actually named Sergei). <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/15/telling-chinas-story-poorly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/15/telling-chinas-story-poorly/</a>
