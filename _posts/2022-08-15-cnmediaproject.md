Re "Whatever the full story behind the screen, these films and their puzzling promotional materials are clear examples of how Chinese attempts to engage with the world can be clumsy affairs. Forgoing transparency to appear credible, they ultimately achieve entirely the opposite."

Including fake festivals like the "Atlanta Award-Qualifying Festival," shown here with fake photo of a crowded theater.

A long read that won't disappoint. Fake foreign film festivals. Applauding audiences that don't exist. Directors who promote, and then deny involvement. Producers invisible. You can't make up the mess that can come with "telling China's story well."‚ÄÇ<a href="https://bit.ly/3QI5HjN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3QI5HjN</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaL9UEnagAA45Zm?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT‚ÄÇDon Weinland<br>Re This is an excellent, often humorous piece by @cnmediaproject that ultimately raises questions over why people go through the trouble of making fake docs and film festivals that no one sees or attends
