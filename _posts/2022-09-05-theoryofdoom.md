### 371: [Why do some think Autism is a future stage in human evolution](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/x8jkp0/why_do_some_think_autism_is_a_future_stage_in/), submitted on 2022-09-08 07:10:54+08:00.

> I'm on the autism spectrum, and I have NEVER heard of autism described like that.

This is kind of an inside-baseball type controversy within the field of evolutionary psychology, for which there is little support.  

Here's the basic idea:  

There's an anomaly that puzzles scientists, from a genetic perspective.  On the one hand, there are combinations of genetic variations that are highly heritable.  On the other hand, individuals who exhibit those characteristics tend to exhibit low reproductive success (i.e., less likely to reproduce).  Yet, autism is on the rise.  Why might that be the case? 

Some [folks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.071) think that some of the genetic variations that might be associated with autism are driven by evolution.  For example, [some](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-24898-009) argue that because certain combinations of genetic variations associated with developing autism seem to be highly heritable, their spontaneous manifestation must be the result of some evolutionary push. 

How can this be explained?  Well, one way to look at it is by examining the subjects in whom symptoms of autism seem to be most prevalent. Which might be boys.  Or it might not be.  Who knows?  Certainly not evolutionary psychologists.   

There's a theory in evolutionary psychology which says that biological males exhibit [greater psychometric variability](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00096.x) in a normal distribution than biological females.  Basically, despite mean IQ-scale scores of 100 across a sample of males/females, modal scores were about 105 and even above modal level, males showed more variability than females.  Basically, boys are more likely to be over-represented on the top and bottom of the distribution than girls.  

Applying that idea to [autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277413/) gets us the so-called "extreme male brain" theory and its associated [pop sci nonsense](https://theconversation.com/how-our-autistic-ancestors-played-an-important-role-in-human-evolution-73477), that waxes philosophical on why stereotypically "autistic" traits may be favored from an evolutionary perspective.

But the research is weak.  It's speculation, based on inference drawn from conjecture from another field's guesswork.  And because it's weak, it's controversial.  One might even say a "fringe" position.

Ima be that guy . . . so what's on the shirt?

I've since listened to a couple of their songs, including [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GurkREc-q4I&ab_channel=CenturyMediaRecords).  Their style reminds me of [Nine Inch Nails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9BfvPjsXXw&ab_channel=NineInchNailsVEVO) meets [Ten Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBwjoy13wzU&ab_channel=10Years-Topic), in the style of [Evanescence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhqVtpR2ts&ab_channel=EvanescenceVEVO) and spirit of [Blue October](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JC7Wsp_3qI&ab_channel=BlueOctoberVEVO).

I've never had purple gin before.  Typically go for Plymouth Naval Strength.  But I'd be willing to try the purple gin.  What makes it purple? 

I also like to observe the vermouth from across the room while I drink my martini.  Churchill had the right idea.

----- __373.2__ -----2022-09-08 14:59:17+08:00:

Interesting.  I might try that. 

Unrelatedly, I like vermouth in a manhattan, ideally made with rye.  But bourbon would work too (although if I'm doing bourbon, I'd rather have an old fashioned, which does not include vermouth).  I'm less picky about whiskey than gin.
