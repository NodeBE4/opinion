拍攝日期：2023/12/11主講人：高嘉宏（台大醫院副院長）Advancements in investigative tools and electronic health records have ushered in a paradigm shift, moving away from guideline-specific therapies toward personalized precision medicine for patients. The wealth of multiparametric and detailed information available necessitates innovative analyses to gain insights into diseases, aiding in diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. In the field of hepatology, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection manifests as clinically heterogeneous outcomes globally. Previous molecular epidemiological studies have highlighted significant variations in the geographical distribution of HBV genotypes. Additionally, the frequency of mutants among these genotypes differs. The role of HBV genotypes/mutants in the pathogenesis of HBV infection and its natural history has gained increasing recognition. In patients with chronic hepatitis B, genotype C and D exhibit a higher frequency of basal core promoter A1762T/G1764A mutations compared to genotype A and B. Genotypes C, D, and F carry a heightened lifetime risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, unlike genotypes A and B. Mutations in the pre-S, core promoter, and X regions of HBV correlate with an increased risk of cirrhosis and HCC. Notably, HBV pre-S/S gene mutations have been associated with immune evasion from hepatitis B immunoglobulin or vaccine-induced immunity. In essence, HBV genotypes and mutants play a significant role in disease progression and the long-term outcomes of HBV infection. They can function as vital viral genetic markers for risk stratification in clinical practice, particularly for CHB patients. Looking ahead, future efforts should focus on establishing artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including machine learning and deep learning, for the precise management of chronic hepatitis B patients. Furthermore, novel HBV therapies should target integrated HBV DNA to reduce the risk of HCC in these patients.►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
