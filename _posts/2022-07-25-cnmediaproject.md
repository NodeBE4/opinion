Facing curbs on social media, Chinese users have long used creative wordplay to tiptoe around censorship. As platforms enforce their own word restrictions to hold on to traffic and hold off rivals, content creators have a whole new set of words to avoid. <a href="https://bit.ly/3PHXAUy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3PHXAUy</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYqdUjCaIAAkegq?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Don't You Dare Say "WeChat": Chinese internet users have long had to be creative with language to work around official censorship. Now some content creators are up in arms about intrusive blocks by platforms, often for purely commercial reasons. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/27/dont-you-dare-say-wechat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/27/dont-you-dare-say-wechat/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYtzU8vaIAA_Gbd?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Li Shanglong (李尚龙), an author and influencer, revealed on Weibo that he had received eight rule violation notices in a single day from the short video hosting platform Douyin, each resulting in the interruption of his live streams. His post brought a wave of discussion.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYtz1O-aUAEBiqh?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re According to Li, Douyin’s warnings cited “suspected backflow" (倒流) as the reason for interrupting his live streams. The term suggests in this case that Li might have been redirecting traffic to rival platforms such as WeChat by mentioning the platforms in his live streams.

Re When Li used the term “limited-time offer,” or miaosha (秒杀), during his live stream, he says he was slapped with a Douyin warning. He used the innocuous utterance “miao miao” (秒秒) instead.

Re When, later in his live stream, he mentioned the phrase “money making,” or zhuan qian (赚钱), the axe came down again. The phrase was apparently unacceptable, but he could use “making rice,” or zhuan mi (赚米), a colloquialism for making money.

Re Douyin alleged in a response that Li's statements were false, but the explanations failed to satisfy many internet users and content creators -- who said the account confirmed what everyone already knew from experience.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYt2OumacAAJUNr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re “This is the truth,” a user said in a comment under a post by IT Home. “And so many content creators [who are saying the same thing] aren’t idiots.” Online courses in China teach content creators how to live stream in ways that dodge censorship and work around platform standards.

Re @marchofer A good way to put it, actually. Authorities can talk about cleaning up an environment, safeguarding culture, and so on -- but such interventions become the culture.

On page 2 of yesterday's People's Daily, an interesting example of how Xi's title and leadership must be emphasized for every bit of "news." This might have been: "Xi Jinping signs 3 military orders." But no, each one must be stressed independently.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYzHnKeaAAA_ayo?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
