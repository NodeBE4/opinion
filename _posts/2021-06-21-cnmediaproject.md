RT StellaHongZhang<br>I may be stating the obvious but there is a stubborn view that the BRI is only about Chinese overseas finance & infrastructure projects. No, it involves a much wider array of activities than that, and we need a more sophisticated  system to measure both its "outputs" & "outcomes"<br><br>The People's Map of Global China: More than seven years since China launched its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a widely held view from the outside is that this endeavour has now slowed down. But is that really the case?

A recent speech by the head of China Media Group, the super-conglomerate directly under the CCP, suggests China is gearing up to further refine its external communication strategy. But can calls for "innovation" break free of one-size-fits-all thinking? <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/06/22/influencers-activists-and-diplomats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/06/22/influencers-activists-and-diplomats/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4erVlSWEAAGtcD?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
