### 172: [Russia seeks military equipment and aid from China, U.S. officials say](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tdnqkh/russia_seeks_military_equipment_and_aid_from/), submitted on 2022-03-14 11:11:12+08:00.

Submission Statement:  

This Washington Post article (hosted on Microsoft News) reports that Russia has sought military aid from China, including equipment.  China denies any such request was placed.  According to White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the Biden Administration is "communicating directly, privately" with Beijing on this matter and stated "that there will absolutely be consequences," but Sullivan failed to offer meaningful details on the same.

Trucks, generally, and fuel trucks, specifically, have been a big problem for Russia.  Logistics are their military's main issue.

Further Reading from the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-europe-china-d7cfda44db57c0ff19109d66ed876c6a):

> Biden administration officials say Beijing is spreading false Russian claims that Ukraine was running chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support. They say China is effectively providing cover if Russia moves ahead with a biological or chemical weapons attack on Ukrainians.

Submission Statement:

This article considers geopolitical shifts underway amid Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine: Putin's war has "re-drawn[]" the "energy and geopolitical map in Europe," in perhaps the most significant way since the USSR's collapse.  The EU has undertaken new effort to divest itself from Russia, the United States has acutely limited Russian oil imports and Saudi Arabia's importance to American geopolitical strategy is renewed once more.  China, however, continues to prove a ready and willing market for Russian petrochemical commodities.

### 174: [The Return of Pax Americana?: Putin’s War Is Fortifying the Democratic Alliance](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tdxfij/the_return_of_pax_americana_putins_war_is/), submitted on 2022-03-14 21:24:11+08:00.

----- __174.1__ -----2022-03-15 11:47:54+08:00:

Very little of this analysis is persuasive.  

Ukraine matters, for reasons I have previously stated.  Yet, the "international order" is not jeopardized by isolated conflicts between regional powers, even where one regional power is significantly more powerful than another.  

Russia's invading Ukraine is a regional military conflict.  Other actors may be indirectly involved to varying degrees (e.g., Belarus, for Russia; and other countries, to the extent their citizens have volunteered themselves for Ukraine's defense).  But this does not make a threat to the international order.  Putin is what he has always been, just as the international system exists in anarchy without American leadership.  To the extent there is a threat to the international order, it is the result of declining American leadership, after more than a decade of over-reach since 9/11.  

And in any case, there is no "fortifying" of any "alliiance," whether "democratic" or otherwise.  Ostensibly new ideas seek to replace any pax Americana that ever may have existed; dangerous ideas that mirror the ones which impelled the world to war in the last century.  Our institutions and their integrity are the price of the ideals currently being advertised, to reset the postwar way of doing things.  

Reading this article is like watching a poker player who missed his flush on the turn bluff his way through the river.

This would be better submitted in response to the article already approved which focuses on these issues.

----- __176.1__ -----2022-03-15 11:52:36+08:00:

Misleading, misinformation.  The era of pseudo-expertise found among Twitter-based COVID-speculation is over.
