### 172: [Russia seeks military equipment and aid from China, U.S. officials say](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tdnqkh/russia_seeks_military_equipment_and_aid_from/), submitted on 2022-03-14 11:11:12+08:00.

Submission Statement:  

This Washington Post article (hosted on Microsoft News) reports that Russia has sought military aid from China, including equipment.  China denies any such request was placed.  According to White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the Biden Administration is "communicating directly, privately" with Beijing on this matter and stated "that there will absolutely be consequences," but Sullivan failed to offer meaningful details on the same.

Trucks, generally, and fuel trucks, specifically, have been a big problem for Russia.  Logistics are their military's main issue.

Further Reading from the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-europe-china-d7cfda44db57c0ff19109d66ed876c6a):

Submission Statement:

This article considers geopolitical shifts underway amid Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine: Putin's war has "re-drawn[]" the "energy and geopolitical map in Europe," in perhaps the most significant way since the USSR's collapse.  The EU has undertaken new effort to divest itself from Russia, the United States has acutely limited Russian oil imports and Saudi Arabia's importance to American geopolitical strategy is renewed once more.  China, however, continues to prove a ready and willing market for Russian petrochemical commodities.

### 174: [The Return of Pax Americana?: Putin’s War Is Fortifying the Democratic Alliance](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tdxfij/the_return_of_pax_americana_putins_war_is/), submitted on 2022-03-14 21:24:11+08:00.

----- __174.1__ -----2022-03-15 11:47:54+08:00:

Very little of this analysis is persuasive.  

Ukraine matters, for reasons I have previously stated.  Yet, the "international order" is not jeopardized by isolated conflicts between regional powers, even where one regional power is significantly more powerful than another.  

Russia's invading Ukraine is a regional military conflict.  Other actors may be indirectly involved to varying degrees (e.g., Belarus, for Russia; and other countries, to the extent their citizens have volunteered themselves for Ukraine's defense).  But this does not make a threat to the international order.  Putin is what he has always been, just as the international system exists in anarchy without American leadership.  To the extent there is a threat to the international order, it is the result of declining American leadership, after more than a decade of over-reach since 9/11.  

And in any case, there is no "fortifying" of any "alliiance," whether "democratic" or otherwise.  Ostensibly new ideas seek to replace any pax Americana that ever may have existed; dangerous ideas that mirror the ones which impelled the world to war in the last century.  Our institutions and their integrity are the price of the ideals currently being advertised, to reset the postwar way of doing things.  

Reading this article is like watching a poker player who missed his flush on the turn bluff his way through the river.

### 179: [Xi Jinping’s Faltering Foreign Policy: The War in Ukraine and the Perils of Strongman Rule](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tfj6jl/xi_jinpings_faltering_foreign_policy_the_war_in/), submitted on 2022-03-16 22:40:51+08:00.

----- __179.1__ -----2022-03-17 12:18:43+08:00:

Perspectives such as those expressed in the article linked here give me pause.  I worry that some foreign policy stakeholders fail to understand how interests are perceived by their adversaries, which would result in avoidable strategic error. 

Basically, reading this article's "analysis" feels like sipping the kool-aid.  For example, the article argues:

> [T]he more powerful Xi becomes and the more direct authority he exerts over Beijing’s foreign policy, the more adverse the outcomes are for China’s long-term strategic interests.

* Criticism of Xi Jinping will always be well received here, however much it may replace facts with adjectives and reasons with innuendo.  And that isn't to say I disagree with all of those characterizations, because, as the author argues "Xi’s . . . support for Moscow" in invading Ukraine was a "major foreign policy misstep," to the extent it ran afoul of American interests.  But, whether that support was in Xi's long term best interests remains to be seen.  

* Further, Xi's "decision to retaliate against EU officials last March in response to sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang" did "cost Beijing a long-coveted investment deal with Europe," but so what?  There will be other deals. The repercussions for Xi's genocide in Xinjiang (costs imposed on him or China as a result) and with respect to the Uyghur Muslim population there (and the greater Uyghur diaspora) are miniscule in comparison to the scale and egregious nature of those human rights violations.  Xi clearly perceives that genocide to be in both his and China's interests, and has failed to change course as a result of any sanction imposed as a result, by any western actor.  To wit, nothing whatsoever has changed.  The genocide continues.  Emphasizing one allegedly "coveted" trade deal with Europe when the Biden administration will do little more than bark is reaching too far.  Counting the wins where they accrue is important, but tremendous work remains to be done.   

* Additionally, Xi's "threats toward Taiwan are," in fact "driving Washington and Taipei closer together and forcing other regional powers, such as Australia and Japan, to declare their own compelling interest in Taiwan’s security." But, consider that: (a) the "compelling" nature of that interest was already well established, (b) "declar[ing]" it now is unlikely to be perceived as anything other than what it is --- purely symbolic and (c) the only thing that matters is whether the United States is willing to prevent forcible reunification, and based on what Biden is allowing to happen in Ukraine now, Biden is clearly unwilling to do anything with the military whatsoever.

### 181: [The False Promise of Arming Insurgents: America’s Spotty Record Warrants Caution in Ukraine](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/th3svd/the_false_promise_of_arming_insurgents_americas/), submitted on 2022-03-18 23:21:42+08:00.

----- __181.1__ -----2022-03-19 14:01:24+08:00:

> I wrote an article in January where I reached that exact same conclusion.

Caution should be exercised for any strategy or method to pursue foreign policy objectives. But wholesale rejection of a method (arming opposition forces) based on purported failure "from Albania in the 1940s to Afghanistan in the 1980s" is unreasonable.  

The article alleges that "out of 35 U.S. attempts to covertly arm foreign dissidents during the Cold War, only four succeeded in bringing U.S. allies to power."  I am only left to guess what that means, but at least these points should be obvious: regime change is rarely the goal and even if it was, "bringing . . . allies to power" involves considerably more than placing arms in the hands of some opposition force.  

Considerably more "attempts" to place weapons in the hands of the USSR's enemies occurred during the Cold War.  Nearly all such instances were oriented towards something other than regime change, but to prevent foreseeable massacres by more powerful actors. 

At the time, I argued against arming anyone in Syria, despite considerable domestic political support for doing so.  There, other means were better suited towards achieving American objectives (at least to the extent the foreseeable costs of pursuing them were justified by probable benefits).  

Furnishing arms, as was considered at that time, involved uncertain and potentially incalculably high risk with almost no greater benefit than less precarious alternatives.  But Black market sales weren't the concern there.  Nor are they ever really a concern, because it is logistically impractical to try to prevent it.  Future misuse or misappropriation are just inherent risks.  

In any event, Ukraine is not Syria.  Regime change is not the desired end for anyone, other than Vladimir Putin.  No appropriate analogy can be drawn to any case of Cold War appropriations to anti-Soviet opposition or insurgency.  There is an appropriate analogy to be drawn, however, to Bosnia.  There, earlier intervention might have shortened the conflict duration and resulted in fewer casualties in the long run.

You should submit some kind of original post explaining why you think this speech is relevant to Ukraine today, link the video and analyze it.  But you currently have no submission statement and just linking the video isn't enough.
