RT Melissa Chan<br>Everybody is sharing that one essay from one Chinese dude, clinging on to it with hope it is some harbinger of shifting Chinese policy. There is no shift in Chinese policy until they stop copy/pasting Russian propaganda and feeding it into their domestic media pipeline.

A US-China meet in Rome today could be key to securing peace in Europe. But the top story in the CCP's flagship paper today is the glorious closing ceremony of the Paralympic Winter Games. Much to read between the lines in this act of incredible myopia. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNzRnzwakAQJpo0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Not a whiff in the PD today on the Rome meeting between top US and Chinese diplomats. Meanwhile, a foreign affairs column heaps blame on the US, accusing it of "disinformation."

Re @WendyZhou502 @CarlMinzner @JohnDelury @Dali_Yang @UselessTree @MariaRepnikova @dong_mengyu @ashleyesarey This raises interesting questions about where we should be looking for changes in "tone."

Re @CarlMinzner @JohnDelury @Dali_Yang @UselessTree @MariaRepnikova @WendyZhou502 @dong_mengyu @ashleyesarey Always perilous (caveat) to read straight strategy into moves, but if we were to try, might there not be attempts to prepare the way for tonal changes at the top, for example, by cooling discussion on social media that would create dissonance? Tone change not flipping a switch.

Page 4 of today's People's Daily has an article on "ideological and political education" (思政), education in the CCP political line for high school and university students -- which has blossomed in the Xi era. <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-03/18/nw.D110000renmrb_20220318_3-04.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-03/18/nw.D110000renmrb_20220318_3-04.htm</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOGGbVFakAE6Y7t?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re PD: By the end of 2021, China had 127,000+ full-time and part-time "sizheng" teachers in colleges and universities. Nearly 78% are under 49 years old and 35% have senior roles. 41 national training bases and 32 prep centers train 6,000 new teachers a year.

Another note for discourse watchers. Premier Li is on the front page of PD today with "important written comments" on forest fire prevention.

While US focusses on Putin's international isolation, China seeks to shift focus to the question of US bioweapons in Ukraine – based only on Russian claims from March 6. The result is a rift in public priorities that mirrors US-China tensions. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/18/china-doubles-down-on-us-bioweapons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/18/china-doubles-down-on-us-bioweapons/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOGvRX4akAYE5Cu?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Caution is in order as many observe a change in "tone" in the Chinese media regarding Ukraine. This is not a simple flip of the switch -- even if we see more attention to Ukraine. 2 top stories on Xinhua right now . . . .<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOIfzPaaIAoItjr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 1) is about more than 300 US DOD bio labs worldwide including Ukraine, and need for US transparency given threat to the world; and 2) is about how as Ukrainians suffer China is providing what's needed (food and blankets) while the US is feeding the conflict with weapons.
