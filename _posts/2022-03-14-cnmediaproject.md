RT Melissa Chan<br>Everybody is sharing that one essay from one Chinese dude, clinging on to it with hope it is some harbinger of shifting Chinese policy. There is no shift in Chinese policy until they stop copy/pasting Russian propaganda and feeding it into their domestic media pipeline.

A US-China meet in Rome today could be key to securing peace in Europe. But the top story in the CCP's flagship paper today is the glorious closing ceremony of the Paralympic Winter Games. Much to read between the lines in this act of incredible myopia. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNzRnzwakAQJpo0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re No talk of the challenges facing the world, lots on the glories of the host country, 18 gold medals, proof of "China’s human rights protection." The only foreign affairs reference was the anthem "Peace: Community of Destiny" (和平 – 命运共同体) as Xi took the stage.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNzTDpqaAAQjEJ6?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Not a whiff in the PD today on the Rome meeting between top US and Chinese diplomats. Meanwhile, a foreign affairs column heaps blame on the US, accusing it of "disinformation." Publicly at least, US and China views of the Ukraine war are world’s apart. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/15/50501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/15/50501/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FN20svmaIAQXH3S?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The report on Rome centers on Taiwan and China's assertion that the US has upheld the One-China policy in principle but undermined it in action; and on Xinjiang and Tibet as "internal affairs" of China.

China’s annual “two sessions" (两会) are not just about introducing policy decisions and new legislative proposals. They are seen by the government and official state media as a key time to deliver China’s propaganda message overseas.
