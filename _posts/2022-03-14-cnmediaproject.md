RT Melissa Chan<br>Everybody is sharing that one essay from one Chinese dude, clinging on to it with hope it is some harbinger of shifting Chinese policy. There is no shift in Chinese policy until they stop copy/pasting Russian propaganda and feeding it into their domestic media pipeline.

A US-China meet in Rome today could be key to securing peace in Europe. But the top story in the CCP's flagship paper today is the glorious closing ceremony of the Paralympic Winter Games. Much to read between the lines in this act of incredible myopia. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNzRnzwakAQJpo0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re No talk of the challenges facing the world, lots on the glories of the host country, 18 gold medals, proof of "China’s human rights protection." The only foreign affairs reference was the anthem "Peace: Community of Destiny" (和平 – 命运共同体) as Xi took the stage.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNzTDpqaAAQjEJ6?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Carl Minzner<br>It includes this doozy: "人民领袖爱人民，人民领袖人民爱" (The People's Leader loves the people, the people love the People's Leader)<br><br>Feels like that must have some direct Maoist roots – anyone know more about the historical origins of that phrase?<br><br>Carl Minzner: Nice catch by @theChinaDude - this 3/13 @PDChina article uses the Maoist term "People's Leader" 8 times to refer to Xi Jinping.<br> <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-03/13/nw.D110000renmrb_20220313_1-02.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-03/13/nw.D110000renmrb_20220313_1-02.htm</a>
