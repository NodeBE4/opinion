RT Melissa Chan<br>Everybody is sharing that one essay from one Chinese dude, clinging on to it with hope it is some harbinger of shifting Chinese policy. There is no shift in Chinese policy until they stop copy/pasting Russian propaganda and feeding it into their domestic media pipeline.

A US-China meet in Rome today could be key to securing peace in Europe. But the top story in the CCP's flagship paper today is the glorious closing ceremony of the Paralympic Winter Games. Much to read between the lines in this act of incredible myopia. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/14/an-anthem-for-the-new-era/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNzRnzwakAQJpo0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Not a whiff in the PD today on the Rome meeting between top US and Chinese diplomats. Meanwhile, a foreign affairs column heaps blame on the US, accusing it of "disinformation."

Re @CarlMinzner @JohnDelury @Dali_Yang @UselessTree @MariaRepnikova @WendyZhou502 @dong_mengyu @ashleyesarey Always perilous (caveat) to read straight strategy into moves, but if we were to try, might there not be attempts to prepare the way for tonal changes at the top, for example, by cooling discussion on social media that would create dissonance?
