   obile Augmented Reality (MAR) is widely regarded as one of the most promising technologies in the next ten years. With MAR, we are able to blend information from our senses and mobile devices in myriad ways that were not possible before. The way to supplement the real world other than to replace real world with an artificial environment makes it especially preferable for applications such as tourism, navigation, entertainment, advertisement, and education. In this talk, I will first give an overview of the MAR research in our HKUST-DT System and Media Lab and then I will use two systems that we have developed as examples to illustrate the research challenges that we have to face for our research. These two MAR systems are Ubii – Ubiquitous Interface for Seamless Interaction between Digital and Physical Worlds, and Hyperion – A Wearable Augmented Reality System for Text Extraction and Manipulation in the Air. I will go through them in details.
