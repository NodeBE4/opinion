### 536: [This is too funny. The Hong Kong protesters are saying 'Free Hong Kong' so the pro Beijing trolls are shouting 'Free China'. I agree, it would be awesome to free china!](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/ct5bxt/this_is_too_funny_the_hong_kong_protesters_are/), submitted on 2019-08-21 04:12:24+08:00.

That's a question I wanted to ask for a long time

When people shouting *free HK* or *free tibet/xinjiang/taiwan*

Do they usually mean *letting them have more freedom* or *being independent from (mainland) China*?

It seems that both translations are right, but I would like to know the **feeling** from a native speaker
