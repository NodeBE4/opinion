In much of the world, digital literacy centers on giving citizens the knowledge and attitudes needed to be safe and empowered in cyberspace. In China, related initiatives are enmeshed with a far more basic goal: ideological and political control. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXgV9dhaIAAjQGT?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re @wmdglasgow @crikey_news Sun Wanning's essay certainly invites thought and reflection. But the talk of "intended meaning" invites unease. How, other than through the substance of China's language as sometimes purred to global audiences and screamed to domestic audiences, are we to read this meaning?
