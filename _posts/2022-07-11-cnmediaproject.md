RT Jennifer Zeng 曾錚<br>This is huge. Don't know how this will end. Henan bank is NOT the only one that is having problems with liquidity. All four Chinese banks are having the same issue. Some depositors found they can save and can NOT withdraw money with their bank cards. <br>#bankrun #China #CCP<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1546167791685885952/pu/vid/1280x720/4GGPD4oJZpmVr4Ea.mp4?tag=12" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1546167791685885952/pu/img/-1Jdnr76AJ4kiEQ5.jpg"></video>

Re This is a fascinating inside look at media projects, business models and how talented Chinese teams navigate a tough environment to determine what can and can't be done: "In these kinds of cases, you are bound to fall into the challenge or trap of self-censorship."

For those who missed it: CMP's must-read on the CCP's not-so-secret system of pen names for powerful people and ministries. Important knowledge for those reading Chinese politics through the media. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/06/23/pen-names-for-power-struggles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/06/23/pen-names-for-power-struggles/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXbvxRSagAAhewR?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

In much of the world, digital literacy centers on giving citizens the knowledge and attitudes needed to be safe and empowered in cyberspace. In China, related initiatives are enmeshed with a far more basic goal: ideological and political control. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXgV9dhaIAAjQGT?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re An event last year in a digital literacy education classroom in Chongqing focussed on that issue vexing all loving parents concerned about their child’s online habits: the centennial of the Chinese Communist Party.

Re CMP's post today is important context as China hosts its World Internet Conference (WIC) this week on the theme of building a "community of shared future in cyberspace." While priorities certainly can overlap, China's core values here have important differences.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXgXjEOacAAdxfr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
