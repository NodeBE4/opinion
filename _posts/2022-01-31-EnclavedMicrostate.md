This submission has been removed because it violates our ['20-Year Rule'](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events). To discourage off-topic discussions of current events, questions, answers, and all other comments must be confined to events that happened 20 years ago or more.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to /r/PoliticalScience.

If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.

### 106: [Questions about the Taiping movement](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseHistory/comments/sgpb8v/questions_about_the_taiping_movement/), submitted on 2022-01-31 10:02:00+08:00.

----- __106.1__ -----2022-01-31 12:00:46+08:00:

1:

Confucianism yes, hierarchy no. The Taiping, at least in their earlier years (to be honest, the analysis of change over time of Taiping ideology has never been that good), were not necessarily out to destroy the entire Chinese classical canon. Rather, they accepted the validity and primacy of the Five Classics, but considered the (Neo-)Confucian interpretation of that canon, i.e. the Four Books and associated derivations, to be corruptions of an originally 'pure' message. So for instance the supposedly egalitarian programme of land and resource distribution expressed in the *Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty* actually cribs from the *Book of Rites*. This programme, by the by, would have been *immensely* hierarchical if implemented, with all households organised as though part of armies, and the households of privates subordinated to those of various ascending ranks of officer. The saving grace, so to speak, for anyone under such a system would have been the regularity of promotions and, if warranted, demotions, that would keep people moving through the ranks on a nominally meritocratic basis.

Of course, in parallel with what we might term Taiping anti-traditionalism, there was also a particularly violent strain of anti-Manchuism as well, as with later political upheavals in the late Qing. It would be reductionist to assert that either anti-traditionalism or anti-Manchuism were the *sole* cause of any of these upheavals.

2:

I mean, yes and no, in that it depends what you define 'proto-Marxist' as, not least given that Marxism stipulates a transition to capitalism in between feudalism and socialism. But if we use the *Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty* as our interpretive guide here, the Taiping were not aiming to establish true communal ownership as such or of worker-owned industry, because they ultimately did not intend to abolish the state nor, at least to begin with, to industrialise. Instead they were advocating a heavily planned and centralised agrarian economy.

3:

You can definitely argue that the period between the Taiping and the establishment of the PRC was one in which the working class in China proper had not seen much significant improvement in quality of life, but I don't necessarily see the value or usefulness of such a comparison given the nearly century-length gap.

----- __106.2__ -----2022-01-31 20:45:11+08:00:

I am not published, no.

As for Marx, he did have some thoughts on the Taiping, although there hasn't really been a consolidated discussion of them anywhere. Some excerpted quotations can be found in Stephen Platt's *Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom* and you can also find a discussion of his 1853 article on the Taiping [here](https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2009/02/marx-and-taipings0.html). Broadly speaking he didn't really view the Taiping as a class revolution within China, so much as a reaction to Western imperialism.

----- __106.3__ -----2022-02-01 03:00:53+08:00:

> that seems to obviate the peasant component in chinese communism and the peasant movement that was the backbone of the party after 1927.

I don't believe I disputed either of these. Rather, I stated, with regard to issue 2, that the Taiping did not in any way espouse an end goal of transitioning beyond the state as per 'orthodox' Marxism, and with regard to issue 3, that the 'secular vestigial pre-disposition' aspect was not at all defined, and would imply a continuity of conditions between 1850 and 1949 that I would not see as sustainable.

----- __106.4__ -----2022-02-01 10:50:29+08:00:

This seems entirely to be confrontation for confrontation's sake, over terms in the question that we *both* saw as ambiguous and therefore had our own interpretations of.

When the question asks if the Taiping were proto-Marxist, I did not interpret that as meaning proto-Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, nor did I operate on the presumption that we ought to accept Marx's schema dividing between European and non-European polities. When the question asks if there was some fundamental underlying continuity that lay behind both the Taiping and the Chinese Communists, I suggested that while on the one hand the Chinese working classes (are peasants not a working class?) did indeed not see any comparable enfranchisement between the conditions leading to the rise of the Taiping (hence 1850) and to the victory of the Communists (hence 1949). *Between* meaning *all the hundred-ish years encompassed between the two*. But at the same time there were broader conditions that were distinct – a limited degree of industrialisation, and also the end of Qing rule which removed a key racial/ethnic dimension as a cause of political tension.
