### 39: [Why Nobody Invests in Japan: Tokyo’s Failure to Welcome Foreign Capital Is Hobbling Its Economy](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/q8ouyb/why_nobody_invests_in_japan_tokyos_failure_to/), submitted on 2021-10-15 21:50:24+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Richard Katz, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.\]

Foreign direct investment (FDI) allows the fresh ideas of foreign companies to spill over into the broader economy, boosting the performance of their local suppliers, business customers, and sometimes even their own competitors. For example, when Japanese automakers brought “transplant” factories to North America, Detroit learned that it cost less to prevent defects in the first place than to fix them afterward.  
Only one major country has said “no, thank you” to these benefits: Japan. In 2019 (the latest data available), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) ranked 196 countries in terms of cumulative inward FDI as a share of GDP. Japan came in dead last—just behind North Korea.
