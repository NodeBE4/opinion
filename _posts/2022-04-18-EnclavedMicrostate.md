**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 353: [While the modern consensus is that the Kamakura Shogunate was founded in 1185, it seems like there have been a number of alternate dates proposed such as 1183 and 1192. What basis has been given for these various dates, and why has 1185 won out?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u67lkt/while_the_modern_consensus_is_that_the_kamakura/), submitted on 2022-04-18 15:46:41+08:00.

Thank you! This perhaps goes a little beyond the immediate scope of the original question, but your description of the somewhat fractured state of power during the formation of the Kamakura government led me to have some questions about how both imperial and bakufu power ought to be conceptualised. To boil it down to a core question, to what extent should we conceptualise Japan in the Kamakura period as a unitary state? My only vague familiarity with Japanese domestic history being the late Edo, I apologise if I'm framing things very badly, but were there regional lords, particularly in the west, who saw themselves as part of the empire in the sense that they recognised the supremacy of the imperial court, but as essentially autonomous of the bakufu in Kamakura which they saw as directly governing a separate entity, but wielding a certain hegemonic power over lesser regional rulers?

> Also i think like most of holoEN is not an active vtuber before. There's a couple who try vtubing probably a couple times but Bae is an exeption.

That's not entirely correct. I did a quick check and of 11 members of HoloEN, 8 had some kind of prior VTubing experience, to varying degrees of recognition.

### 355: [[Noel] Danchou has defeated Malenia! In A Cave! With a Pair of Clubs!](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/u74hq2/noel_danchou_has_defeated_malenia_in_a_cave_with/), submitted on 2022-04-19 20:54:47+08:00.

Can't argue with that!

Well, to be pedantic, Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal did, given it's a guest comic.

### 357: [Who’s your Oshi & why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/u75hnw/whos_your_oshi_why/), submitted on 2022-04-19 21:43:32+08:00.

Without a doubt, Calli. I do have a good chunk of favourites whom I'll put on consistently, but Calli is about the only one I would say I watch religiously. I think the main thing is there's just such an earnestness to how she presents herself on stream and in her music, even amid all the general VTuber kayfabe. I'm sure I'm not alone in having been introduced to Hololive via her first appearance on Trash Taste, but I also stayed because of her streams rather than those of other Holomems. That's not to say I don't or haven't ever liked any of the others – I actually started out watching Kiara more than I did Calli, and got into HoloJP via Nene (albeit ultimately to settle on Noel as my JP oshi). But it is to say I just enjoy Calli's content the most consistently of all. The fact she streams at a good time for me also helps a lot.

### 359: [Making memes until HoloMyth and Area 15 either appear in HoloGra, or get their own version. Day 32 - Time to shatter your perception of time again](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/u83ndc/making_memes_until_holomyth_and_area_15_either/), submitted on 2022-04-21 02:55:07+08:00.

I mean, given the Ottoman sultans claimed the title of *Kayser-i-Rum* until the 18th century, you could argue the Roman Empire was still in existence by that stage.
