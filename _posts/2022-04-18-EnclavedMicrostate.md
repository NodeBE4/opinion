Thank you! This perhaps goes a little beyond the immediate scope of the original question, but your description of the somewhat fractured state of power during the formation of the Kamakura government led me to have some questions about how both imperial and bakufu power ought to be conceptualised. To boil it down to a core question, to what extent should we conceptualise Japan in the Kamakura period as a unitary state? My only vague familiarity with Japanese domestic history being the late Edo, I apologise if I'm framing things very badly, but were there regional lords, particularly in the west, who saw themselves as part of the empire in the sense that they recognised the supremacy of the imperial court, but as essentially autonomous of the bakufu in Kamakura which they saw as directly governing a separate entity, but wielding a certain hegemonic power over lesser regional rulers?

I'd presume Miori still owns her character IP given she bought it off MyHolo when she graduated, so she definitely can continue as an indie if Tsunderia does fall through. I'm not entirely sure on Holo tbh, partly because she did apparently drop quite a bit of money on being able to continue using the Miori Celesta assets, and partly because one of her MyHolo genmates is also there now and I feel there's a possibility that that might prove to be an issue, either from her end or from Cover's. Cover hasn't necessarily avoided overt 'nepotism hires' as such (IIRC all three of Gamers were just friends of Fubuki who got in purely by invitation) but management seems to actively try to avoid reuniting past lives as such – most notably, Omaru Polka has never collabed with Tamaki (context with 'forbidden knowledge': >!Polka's talent is a good friend of Norio Tsukudani's and some of her last streams as Oda Nobuhime at upd8 were with Tamaki.!<) And I don't know how tenable it would be to end up with two former genmates from the same agency in separate gens and either having to interact with a different dynamic or even not at all.

I'd like to concur with the other comments so far in that I'm not sure the magic was ever in collabs outside the agency, and I'd also concur with /u/Seijass that there are also some corporate reputations on the line. There are comments on the linked clip about Cover wanting to protect its own brand, which is true enough, but there's also another elephant in the room: no VTuber company has done quite as much as Cover to burn its bridges in China. Now, that doesn't apply as strongly for indies that might want to collab, or for Western agencies like VShojo, but for most JP agencies, collabs with HoloPro become a bit of a double-edged sword, especially for those with a significant hand in the Chinese market. This is especially true for Nijisanji: whereas HoloCN was always a small side project for Cover, a quarter of Anycolor's talents are part of its Chinese arm, VirtuaReal. That's at least 50 people (not counting staff) whose livelihoods and public images rest on Anycolor not becoming *persona non grata* on the Chinese internet the way Cover did back in 2020. A collab here and there is normal and understandable; but regular collabs may be taken by enough angry nationalists as enough of an intimation of collusion that it could cause a cascading PR nightmare.

It's definitely not some kind of hard barrier, but I'd argue it's a bit of a soft cap: it's important to note that the 2020 'Taiwan Incident' was not even the first time there'd been mention of contentious issues relating to Chinese imperialism/nationalism, as there had been a number of mentions of Taiwan, Tibet, and HK in the past that the fanbase had excused. Instead it ended up being a sort of last straw moment for some in relation to what had appeared to be Cover's blasé attitude towards the 'feelings of the Chinese people', and the angrier parts of the CN fanbase started riling up the more moderate ones, not-too-coincidentally against Coco, HoloJP's most overtly Western talent.

So it's not that Nijisanji *can't* collab with Holo because of its Chinese branch, because even the Chinese fanbase has to concede that you cannot ignore the other biggest agency outright. But I'd argue that there's potentially a soft limit to how far and how consistently this collaboration can go.

Just as a quick note, I mean to be explanatory rather than accusatory:

Given IRyS' past life as an utaite, her main schtick has always been singing other people's songs rather than writing her own, and she was almost certainly hired off the basis of her voice and not her songwriting. That's not to say she *isn't* a good songwriter but we legitimately don't know, as you note. Because yeah I agree, her singing is fantastic, and to be honest I think the compositions are at least decent, but the lyrics fall a bit flat. I don't know if anyone else gets this, but there tends to be a frequent tendency to have some awkward phrasing and especially em*pha*sis on the wrong syl*lab*le, to steal a phrase from Dan Olson.

> Also i think like most of holoEN is not an active vtuber before. There's a couple who try vtubing probably a couple times but Bae is an exeption.

That's not entirely correct. I did a quick check and of 11 members of HoloEN, 8 had some kind of prior VTubing experience, to varying degrees of recognition.

----- __355.2__ -----2022-04-21 08:00:55+08:00:

I mean sure, let's discount >!Senzawa!< then for only very intermittently using a VTuber model, and by that same criterion Ina/>!Nagu, who seems to only have only one known stream with a VTuber model, wouldn't count either.!< But even then, 6 out of 11 members had active VTuber presences before debuting with Hololive:

* Ame/>!sachiowo was definitely an active VTuber on Twitch.!<

* IRyS/>!namirin debuted a VTuber model in February 2021 and streamed relatively frequently with it, although she's wiped most of them besides her debut and hiatus announcement streams. Granted, VSinger auditions had closed by this point, so technically she wasn't a VTuber at the time she auditioned, but we also don't know when she was formally hired.!<

* Fauna/>!LemonLeaf was an active VTuber on Twitch, beginning in May 2020 with a redebut in February 2021.!<

* Mumei/>!Shachimu debuted her VTuber model in February 2021 and there are plenty of clips of that.!<

* Kronii/>!Seru Kisen was actively part of a small agency, Virtuality Project, having debuted in March 2021.!<

* Bae we're both on the same page on already.

I'll grant that a lot of them had only recently started VTubing at the time of auditioning – or indeed started during the wait period between auditions and confirmation – but still, over 50% had been active as VTubers for some months before debuting under HoloEN.

Without a doubt, Calli. I do have a good chunk of favourites whom I'll put on consistently, but Calli is about the only one I would say I watch religiously. I think the main thing is there's just such an earnestness to how she presents herself on stream and in her music, even amid all the general VTuber kayfabe. I'm sure I'm not alone in having been introduced to Hololive via her first appearance on Trash Taste, but I also stayed because of her streams rather than those of other Holomems. That's not to say I don't or haven't ever liked any of the others – I actually started out watching Kiara more than I did Calli, and got into HoloJP via Nene (albeit ultimately to settle on Noel as my JP oshi). But it is to say I just enjoy Calli's content the most consistently of all. The fact she streams at a good time for me also helps a lot.

----- __363.1__ -----2022-04-21 23:24:40+08:00:

The Qing queue edict was not simply a means of designating those who might be politically untrustworthy; violation of it was a capital crime. If you grew your forehead hair out except for a handful of special dispensations such as being in mourning, then you were publicly declaring yourself an enemy of the state and would be executed with little fanfare. The reason outlaws had no problem growing out their hair was, well, in the name – these were people living outside the law, aware of the consequences of being caught. I discuss the queue edict at greater length in these two past posts:

* [TUESDAY TRIVIA: "A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life" (Coco Chanel)- why don't you change our lives a bit with some fascinating discussion of the HISTORY OF HAIR!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hieo21/tuesday_trivia_a_woman_who_cuts_her_hair_is_about/fwh86bf/)

* [Since men were, at one point, required to wear the queue hairstyle in China, at the threat of execution, were aging and balding men executed or otherwise punished for failing to comply?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mi00dd/since_men_were_at_one_point_required_to_wear_the/gt2bimi/)

As I allude in those posts, the 1860s would, frankly, have been an *especially* bad time to suddenly develop a predilection for Han hairstyles given that several rebellions – many still in progress – had broken out whose participants signified their allegiance by their defiance of the queue edict. Chief among these were the Taiping, whose association with this was so strong they were known to their enemies as *changmao* 長毛 – literally, the 'Long Hairs'. Having the wrong hairstyle in the wrong place would literally get you killed; when travelling from one area of control to the other it was often necessary to shave to enter Qing territory – and often to have to spend time tanning to mask the obvious tanline from having shaved too recently – or to spend time growing one's hair out to enter Taiping lands. Making the wrong choice about one's hair at the wrong time was fatal. Moreover, for the purposes of our hypothetical 1860s nativist, the Qing sometimes offered cash bounties for severed rebel heads, with the size of the bounty scaling with the length of the forehead hair (5 inches being the maximum). If you, a Han man in a Qing-held city in 1860s China, chose to grow your hair out, *you were going to die.*

### 364: [What happened to anti-Christian sentiment in China that the Christian Sun Yat-sen was able to become President of China just 10 years after the Boxer Rebellion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u8rtzf/what_happened_to_antichristian_sentiment_in_china/), submitted on 2022-04-22 00:41:29+08:00.

----- __364.1__ -----2022-04-22 14:41:11+08:00:

The short answer to this is that China is *big*, but that's perhaps not the level of nuance one would hope for an AskHistorians answer in this day and age. In order to really grasp what was going on, we need to understand the Boxers – themselves somewhat divided between the Shandong and Zhili Boxers – and the Republican movement as distinct entities with distinct areas of appeal, both geographically and demographically, as well as quite distinct motives.

The Shandong Boxers were certainly anti-Christian, but arguably not anti-Christianity, at least not in any theological sense. The Boxer movement in Shandong had been largely the product of long-tern tensions within Shandong specifically, and related largely to the more pragmatic dimensions of how missions interacted with local society. In order to limit tensions with foreign powers, Qing authorities in the region had historically been relatively lenient towards missionaries for fear of provoking an international incident, and their converts, by implication, ostensibly ended up covered under a similar umbrella. There came to be a persistent rumour among non-converts that petty criminals and small-time bandits were converting to Christianity to essentially gain diplomatically-backed immunity from prosecution, which helped stoke animosity and fuelled the rise of anti-Christian movements like the Big Sword Society. However, this growth was also partly the product of economic stress in Shandong in conjunction with relatively weak local government, which made conditions ripe for the establishment and expansion of mutual aid groups, which on the one hand included the 'secret societies', but on the other also included the Christian missions, thereby further pushing the cycle along.

The Zhili Boxers were a much more abruptly formed movement, with 'Boxerism' so to speak having been imported from Shandong in late 1899 as Yuan Shikai, recently appointed as governor of Shandong, started actively hunting down Boxer cells and driving practitioners northwards. Whereas the Shandong Boxers were somewhat of an organic product of long-term local conditions, the Boxers in Zhili gained their support from much more immediate, but still largely local concerns. Chief among these was a period of drought in the region that the Zhili Boxers blamed on spiritual pollution in the form of the presence of foreign missionaries and their Chinese converts. This was a much more spiritually-motivated objection than had been the case in Shandong, but one that was no more theological: it didn't have anything to do with any specific precepts of Christianity, but rather the perceived implications of their physical presence.

Looking at the Boxer movement as a whole, this was a phenomenon whose purchase was primarily among rural communities in northern China, and related primarily to the local implications of foreign missionary activity, rather than a regional manifestation of a China-wide state of general anti-Christian sentimetn. Moreover, it is important to understand that the Boxers were a pro-Qing force [(though what exactly 'pro-Qing' meant in 1900 was a little uncertain owing to a recent coup and ongoing succession crisis)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q9pvuv/why_did_the_qing_government_support_the_boxers/hgysbu9/). Supporters of the Boxers in 1900 would be highly unlikely to support the revolution in 1911, irrespective of their location. Indeed, supporters of the Boxers in 1900 were not particularly numerous, either: several Qing provinces refused to support the court in its war against the foreign powers, with reformist elements of the government such as Li Honghang, Zhang Zhidong, and Yuan Shikai all overtly opposing the Boxer movement.

The republican movement could not have been any more different from the Boxers if it had tried. For one, it was vehemently anti-Qing: as the 'republican' label suggests, it had no interest whatever in compromising with the Qing, unlike the comparably radical Constitutionalist movement. For another, its demographic makeup was essentially the opposite of the Boxers': whereas the Boxers appealed mainly to the rural poor of northern China, the republicans, and their Constitutionalist rivals, were overwhelmingly from southern China, especially Guangdong, and they were broadly urban and skewed wealthy. On the republican side, Sun Yat-Sen was from a modest rural background, but spent many of his formative years in Honolulu supported by a relatively well-off brother and subsequently moved to Hong Kong, where he founded his Revive China Society; on the Constitutionalist side, the movement's founder Kang Youwei was from the mid-sized Cantonese city of Foshan (or Fatshan), and later moved mainly between Guangzhou (Canton), Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing, followed by protegés such as Liang Qichao. After the Qing cracked down on these movements, their leaders operated mainly as emigrés, schmoozing for support in Japan, the United States, and the European empires. In short, these were people who were well-educated, well-connected, relatively well-off, and, ultimately, well-travelled.

They were also, it must be noted, not really the people who started the revolution. Sun Yat-Sen's Tongmenghui, or Revolutionary Alliance, had some cells in east-central China at the time of the Wuchang Uprising, but it had historically focussed its efforts on Guangdong and was utterly unprepared for the sudden spate of popular uprisings and military mutinies that swept the Yangtze beginning in October 1911. The mutiny in Wuchang had coalesced around secret revolutionary cells, yes, but these were cells that had emerged organically within the New Army with no serious connection to the emigré agitators. Sun Yat-Sen had been fundraising in Colorado when the mutinies began, and would not arrive in China until 21 December. By this stage the Wuchang revolutionaries, led by Li Yuanhong, had already made a ceasefire with the imperial loyalists some two weeks earlier, and were in the middle of negotiations with Yuan Shikai to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to both the revolutionary and reformist camps. Sun's election as President of the Republic of China in Nanjing on 29 December was a largely symbolic gesture that has been interpreted a few ways, but he almost certainly did not expect to retain the post – he simply lacked significant credibility in the Yangtze valley outside a segment of the urban middle class concentrated in Shanghai, and moreover he lacked an army. One of his allies, Huang Xing, had managed to insert himself into a position of high military command in Wuchang off the back of support from the pro-Tongmenghui leadership of the revolutionaries in Shanghai, but was unable to entirely sideline Li Yuanhong, who officially remained 'vice-generalissimo' and would end up assuming the post of Vice-President when Sun was elected President.

Now, that said, I have rather quietly elided over the fact that Li Yuanhong himself was also Christian, but that is because in the context of 1911 Wuchang, that really wasn't a big deal. The Yangtze valley region, historically lumped under south China, was simply not economically or demographically equivalent to Shandong and Zhili; there had been no Boxer presence there, nor indeed any other form of widespread, organised anti-Christian movement, in the years prior. The anti-Christianity of the Boxers had, in any case, been a temporary response to specifically local issues, and was not reflective of longer-term trends in China as a whole as regards the Han Chinese population's relationship to Christianity.

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 368: [How much would historical warfare be affected by current era knowledge and tactics bereft of the technology?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u93xx4/how_much_would_historical_warfare_be_affected_by/), submitted on 2022-04-22 10:24:40+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).
