Thank you! This perhaps goes a little beyond the immediate scope of the original question, but your description of the somewhat fractured state of power during the formation of the Kamakura government led me to have some questions about how both imperial and bakufu power ought to be conceptualised. To boil it down to a core question, to what extent should we conceptualise Japan in the Kamakura period as a unitary state? My only vague familiarity with Japanese domestic history being the late Edo, I apologise if I'm framing things very badly, but were there regional lords, particularly in the west, who saw themselves as part of the empire in the sense that they recognised the supremacy of the imperial court, but as essentially autonomous of the bakufu in Kamakura which they saw as directly governing a separate entity, but wielding a certain hegemonic power over lesser regional rulers?

I'd presume Miori still owns her character IP given she bought it off MyHolo when she graduated, so she definitely can continue as an indie if Tsunderia does fall through. I'm not entirely sure on Holo tbh, partly because she did apparently drop quite a bit of money on being able to continue using the Miori Celesta assets, and partly because one of her MyHolo genmates is also there now and I feel there's a possibility that that might prove to be an issue, either from her end or from Cover's. Cover hasn't necessarily avoided overt 'nepotism hires' as such (IIRC all three of Gamers were just friends of Fubuki who got in purely by invitation) but management seems to actively try to avoid reuniting past lives as such – most notably, Omaru Polka has never collabed with Tamaki (context with 'forbidden knowledge': >!Polka's talent is a good friend of Norio Tsukudani's and some of her last streams as Oda Nobuhime at upd8 were with Tamaki.!<) And I don't know how tenable it would be to end up with two former genmates from the same agency in separate gens and either having to interact with a different dynamic or even not at all.

I'd like to concur with the other comments so far in that I'm not sure the magic was ever in collabs outside the agency, and I'd also concur with /u/Seijass that there are also some corporate reputations on the line. There are comments on the linked clip about Cover wanting to protect its own brand, which is true enough, but there's also another elephant in the room: no VTuber company has done quite as much as Cover to burn its bridges in China. Now, that doesn't apply as strongly for indies that might want to collab, or for Western agencies like VShojo, but for most JP agencies, collabs with HoloPro become a bit of a double-edged sword, especially for those with a significant hand in the Chinese market. This is especially true for Nijisanji: whereas HoloCN was always a small side project for Cover, a quarter of Anycolor's talents are part of its Chinese arm, VirtuaReal. That's at least 50 people (not counting staff) whose livelihoods and public images rest on Anycolor not becoming *persona non grata* on the Chinese internet the way Cover did back in 2020. A collab here and there is normal and understandable; but regular collabs may be taken by enough angry nationalists as enough of an intimation of collusion that it could cause a cascading PR nightmare.

It's definitely not some kind of hard barrier, but I'd argue it's a bit of a soft cap: it's important to note that the 2020 'Taiwan Incident' was not even the first time there'd been mention of contentious issues relating to Chinese imperialism/nationalism, as there had been a number of mentions of Taiwan, Tibet, and HK in the past that the fanbase had excused. Instead it ended up being a sort of last straw moment for some in relation to what had appeared to be Cover's blasé attitude towards the 'feelings of the Chinese people', and the angrier parts of the CN fanbase started riling up the more moderate ones, not-too-coincidentally against Coco, HoloJP's most overtly Western talent.

So it's not that Nijisanji *can't* collab with Holo because of its Chinese branch, because even the Chinese fanbase has to concede that you cannot ignore the other biggest agency outright. But I'd argue that there's potentially a soft limit to how far and how consistently this collaboration can go.

Just as a quick note, I mean to be explanatory rather than accusatory:

Given IRyS' past life as an utaite, her main schtick has always been singing other people's songs rather than writing her own, and she was almost certainly hired off the basis of her voice and not her songwriting. That's not to say she *isn't* a good songwriter but we legitimately don't know, as you note. Because yeah I agree, her singing is fantastic, and to be honest I think the compositions are at least decent, but the lyrics fall a bit flat. I don't know if anyone else gets this, but there tends to be a frequent tendency to have some awkward phrasing and especially em*pha*sis on the wrong syl*lab*le, to steal a phrase from Dan Olson.

While we don't know if anyone has been scouted for sure since Pekora and Rushia, I don't think it would shick anyone if we were to find out that Cover actively shops around talents who had left other notable agencies, and/or has a certain preference for them. Every JP generation since Gen 4, except for Stars Gen 3, has had at least one member who was used to be with another notable agency: Gen 4 has an ex-Niji, Gen 5 has an ex-upd8, Gen 6 has an ex-Re:Act, and Stars UPROAR has an ex-Unlimited. It's not necessarily coincidence that they'd apply, given that they do have that experience behind them, but nor do I think it's pure coincidence that they passed.

So I have no idea how far this is of interest to anybody, but the discussion around Tsunderia's graduations and its effect on the agency's ranking relative to other EN agencies got me interested enough to do some data entry yesterday to find out. I won't share the full dataset here, but I did a bit of functioning and number crunching to produce [some graphs](https://imgur.com/a/sVVWrle).

To put it mildly, Tsunderia has dropped considerably within the league. To put it more extremely, Tsunderia has dropped *out* of the league. It had been a close contender with PRISM for the #2 spot in terms of total subscribers, while sitting comfortably in #3 for mean subs per member. It's now #5 in both categories, with *half* the total and average subs of Cyberlive at #4.

*That said*, a huge part of that is because of just how popular Miori Celesta is. At the time of her graduating, Miori accounted for a whopping *65%* of the agency's subscribers. Even if nobody else left, that would mean a huge hit in both total and average subs. But these are also, for that same reason, quite superficial numbers: how much traffic was Miori necessarily driving to the rest of Tsunderia, given how far ahead of the others she seems to have gone?

Which in turn raises an interesting question about the other 'top-heavy' agencies: Production Kawaii looks like it has a big lead over Phase-Connect, but it would end up sandwiched between Phase-Connect and Cyberlive without Nene Amano. Cyberlive without Emma would only just edge ahead of Tsunderia post-graduations. PRISM and Phase-Connect, by contrast, seem to have a more even spread, and both would stay where they are rankings-wise without their top member.

What's interesting is that this doesn't contrast *that* heavily with the 'big 3' EN agencies (Holo/Niji/Vshojo), where some agencies have some quite extreme breakout stars, and some don't to the same extent. HoloEN is the top-heaviest, with Gura accounting for around 30% of its total YT subscribers; VShojo is quite close with Ironmouse having a little over 25% of its Twitch followers; NijiEN is the most evenly spread with Vox accounting for only 10% of the total subscribers. On the whole, the top-heaviness trends somewhat lower than at the smaller agencies, but not by an absurd margin, and Holo and Niji would definitely fall in the middle of the pack if mixed in with the others.

Anyway, that was me rambling about stats for a while.

> Also i think like most of holoEN is not an active vtuber before. There's a couple who try vtubing probably a couple times but Bae is an exeption.

That's not entirely correct. I did a quick check and of 11 members of HoloEN, 8 had some kind of prior VTubing experience, to varying degrees of recognition.

----- __355.2__ -----2022-04-21 08:00:55+08:00:

I mean sure, let's discount >!Senzawa!< then for only very intermittently using a VTuber model, and by that same criterion Ina/>!Nagu, who seems to only have only one known stream with a VTuber model, wouldn't count either.!< But even then, 6 out of 11 members had active VTuber presences before debuting with Hololive:

* Ame/>!sachiowo was definitely an active VTuber on Twitch.!<

* IRyS/>!namirin debuted a VTuber model in February 2021 and streamed relatively frequently with it, although she's wiped most of them besides her debut and hiatus announcement streams. Granted, VSinger auditions had closed by this point, so technically she wasn't a VTuber at the time she auditioned, but we also don't know when she was formally hired.!<

* Fauna/>!LemonLeaf was an active VTuber on Twitch, beginning in May 2020 with a redebut in February 2021.!<

* Mumei/>!Shachimu debuted her VTuber model in February 2021 and there are plenty of clips of that.!<

* Kronii/>!Seru Kisen was actively part of a small agency, Virtuality Project, having debuted in March 2021.!<

* Bae we're both on the same page on already.

I'll grant that a lot of them had only recently started VTubing at the time of auditioning – or indeed started during the wait period between auditions and confirmation – but still, over 50% had been active as VTubers for some months before debuting under HoloEN.

Without a doubt, Calli. I do have a good chunk of favourites whom I'll put on consistently, but Calli is about the only one I would say I watch religiously. I think the main thing is there's just such an earnestness to how she presents herself on stream and in her music, even amid all the general VTuber kayfabe. I'm sure I'm not alone in having been introduced to Hololive via her first appearance on Trash Taste, but I also stayed because of her streams rather than those of other Holomems. That's not to say I don't or haven't ever liked any of the others – I actually started out watching Kiara more than I did Calli, and got into HoloJP via Nene (albeit ultimately to settle on Noel as my JP oshi). But it is to say I just enjoy Calli's content the most consistently of all. The fact she streams at a good time for me also helps a lot.

----- __363.1__ -----2022-04-21 23:24:40+08:00:

The Qing queue edict was not simply a means of designating those who might be politically untrustworthy; violation of it was a capital crime. If you grew your forehead hair out except for a handful of special dispensations such as being in mourning, then you were publicly declaring yourself an enemy of the state and would be executed with little fanfare. The reason outlaws had no problem growing out their hair was, well, in the name – these were people living outside the law, aware of the consequences of being caught. I discuss the queue edict at greater length in these two past posts:

* [TUESDAY TRIVIA: "A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life" (Coco Chanel)- why don't you change our lives a bit with some fascinating discussion of the HISTORY OF HAIR!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hieo21/tuesday_trivia_a_woman_who_cuts_her_hair_is_about/fwh86bf/)

* [Since men were, at one point, required to wear the queue hairstyle in China, at the threat of execution, were aging and balding men executed or otherwise punished for failing to comply?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mi00dd/since_men_were_at_one_point_required_to_wear_the/gt2bimi/)

As I allude in those posts, the 1860s would, frankly, have been an *especially* bad time to suddenly develop a predilection for Han hairstyles given that several rebellions – many still in progress – had broken out whose participants signified their allegiance by their defiance of the queue edict. Chief among these were the Taiping, whose association with this was so strong they were known to their enemies as *changmao* 長毛 – literally, the 'Long Hairs'. Having the wrong hairstyle in the wrong place would literally get you killed; when travelling from one area of control to the other it was often necessary to shave to enter Qing territory – and often to have to spend time tanning to mask the obvious tanline from having shaved too recently – or to spend time growing one's hair out to enter Taiping lands. Making the wrong choice about one's hair at the wrong time was fatal. Moreover, for the purposes of our hypothetical 1860s nativist, the Qing sometimes offered cash bounties for severed rebel heads, with the size of the bounty scaling with the length of the forehead hair (5 inches being the maximum). If you, a Han man in a Qing-held city in 1860s China, chose to grow your hair out, *you were going to die.*

### 364: [What happened to anti-Christian sentiment in China that the Christian Sun Yat-sen was able to become President of China just 10 years after the Boxer Rebellion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u8rtzf/what_happened_to_antichristian_sentiment_in_china/), submitted on 2022-04-22 00:41:29+08:00.

----- __364.1__ -----2022-04-22 14:41:11+08:00:

The short answer to this is that China is *big*, but that's perhaps not the level of nuance one would hope for an AskHistorians answer in this day and age. In order to really grasp what was going on, we need to understand the Boxers – themselves somewhat divided between the Shandong and Zhili Boxers – and the Republican movement as distinct entities with distinct areas of appeal, both geographically and demographically, as well as quite distinct motives.

The Shandong Boxers were certainly anti-Christian, but arguably not anti-Christianity, at least not in any theological sense. The Boxer movement in Shandong had been largely the product of long-tern tensions within Shandong specifically, and related largely to the more pragmatic dimensions of how missions interacted with local society. In order to limit tensions with foreign powers, Qing authorities in the region had historically been relatively lenient towards missionaries for fear of provoking an international incident, and their converts, by implication, ostensibly ended up covered under a similar umbrella. There came to be a persistent rumour among non-converts that petty criminals and small-time bandits were converting to Christianity to essentially gain diplomatically-backed immunity from prosecution, which helped stoke animosity and fuelled the rise of anti-Christian movements like the Big Sword Society. However, this growth was also partly the product of economic stress in Shandong in conjunction with relatively weak local government, which made conditions ripe for the establishment and expansion of mutual aid groups, which on the one hand included the 'secret societies', but on the other also included the Christian missions, thereby further pushing the cycle along.

The Zhili Boxers were a much more abruptly formed movement, with 'Boxerism' so to speak having been imported from Shandong in late 1899 as Yuan Shikai, recently appointed as governor of Shandong, started actively hunting down Boxer cells and driving practitioners northwards. Whereas the Shandong Boxers were somewhat of an organic product of long-term local conditions, the Boxers in Zhili gained their support from much more immediate, but still largely local concerns. Chief among these was a period of drought in the region that the Zhili Boxers blamed on spiritual pollution in the form of the presence of foreign missionaries and their Chinese converts. This was a much more spiritually-motivated objection than had been the case in Shandong, but one that was no more theological: it didn't have anything to do with any specific precepts of Christianity, but rather the perceived implications of their physical presence.

Looking at the Boxer movement as a whole, this was a phenomenon whose purchase was primarily among rural communities in northern China, and related primarily to the local implications of foreign missionary activity, rather than a regional manifestation of a China-wide state of general anti-Christian sentimetn. Moreover, it is important to understand that the Boxers were a pro-Qing force [(though what exactly 'pro-Qing' meant in 1900 was a little uncertain owing to a recent coup and ongoing succession crisis)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q9pvuv/why_did_the_qing_government_support_the_boxers/hgysbu9/). Supporters of the Boxers in 1900 would be highly unlikely to support the revolution in 1911, irrespective of their location. Indeed, supporters of the Boxers in 1900 were not particularly numerous, either: several Qing provinces refused to support the court in its war against the foreign powers, with reformist elements of the government such as Li Honghang, Zhang Zhidong, and Yuan Shikai all overtly opposing the Boxer movement.

The republican movement could not have been any more different from the Boxers if it had tried. For one, it was vehemently anti-Qing: as the 'republican' label suggests, it had no interest whatever in compromising with the Qing, unlike the comparably radical Constitutionalist movement. For another, its demographic makeup was essentially the opposite of the Boxers': whereas the Boxers appealed mainly to the rural poor of northern China, the republicans, and their Constitutionalist rivals, were overwhelmingly from southern China, especially Guangdong, and they were broadly urban and skewed wealthy. On the republican side, Sun Yat-Sen was from a modest rural background, but spent many of his formative years in Honolulu supported by a relatively well-off brother and subsequently moved to Hong Kong, where he founded his Revive China Society; on the Constitutionalist side, the movement's founder Kang Youwei was from the mid-sized Cantonese city of Foshan (or Fatshan), and later moved mainly between Guangzhou (Canton), Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing, followed by protegés such as Liang Qichao. After the Qing cracked down on these movements, their leaders operated mainly as emigrés, schmoozing for support in Japan, the United States, and the European empires. In short, these were people who were well-educated, well-connected, relatively well-off, and, ultimately, well-travelled.

They were also, it must be noted, not really the people who started the revolution. Sun Yat-Sen's Tongmenghui, or Revolutionary Alliance, had some cells in east-central China at the time of the Wuchang Uprising, but it had historically focussed its efforts on Guangdong and was utterly unprepared for the sudden spate of popular uprisings and military mutinies that swept the Yangtze beginning in October 1911. The mutiny in Wuchang had coalesced around secret revolutionary cells, yes, but these were cells that had emerged organically within the New Army with no serious connection to the emigré agitators. Sun Yat-Sen had been fundraising in Colorado when the mutinies began, and would not arrive in China until 21 December. By this stage the Wuchang revolutionaries, led by Li Yuanhong, had already made a ceasefire with the imperial loyalists some two weeks earlier, and were in the middle of negotiations with Yuan Shikai to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to both the revolutionary and reformist camps. Sun's election as President of the Republic of China in Nanjing on 29 December was a largely symbolic gesture that has been interpreted a few ways, but he almost certainly did not expect to retain the post – he simply lacked significant credibility in the Yangtze valley outside a segment of the urban middle class concentrated in Shanghai, and moreover he lacked an army. One of his allies, Huang Xing, had managed to insert himself into a position of high military command in Wuchang off the back of support from the pro-Tongmenghui leadership of the revolutionaries in Shanghai, but was unable to entirely sideline Li Yuanhong, who officially remained 'vice-generalissimo' and would end up assuming the post of Vice-President when Sun was elected President.

Now, that said, I have rather quietly elided over the fact that Li Yuanhong himself was also Christian, but that is because in the context of 1911 Wuchang, that really wasn't a big deal. The Yangtze valley region, historically lumped under south China, was simply not economically or demographically equivalent to Shandong and Zhili; there had been no Boxer presence there, nor indeed any other form of widespread, organised anti-Christian movement, in the years prior. The anti-Christianity of the Boxers had, in any case, been a temporary response to specifically local issues, and was not reflective of longer-term trends in China as a whole as regards the Han Chinese population's relationship to Christianity.

### 371: [Compared to Thucydides on one hand and Herodotus on the other, how trustworthy is Xenophon?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u9xf4f/compared_to_thucydides_on_one_hand_and_herodotus/), submitted on 2022-04-23 12:36:00+08:00.

With the disclaimer that this lies outside my primary wheelhouse, it is important to stress that classical sources of any kind should not be read at face value: everyone has some kind of agenda that influences their work to some extent. This is *especially* true of both Thucydides and Tacitus, who make little secret of their particular leanings. On Thucydides, /u/Iphikrates has pointed out several issues with his narrative before, including:

* [This answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dyz200/what_was_pericles_endgame/f8622ik/?context=999) which discusses Schubert and Laspe's argument that Thucydides straight up invented the idea of a 'Periclean strategy' in order to exonerate Perikles while smearing Kleon for doing exactly the same things Perikles did;

* [This answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/93962e/every_once_in_a_while_i_come_across_the_term/e3cwklz/) which discusses how Thucydides elided the 'First Peloponnesian War' to suit his narrative, while also shoehorning the Archidamian War, the Sicilian expedition, and the Dekeleian War into a single narrative.

On Tacitus, /u/PippinIRL discusses aspects of Tacitus' agenda [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gdz8mm/when_reading_tacitus_the_barbarians_and_enemies/).

Xenophon had an agenda as well of course, but generally a less overt one. I can't locate a specific defence of Xenophon on the sub and I'm hardly the most qualified person to write one, but I'd like to direct your attention to [this post](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9bsg76/recommended_reading_for_late_greece_rise_of/e55fthq/?context=999) by /u/Iphikrates noting some of the other sources for fourth-century Greek history. Xenophon's narrative in the *Hellenika* is, in both our views, far less problematic than many historians in the twentieth century made it out to be, but it nevertheless is quite a concentrated one that omits a number of areas that do not contribute to the core narrative, perhaps most infamously the Second Athenian Confederacy which is known almost exclusively via epigraphic evidence.

Goodness me, I remember playing NationStates literal *years* ago.

I'll admit, this is more along the lines of corporate intrigue than hobby drama at this stage, but given the general tolerance for VTuber discussion I hope I'll be indulged. You see, in the past few months, there have been a few... interesting shakeups at ANYCOLOR Inc., the company behind VTuber agency Nijisanji (the sort-of predecessor to Cover Corp's Hololive and arguably its primary competitor). And the most recent announcement has put a lot of that in perspective.

Probably the biggest shakeup has to do with its international branches. At the start of the year, Nijisanji had four international branches: VirtuaReal (its Chinese branch, operated in conjunction with Chinese streaming platform Bilibili), Nijisanji Indonesia (NijiID for short), Nijisanji Korea (NijiKR), and Nijisanji English (NijiEN). In mid-February, it was announced that from 1 April, NijiID and NijiKR would be merged into Nijisanji proper, while VirtuaReal and NijiEN would continue as self-contained entities; while any members who wished to stay would, they would no longer be specifically branded as part of the ID or KR branches; all auditions for both of the merged branches were also being suspended. This was a decision that confused quite a lot of people. Now, the effective dissolution of NijiKR as a unit was not a wholly unexpected development: it wasn't hugely successful, and it had long been known to have management issues, stemming in part from its originally being the result of ANYCOLOR buying up a few small Korean agencies, including one with a rather infamous bully – and since then at least two more NijiKR members have been at the centre of bullying accusations. But the absorption of NijiID, which has historically been comparatively popular and has never been known to have serious internal issues, was a definite surprise. There was nothing to suggest it was particularly insolvent or that its management was particularly problematic. In turn, the question of why NijiEN wasn't being merged also came up if the other international branches were being subsumed. (VirtuaReal not being merged was less of a shock as it was, as almost all overseas ventures in China are, run jointly with a Chinese corporation.) The merger's exact reasons were never communicated, and its effects were... mixed. On the one hand, NijiID very much kept trucking and has been doing a lot of crossover collaborations, but on the other, NijiKR has been losing several more members: at the time of the merger announcement it had 20 members; 7 will have retired by the end of this week.

As a sort of aside, quite recently ANYCOLOR released an interview with one of its overseas content managers as a pitch for potential applicants, with a number of interesting details, but for me, the two big ones verged on the merger situation. The first was this quote from early on:

> The Overseas Talent Managers of ANYCOLOR provide full support to NIJISANJI's overseas branches, including those in Indonesia and China. 

While obviously one does not want to note too much by omission, the sort of reaffirmation of the Indonesian branch while quietly ignoring the Korean branch is noticeable. The second is this one nearer the end:

> Especially for the position we are now recruiting for, English proficiency is a must as we would like you to be in charge of English-speaking Livers. 

Again, it's not clear how much to draw from this, but I don't think it's too much to suggest that Anycolor isn't looking to continue expansion much beyond what it considers its existing principal international markets, i.e. the Anglosphere (with ID probably mixed in) and possibly China (though it's probable that the management on that side is heavily outsourced via the Bilibili partnership). Considering that the Spanish-speaking VTuber market has been quite noticeable, there have been some smaller Japanese agencies (notably the now rather infamous WACTOR) trying to get in on it and there is some fan pressure on Hololive to do the same, and so Nijisanji seems to be rather explicitly stating that it's not aiming at that market for the near future.

The less big splash was the [closure of Yumenographia at the end of 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/qvy7en/yumenographia_to_end_service_on_december_30/). Yumenographia was a non-Nijisanji ANYCOLOR project which was pitched as a VR hostess club (host/hostess clubs being a form of nightclub where the wait staff are expected to converse with and entertain the patrons). Yumenographia had been around since late 2019 (I believe) and there was a run of collabs between Yumenographia and both Nijisanji and Hololive (specifically Gen 2's Subaru) in early 2020. It seems to have been reasonably well-liked, but according to the announcement of its closure it was not *as* profitable as hoped (while not explicitly stated to be in the red either):

> 様々な取り組みを行ってまいりましたが、想定していた成長曲線を描くことが難しく、今後の展開を考慮した結果、誠に残念ではございますが、サービスの終了という決断に至りました。 今まで多くのご支持をいただいてきたことに、運営チーム一同、大変感謝しております。

My Japanese is unbrilliant, but DeepL's translation gives:

> Despite our various efforts, it has been difficult to achieve the growth curve we had envisioned, and after considering future developments, we have regrettably come to the decision to terminate the service. The entire management team is very grateful for the support we have received so far.

I thought the phrase 'growth *curve*' was interesting, because I looked at this announcement after a very recent *other* announcement by ANYCOLOR which puts it all in perspective: ANYCOLOR is going public.

So, now it's starting to make more sense: if KR, ID, and Yumenographia were not growing, or not growing quickly enough, then it made sense to axe them before the IPO. Yumenographia being a separate project, it was erased outright (its joint Youtube channel has had its content wiped and the individual members' YT accounts deleted entirely), while KR and ID's members were retained by merging them into the main Niji branch and essentially subsuming the apparent loss into the overall profit of the core agency. Going back to the 'growth curve', my take is that ANYCOLOR is predicting slower growth in 2022-3 than it had in 2021-2, and so it's going public while it can still report a very high annual growth relative to 2020-1, rather than doing it at a point where it has to admit a slowing of growth between 2021-2 and 2022-3.

The implications this has for Niji as an agency are still unclear. As it stands, the CEO still holds a plurality stake of something like 46% while something like 8% are held by company employees, so the majority of ANYCOLOR is still internally owned. But I'm inclined to agree with some of the pessimistic takes that ANYCOLOR is pivoting harder towards profit from here on out. In particular, there's some indication that it's heavily pushing EN as its big thing, especially Luxiem (its first all-male generation) at the expense of the rest of the agency. [This particular subthread](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/ubo799/goddamned_gobshite_godfrey_weekly_discussion/i6i0g3l/) on the VirtualYoutubers subreddit mentions one such case with ANYCOLOR announcing things about EN merch as a seemingly arbitrary addendum to a statement about certain changes to one of their top Japanese members' planned merch. More recently it's been announced that Luxiem will be appearing at Anime Fest in Dallas in July, which I believe is the third NijiEN appearance at an English-language convention, with the previous two both being attended by the first Nijisanji English generation, LazuLight. Why Ethyria and Obsydia, which also predate Luxiem, haven't done cons yet is anyone's guess I suppose, unless of course you're of the cynical sort and see it as Niji pushing Luxiem especially.

Now, I do hope that on some level I'm wrong and that things can keep going as is. But from what I can tell, going public is the sort of thing that won't necessarily make things at the agency better, and comes with a high risk of them becoming worse. To lay my cards out on the table I am not an avid Niji watcher; LazuLight didn't vibe with me much so I didn't really give it a second thought until recently. And I am to some extent a diehard Hololive tribalist who wants to see Hololive do better than Nijisanji. But I want that to be on Hololive's own merits and I don't want Nijisanji to do worse, because there are many talented people there who don't deserve to have their careers cut short by their agency making a risky financial decision. So, here's hoping for the best.
