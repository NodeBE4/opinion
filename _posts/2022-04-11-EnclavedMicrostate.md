### 332: [Without barriers the British still know how to queue!](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/u0yw8a/without_barriers_the_british_still_know_how_to/), submitted on 2022-04-11 11:59:49+08:00.

Yep, a radio series, a book series based on the radio series, a semi-rebooted radio series based on the book series, and a TV series based on the original radio series. The original radio and book continuities diverge, but the second radio series is a direct adaptation of the latter part of the book series. The TV series (which goes up to roughly the end of book 2) hews closer to the radio series but not exactly.

### 333: [1973: Native American actor Sacheen Littlefeather boo'd (and cheered) by Hollywood at the Oscars before being mocked by Clint Eastwood and almost physically assaulted by John Wayne simply for asking that Indigenous people not to be dehumanized in film](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/u10voq/1973_native_american_actor_sacheen_littlefeather/), submitted on 2022-04-11 14:05:30+08:00.

> the only Eastwood western with native Americans mentioned at all is Joe Kidd

Also *The Outlaw Josey Wales*, *Hang 'Em High*, and *Ambush at Cimmaron Pass*.
