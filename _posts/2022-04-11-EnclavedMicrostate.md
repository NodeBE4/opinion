Yep, a radio series, a book series based on the radio series, a semi-rebooted radio series based on the book series, and a TV series based on the original radio series. The original radio and book continuities diverge, but the second radio series is a direct adaptation of the latter part of the book series. The TV series (which goes up to roughly the end of book 2) hews closer to the radio series but not exactly.
