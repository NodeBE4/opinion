### 333: [Without barriers the British still know how to queue!](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/u0yw8a/without_barriers_the_british_still_know_how_to/), submitted on 2022-04-11 11:59:49+08:00.

Yep, a radio series, a book series based on the radio series, a semi-rebooted radio series based on the book series, and a TV series based on the original radio series. The original radio and book continuities diverge, but the second radio series is a direct adaptation of the latter part of the book series. The TV series (which goes up to roughly the end of book 2) hews closer to the radio series but not exactly.

Calli also apparently learned Latin at school, so that also doesn't save us.

To add my two cents, it's worth distinguishing between why it was *originally* introduced, and why it might still be done now. To be frank, it was originally done because Activ8 believed it ought to have such total control over Kizuna AI's image that even her VA's actual identity was to be concealed from the public. Many VTubers *today* appreciate the anonymity, and it might be *their* reason for doing it, but its original existence in corporate contracts, particularly of a lot of early agencies, is probably a function of most of these companies basically emulating Activ8's model without necessarily thinking that hard about the full implications down the line.

### 337: [Bosnia is almost landlocked, but it has a narrow, 12-mile long piece of land on the Adriatic Sea.

### 338: [Mio gave Fubuki a ring! This is not a drill, Mio gave Fubuki a ring!! This truly is フブミオてぇてぇ of the purest quality~ (TL by Major Arcana #310 Big God Mion)](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/u1kivz/mio_gave_fubuki_a_ring_this_is_not_a_drill_mio/), submitted on 2022-04-12 07:15:18+08:00.

----- __338.1__ -----2022-04-12 12:16:05+08:00:

Um... yeah? Kinda?

Well, there's two aspects to this. The first is that simply put, calling them lovers is applying modern and honestly somewhat heteronormative standards to ancient Macedonian society. Alexander almost certainly did not see his relationship with Hephaistion as equivalent to that with, say, Roxane; that is to say it wasn't just 'the same thing, but with a man'.

The other is that the sources that play up the possible romantic and/or sexual relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion are... dubious. It's very clear that Alexander was in some way very affectionate towards Hephaistion and we do get this from the majority of the source material, but the sources suggesting this went beyond a deeply affectionate friendship are those that try to map Alexander and Hephaistion onto Achilles and Patroklos. These sources are problematic on this count because they try to paint Alexander as a quintessentially Greek hero, almost a walking embodiment of Greek high culture, instead of as a Macedonian warlord. In effect, the 'Achilles+Hephaistion = Achilles+Patroklos' narrative is one rooted more in Greek chauvinism than historical fact.


Oh also with Mio she did say the garnet was for 'friendship' specifically, so I feel like that's explicit enough of an indication. We’re not at Noel/Flare levels of platinum bridal rings just yet.

EDIT: I guess the main thing to say is, its not that we're incorrectly defining Alexander and Hephaistion as friends, it's that the way we colloquially use 'friend' today encompasses different ideas from how people of the time understood it.
