[Putin may decide that the benefits of reasserting Russia’s global power through an invasion of Ukraine outweigh any domestic political costs. But if he chooses this course, he risks alienating Russians, argues Andrei Kolesnikov.](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2022-02-09/would-russians-embrace-war)

### 111: [When Redlines Fail: The Promise and Peril of Public Threats](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/siscdv/when_redlines_fail_the_promise_and_peril_of/), submitted on 2022-02-03 00:07:31+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Dan Altman, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Georgia State University, and Kathleen E. Powers, Assistant Professor of Government at Dartmouth College\]

"In the end, setting redlines is neither wisdom nor folly. Given the lack of appealing alternatives, Washington will inevitably need to use this tactic to bargain with and deter adversaries. But it need not do so under false assumptions. The reputational risk of walking back from a redline is not as great as many fear. Nor are the strongest redlines—or those that are trumpeted with brash language and swagger—the most effective. Such threats risk provoking more than they coerce and establishing credibility at the price of assurance. To be effective, redlines should be carefully calibrated to convey U.S. demands, provide necessary assurances, and avoid provoking their targets. Whether the United States is dealing with China, Iran, or Russia, striking the right balance will be the key to success."

----- __113.1__ -----2022-02-04 22:51:38+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Adam E. Casey, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weiser Center for Emerging Democracies at the University of Michigan, and Seva Gunitsky Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto.\]

"It is still unclear if Putin will slip up. Although Russia continues to mass forces on Ukraine’s borders, no one knows if the president will ultimately attack the country or, if he does, just how far he will go. Intelligence reports suggest Putin has not yet made up his mind, and his public statements contain mixed messages. But if he makes a miscalculation and launches a major invasion, it will likely be because of the personalist features of his regime. It will then fall on Kyiv and its partners to check him, because there is no one in Russia who will."

### 114: [America’s Failure of Imagination in Sudan: Washington Should Have More Faith in the Forces of Democracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/skf5bx/americas_failure_of_imagination_in_sudan/), submitted on 2022-02-04 22:53:55+08:00.

----- __114.1__ -----2022-02-04 22:55:06+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Michelle Gavin Senior Fellow for Africa Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and former U.S. Ambassador to Botswana\]

“The United States need not assume that Sudan is destined for authoritarianism. Even in the face of consistent and often lethal repression, Sudan’s brave and resilient pro-democracy activists remain a powerful force for change.”
