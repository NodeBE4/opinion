RT Angela Zhang<br>China was one of the first countries to regulate the algorithms driving some of the most addictive social-media platforms.

An official commentary published yesterday in the CCP's official People’s Daily newspaper is one of the more egregious efforts to date to present China's handling of the pandemic over the past three years as evidence of strong global leadership. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/01/09/whitewashing-chinas-record-on-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/01/09/whitewashing-chinas-record-on-covid/</a>

RT Emily Feng 冯哲芸<br>Re One anecdote that has left me shaken: this woman on this @derspiegel cover was also arrested. She found herself at the vigil by accident: "I drink every weekend, but the police didn't believe that I was just drinking there. They think I am the organizer." https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/index-2022-49.html
