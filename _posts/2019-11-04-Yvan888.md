It exactly fits my observations, there are some obviously incorrect comments on the current HK-related contents such as *HK cops are all Chinese military* 

I have to scroll down a lot to find some insightful comments with just several upvotes. It’s hard to happen when in an environment where typing *fuck china* could earn 5k karmas

IMO the average quality of Reddit’s contents are still much better than the majority Chinese websites, but not surpass all of them (I exclude the Chinese censorship factor here) and lesser than I expected 

Maybe this is a dumb question. But how large can Reddit reflect the average American attitude? I know this is not a serious and unique website, but there are still lots of differences among websites regrading to the age, region, class, ethnicity, political wings, etc.

拉丁文 

「I came, I saw, I conquered」翻譯自拉丁語的「veni, vidi, vici」，但這句拉丁原文其實是没有第一人稱「我」的。英語翻譯中有「I」，因為「veni, vidi, vici」這裏的都是第一人稱完成式（first-person perfect tense）。

因此，「veni, vidi, vici」在中文裏可以翻譯作「至之，見之，征之」或「來之，見之，勝之」

>	The USSR, even at its most repressive, didn't restrict the creative juices of its comrade citizens in anything like the way that the CCP does in China (and continues to do)

How it comes beside arms race? And, actually, the trade war and other competitions with the west would also force CCP to reform in some fields if they want to survive (that’s why some Chinese are actually kinda happy to see a trade war because the outside force will bring inside reform, in Chinese it’s called 体制外压力倒逼体制内改革. The west is the only global opposition party that criticizes but also pushes CCP to become better).

I don’t have much knowledge of the Soviet Union education system but afaik they are much strict or rigid. 

I also doubt that Soviet Union is more liberal than today’s China. Somebody always argues that liberal society brings innovations, if this argument is true, it would contradict to your argument.

I do agree that China’s IP regulation sucks but, again, given the fact that there is no free market in Soviet Union, I’m not that sure how the IP system (if there exists a functioning one) promotes the Soviet Union’s innovation. At the same time, the regulation laws and IP mindset in China becomes better in these three or four years at least by my observations. There are less counterfeits on Taobao, the young generations are much more willing to pay for music, game, ebooks, apps, etc. I know it’s still a shithole of IP, especially from the eyes of the first world people, but at the same time I would agree there are not-small improvements in China, not to say that [the lack of regulation and couterfiet shit have less or more happened in the earlier phase of development of developed countries such as German, Japan, and even American](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/drvseg/til_that_in_the_19th_century_america_was/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). (But maybe China is the worst? btw I’m not defending any IP violation here and I detest them)

Even if China’s comprehensive system is much weaker than USSR. Given the unpredicted amount of population of China, 1.4b people compared with USSR’s 147-162m people at that time, it means that USSR’s system must be 10x more efficient than China’s to produce the same amount of innovations. It’s a rough computation here but kinda makes sense.

There are also at least three points you miss here:

1.	As /u/oolongvanilla mentioned, China can compensate the missing parts such as innovation caused by authoritarian system from the freedom world by oversea education (and acquisition, added by me). And it’s HUGE.
2.	IMO Soviet Union’s outset is much better than China because it had absorbed much knowledge and experience from the west at that time and finished industrialization early. China nowadays is still catching up in this field.
3.	There are some private schools and functioning entities outside the traditional Chinese system nowadays in these several years, for the demand from the burgeoning bourgeois. And they will become more and more popular in the future. While Chinese government seems to become more authoritarian again, don’t overlook the empowerment in some aspects.

2.	少部分还是希望中国自由化的人，绝望也的确有。但我个人不会太绝望，毕竟过个千年中国还在那。只不过感到可惜。一是可惜中国没能及时走上更好的道路长远来看或许会错失很多文明成长的机会，二是可惜我有生之年可能看不到一个不仅物质富裕更是精神强大的中华文明。不过同时我也挺享受现在的生活，不管是在中国还是在西方，不管世界是走向和平还是对抗（其中跟中国或者说中共怎么选有莫大关系）。每代人都有其应做之义务，也有其所局限之处，我们也不例外。

----- __175.1__ -----2019-11-09 23:06:43+08:00:

1.	Minimalism means to give up the things you don’t need, nothing more nothing less, but NOT force yourself to give up something you don’t want to give up.
2.	I use ebooks for a long time, most of them are ePubs in iBooks, some of them are mobis in kindle or ebooks in another Chinese reading app. I figure out it’s enjoying and convenient because 1) I’m also kinda minialist and don’t mind up giving up physical books 2) I can read the books whenever and wherever I want with different devices (iPhone, iPad, kindle, mac) thanks to the sync of reading position and notes 3) It’s actually easier to make notes by finger and manage notes by app itself and third part apps such as Klib on Mac.

所以，我看清楚了，中共心里就是对人民不信任。不管是当年虽然上街但还是举着五星红旗的学生，还是今天越加不那么反感六四的中国人们，中共都还是不信任。换做别国有这么听话的人民，做梦都笑出声了。

这就是为什么，虽然PRC历史上有诸多次中央下放权力的经历，但随后都会走会收紧的老路。就是因为中共无论具备多大的权力和统治力，心里都还是不安心，对内不信任，对外不信任，对宗教不信任，对文化不信任，对民企不信任，对地方不信任。这是一种病，无解。

所以现在西方很多国家也慢慢看清楚了，当年指望通过WTO和贸易来接触并改善CCP下的PRC是异想天开的。集权体制只有非常少的概率会自己放权（当然，不是没有，比如台湾）

>	不太理解为啥西方人这么讨厌中国政府

1.	激进自由派，认为自己应当拯救世界。不管是一党专政下的中国人、印度压迫的克什米尔、土耳其正在打的库尔德人、甚至以色列对巴勒斯坦的镇压，都是他们解救的对象。在这些选择中，人权纪录极端糟糕且掌握资源异常强大的中共，自然是他们的首要目标。西方本来就对一切阻碍言论自由宗教自由的存在深恶痛绝
2.	 温和自由派，也对中共威胁到自由世界本身感到忧虑。这次香港事件发生后，NBA、暴雪、苹果等跨国公司的涉华举止，西方各国和学校的中国居民和学生的种种言行作为，都在自由世界的全民范围内引发了对中国/中共的对自由世界本身价值观的腐蚀的担忧。类似于“中共一天不倒，世界不会好，总会威胁到我们自己”。
3.	保守派，更多是国家利益的争夺。

----- __176.5__ -----2019-11-09 17:01:38+08:00:

首先，这不等于说政治里面没有腐败等因素的。其次，沙特太弱，其实是个人包括美国人都知道沙特是一直背后输出恐怖主义，但这种就是小打小闹，大国们就是看个笑话，这跟对苏联那种日后全自由世界都被集权政府所控制的恐惧是截然不同的。最后，我只是解释一部分西方精英对中共的看法，但不等于西方特别是美国手脚很干净，他们干过的坏事也不少，甚至是推翻民主政府。

补充：信不信由你，我个人认为这跟西方一直尝试拉中国（和印度）做盟友也有关系，过去一百年里，美国等国的同情中国且建议拥抱大熊猫的声音可不少。

>	墙越建越高我不清楚

中国的言论自由和其他自由，从六四后就一直收紧，但江胡时期还算差强人意。但习改宪后开始直线式下滑。这不是我个人的看法，是我身边不管是学术界、工商届还是体质内人士的大部人的共识。若你前几年说感觉不到，那尚可理解，但这几年也感觉不到？

观点如何可以讨论，比如你可以说收紧是为了贸易战什么的，但若你感觉不到收紧...那怀疑你是在另一个世界。

### 177: [HE OWES THE CCP: Mike Bloomberg recently said Xi Jinping is “not a dictator” and the Chinese Communist party is “responsive” to its people. That right there should disqualify him from ever being President of the United States.](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dte30q/he_owes_the_ccp_mike_bloomberg_recently_said_xi/), submitted on 2019-11-08 19:23:12+08:00.

----- __177.1__ -----2019-11-09 06:41:55+08:00:

It's predictable. 

I notice that the dovish tones always come from the enterprise groups and related people, such as Mike Bloomberg, John Biden, Times, Bloomberg agency, etc. The hawkish denounces always come from either extreme liberal groups who see China as a threat to the freedom world (ideology) or extreme conservative groups who see China as a threat to​ the west (civilization). 

Although nearly all of them nowadays favor being uncompromising towards China, their motivations behind are much different. The enterprise groups want to push China to sign a more fair deal so that they can earn more profits there which may end up tighter bind with China, while others may want to decouple with China until CCP is toppled. 

It's still far away from having a consensus on China though on the surface it seems that all the people are suddenly standing up to fight CCP.

----- __177.2__ -----2019-11-09 08:11:46+08:00:

The key of success of CCP is that they understand the more you oppress the more you can’t oppress so it satisfies the last three of [Maslow’s hierarchy of five needs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow’s_hierarchy_of_needs?wprov=sfti1) while denying the top two. It also tries to persuaded the people with the last three needs that seeking the top two needs would end up losing anything.

Given the help of technology and nationalism, it’s a sophisticated oppression comprised of both hard and soft approaches.

Understood. It depends on how you define it. It’s more like deliberately misleading but not satisfying.

----- __180.3__ -----2019-11-10 11:43:01+08:00:

这个问题涵盖范围非常广，我尽量简略点回答：

**1. 意识形态层面**

1.1 反共根基：这点你说的不错，香港的本色本来就有很浓厚的反共氛围，因为很多不管上层还是下层的港人都是当年从大陆因为日本或者中共的问题而先后逃难过去的，属于历史惯性。冷战时英美等国基于意识形态的对抗，也在香港拥有了很多自己的势力，作为接触或/和抗拒中共的第一线。（不过同样地，香港也是中共对外的第一线之一，当年和今天，都有很多的物资、人员和资金是由香港从自由世界转到大陆里面的，所以彼此彼此）

1.2 反感中央：其实老生常谈了，香港对中共的观感恶化有几次，文革和六四是最恶劣的两次。另外，香港大部分人一直都认为当年中共答应英国给香港民主但随后的部分选举是假民主，所以有当年的占中活动。其他加强了港人对中央的反感的事件，包括但不限于，汶川地震捐款贪污、铜锣湾书店老板被抓、送中议案（港珠澳大桥这种我就不算进去了）。

1.3 自由民主追求：当年，港英时期，香港虽然没有民主但相对而言是亚洲最文明发达自由的地方，但是到了今天，香港的民主甚至自由进程已经远远比不上后达的国家和地区诸如日本、韩国、台湾、东南亚部分国家等，所以港人不会因为港英政府没有民主就今天不追求民主（另外，还有一个比较阴谋论的是，当年港英几次想给香港民主，但是中央军事威胁说不能给，不过这个我还没考证过）。同时，大部分大陆人低估了已经自由地区诸如港台对大陆政府不自由政策的抗拒程度，人们对自由度的追求，往前走容易，但往回走是千难万难的。今天大陆人觉得大陆生活还好，是因为从小就在这个体制内长大已经习惯了，所以即使没有更大程度的自由也似乎没问题，但若有人拉你会毛时代的话相信绝大多数人也不肯，就像港台地区人们不想回大陆体制一样。尽管大陆应许了一国两制，但归根到底是归中央管的，当中央没有诚信和实力说服别人的时候，别人是不会把自己自由的命拱手相让。（另外，许多大陆人用自己在欧美生活了好多年也不反感大陆生活作为理由，其实是很牵强的，因为绝大多数海外陆人根本没有参与到自由民主的社会机器里面，他们只是在读书、科研、工作、做生意，而不是观察并参与诸如选举、讨论、关爱弱势群体、社会多元进程等议题）

**2. 经济民生层面**

2.1 自由行政策的失败：自由行只是惠及了香港的大老板们（生意和地价），而大部分香港人要忍受上涨的地价甚至物价，很多香港的民生店铺被奢侈品店等取代。同时，自由行的很多陆客的确素养也不高，对港人生活的影响很重。（不过这点我认为港府要背不少锅，当年真正同意如此体量的自由行的是港府）

2.2 其他问题：数码港失败、楼价问题等。。。这些国内有大量讨论我就不说了。不过我不认为这些问题是反共甚至反中的根源，根源是意识形态，可是国内媒体经常把其引导为经济问题和美国干涉。

**3. 身份认同层面**

3.1 跟大陆人主体的脱离：鉴于两地长时间的制度隔离，加上主体语言不一样，大家的三观相差非常大。这点，原本如果再过十年，待大陆文化产品非常强势后，或许本可以缓解，毕竟香港00后貌似看大陆的东西比以前多了。可惜，现在反送中这么一闹，这种可能性变低了不少。

3.2 香港本土一代的诞生：这点很关键，以前香港人更多是大陆逃难过去的，认为自己是中国人很正常，但是新生一代，一辈子都是在香港成长的，对香港的归属感非常强，而对大陆的归属感比较弱，而（3.1）更是加强了这个趋势。就像留美一代会认为自己是华人，而二代则大多认为是美国人，甚至嫌弃华人的身份。

3.3 本土族群意识的觉醒：本土意识大概是2010年后正式觉醒的，像（3.1）（3.2）所述，香港是有本土派的种子的，但是这颗种子本来不会被激发，反而可能被抹去。而真正被激发就是上述（1）（2）大点的一系列问题，以及伴随的对香港未来被彻底同化的深度恐惧，其中有温和的民主统一论等，也有激进的香港城邦论、香港自决论等（类似当年英美一样）。

---

总之，香港基于意识形态的原因，是有非常强的争取自由民主和保卫原有法治公民社会的愿望和决心的。

而潜在港独的产生，是由原来制度和意识形态上的脱离，演变为文化的脱离，再演变为身份认同的脱离。

香港更加倾向于用西方的契约制度，即可以不脱离，但跟中央谈判是一个较为平等的双方缔结契约的过程，权力的过程是从下而上的。

中央更加倾向于中国原有的大一统中央地方的制度，即我可以给你权力，但我也有权力随时收回，香港跟中央是孩子与妈妈的关系，权力的过程是从上而下的。

一者由下至上，一者由上至下，两者的认知和诉求是**有根本性的不可调和的结构性矛盾**。

这次的反送中和五大诉求，不管是合理的还是被激化的，不管是完全自愿的还是部分被操控的，我认为都不重要，因为这些只是直接原因，而根本原因就是上述的结构性矛盾，近乎无解。没有这次反送中，也有下次的矛盾爆发。至于什么中央大陆让利、大湾区建设，反而加深别人的对自己独立性丧失的恐惧，汝之蜜糖，彼之砒霜罢了。

其实，我个人认为，如果中共能提交一个法案，即证明中共的权力是可被监督的可被制衡的，那也不是不可以一党制。可惜，这个貌似现在理论上不可能。西方和整个自由世界惧怕的，不是一党制，而是一党制背后的1984的风险。一党专制的上下限都非常大，可能几代明君经济发展社会昌盛，但若万一有个暴君和独裁者上台，中国乃至整个世界却没有监督和制衡的机制，那是非常危险的事情。多党民主制以及配套的公民社会、法治社会、舆论自由等，保证的不是几十年社会多么美好，而是长远而言不会出现太差的无法弥补的后果。

> 现在也不是中国一个是一党执政吧，新加坡，越南，古巴，朝鲜这都是啊，为啥新加坡越南都没问题，到中国朝鲜就不行了

自由世界恐惧的，是一个异常强大的会威胁到自由世界本身的专制政府，比如当年的苏联，你说的越南古巴朝鲜都太小了。而且，西方对古巴朝鲜也没有什么好脸色，只不过中国或许是主要矛盾，而其他是次要矛盾。另外，新加坡不是专制，它有选举制度，是半自由的民主政体，只不过得益于李光耀的余威，人民行动党几乎每次都获胜而已。再者，即使是新加坡，西方的激进自由派也不喜欢李光耀。

最后，当年美国克林顿拉中国进入WTO并且融于全球体系，是想养大中国的中产阶级，从内部推动中国的自由化和民主化，转变为自由世界的盟友（虽然中国国内一直把这个当作是中国战忽局的忽悠成功）。在今年看到习修宪和一系列操作后，西方的政界对华共识跟民众对华态度，已经发生了诸多负面的转变，未来中西的对抗会更加激烈，只能说希望不要变成冷战吧。

Every time when I see the sources from FLG, I would always ask a question: is it just a new dark page of CCP I didn’t know? Or a new method to discredit CCP using the unfounded rumors / staged videos which are not different than CCP propaganda machine? Or a new way to beg for funding from American governments and NGOs?

----- __183.1__ -----2019-11-08 07:14:27+08:00:

不仅仅是有关系，我觉得是首要原因

大一统保持了中国的体量，但禁锢了文化多元和思想交流

统治者亡了又如何？中国这个文明就亡了吗？

相反地，即使在这条时间线里面的中国，也又不是没被外族统治过

不是说你的论据错，但我们这里说的是**文明**本身

的确不高，我也赞同。但这种议题远远不是“可不可能做”，而是“应不应该去做”。就像清朝和辛亥革命一样，中国不变革，总有一天要别人来代劳，后果更严重。

这种反驳，跟你说“多元化是固定的”有什么区别？你在用“变化本身是不变的”来诡辩

> 思想文化完全是白人主导，黑人是token,华人靠边站

多元化是指开放式思维，互相尊重，理性探讨。思想文化完全白人主导有什么奇怪？现代化就是西方化，现代的东西，无论是科学等硬实力和还是文化制度意识形态等软实力，中国也是西方化，政党、法治、逻辑演绎、科学体系、马克思、电脑、西装...哪个不是西方的？鸠占鹊巢也要有个实力吧？

相反，我倒是不太懂现在中国网上那种未富先矫的看不起所有文明（包括西方）的风潮呢。。。只会重复说自己“五千年文明如何伟大”（倒也不是不伟大，我只是讨厌每天都在把五千年当论据，并且还看不起其他文明）

怕被同化是很正常的，多元是不强迫性地同化别人，但主流文化的影响可是无法避免的。就像这世界上每天都有语言消失一样，人工智能研究中就只有英文中文占主流。两者不可弄混了

而且，比如，中国国语一直在半强制性地同化方言，但是中国很多人不在乎，不是因为中国更加多元，恰恰相反，正是因为中国不讲什么西方的多元化，所以很多人无论是同化方还是被同化方都觉得是理所应当的。就像你在穆斯林国家看不到什么女权游行一样，但西方天天搞女权，难道你能以此论证穆斯林世界的女权情况比西方好吗？

我是不太担心的，本来文化就是相互交流才能更快进步。现在可不是以前那种洗人口的玩法，现在一味文化思想方面开倒车只会弄坏自己，而且中国又不是非常弱势的文化国家，所谓的文化侵略更多是政府维持自己统治的片面说辞。

不是我因为长期大一统而忘记了什么秦平六国，而是我不认为大一统对文明的思想起到很关键的作用，反而可能是负面的影响。当然，你也可以说若没打大一统那说不定肉体被消灭了何谈精神，这里更多是一个折中性的问题。强大的中央全世界都有过，但那么执着大一统的中国独一份。

几千年前，秦国灭亡楚国是入侵、佛教入主中原是入侵、琵琶传播入关也是入侵……但现在都是中华文化的一部分。现在的所谓西方文化、西方宗教、西方思想，千年后又有何区别？

There are tons of non-chinese lived in China and end up loving or hating or kinda mixed attitude towards China, and vice versa. Especially in this sub where lots of people have these experiences.

----- __191.1__ -----2019-11-07 19:55:27+08:00:

I’m Chinese. I don’t know exactly what’s going on here and doubt that picture is racism. But I can at least explain the language here.

I *guess*, it’s because Zhu Na is closed to an insulted term to China called 支那 (shina). They are not talking about 中国 (the official name of China) here. Probably the name of that pig is Zhu Na or something close (if it’s true), that is, 猪那, a combination of pig and Shina, where both are derogative terms in Chinese, no matter in mandarin or cantonese.

I don’t know how true it is. But I won’t be surprised if it’s true cuz a very small group of HK people do use this term to insult the whole Chinese people.

Source of both the term and HK usage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shina_(word)

>	Shina (支那, pronounced [ɕiꜜna]) is a largely archaic Japanese name for China. The word was originally used neutrally in both Chinese and Japanese, but came to be perceived as derogatory by the Chinese during the course of the Sino-Japanese Wars. As a result, it fell into disuse following the Second World War, was replaced by chūgoku (中国), and is now viewed as an offensive, derogatory label.[1][2]

...

>	In Hong Kong, "Jee-na", the Cantonese pronunciation of the term "Shina", is used in a derogative sense under the backdrop of ongoing local tensions between Hong Kong and Mainland China, for example by Hong Kong localist politicians Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus Leung during their controversial swearing-in as members of the Hong Kong legislature. [4] The Hong Kong Government's legal representative Benjamin Yu said that the term is "widely used by Hong Kong independence advocates"[5] and cited the Wikipedia source[6] in Court.

Edit: btw I do support the Five Demands of HK people. I understand the usage of insulted term caused by the rage towards CCP but this approach would just have a backfire to the five demands itself or even the whole democracy movement in China.

Edit2: Confirmed by another HK person that there’s NO insulting meaning in this image.

----- __191.2__ -----2019-11-07 20:33:05+08:00:

----- __191.3__ -----2019-11-07 22:40:07+08:00:

1.	I could just guess 支那/猪那 and nothing else given the pronunciation Zhu Na from the report itself (also considering the probability that the reporter’s misunderstanding of the unfamiliar Chinese pronunciation). I could be wrong tho.
2.	No matter my comment is true or not. 支那 is definitely a hot term used in HK forums such as 连登 and 高登 ([example](https://lihkg.com/thread/1698273/page/1)). You’re right that 支那 is outdated BUT except in HK. Actually I was curious that why people would still use this word.

----- __191.4__ -----2019-11-08 03:03:15+08:00:

That’s my question too. I meant, I cannot figure out exactly the meaning of *Zhu Na* tbh. But given the denounce from the mainland student saying it’s insulting China, a probable answer is that s/he is talking about a variant of *Zhi Na*, i.e. Shina, or just a typo from the reporter due to the unfamiliarity with Chinese. Anyway, it’s a shit show. NVM

This is very not true IMO because I'm Chinese and my Chinese acquaintances don't think we made good products at least several years ago, otherwise there would not be tons of Chinese love shopping in HK and the west. This cognition has been changed a bit these years due to some new Chinese brands such as DJI but that's all. 

I do agree with all the stuffs you list here cuz I live with them and hate them too. However, I may attribute them to different factors.

- On the IP violation, pollution, and uncivilized behaviors, I would attribute them more to the phase of development, which is not much different from some developed countries in the earlier phase and other contemporary third-world countries. 

- On the Nazi-like ideas, authorization favor, and narrow nationalism, I would say it's half-culture half-regime thing. The Chinese soil shaped CCP, and vice versa. But considering other successful democracies in Asia such as SK, JP, TW and so on, I wouldn't say it's exactly a gene thing. 

- The only gene thing I may agree with here is the ethnocentric blind arrogance of the middle kingdom.

That’s because America and Soviet Union stepped in as a result of territory invasion but not ill-treatment of Jews

There’s a wrong but strong consensus shared by non-western countries (including the advanced ones) that the racism thing is uniquely existing in western countries and white people due to history factors. 

But I think the people need time to improve. They will continue to learn how to get along with each other under globalization. This process should take at least hundreds of years. 

Personally I’m not that pessimistic if we look at the big picture

其实我一直觉得西媒用的集中营(concentration camp)这个名称就已经奥斯维辛集中营等同起来了

别的camp也有其专用的词，比如苏联的gulag

可能是我个人的错觉吧

新疆土著的意识形态跟中亚相近，很世俗，跟中东那些圣战士是两码事

新疆的恐袭，根源是民族问题，不是宗教问题，虽然伊斯兰经文学校等的确在提供恐袭资源，但本质还是不一样

新疆维吾尔之于中国，跟库尔德人之于土耳其，喀什米尔穆斯林之于印度，车臣之于俄罗斯，是差不多的议题（当然，这里印度可能相对而言最不像）。都是民族分裂活动，但主权国家都把其往中东穆斯林圣战士那边靠拢，赋予自己清除行动更多的合法性

可能我表达有误，我重点就是在讲外网用concentration这个词，不一点是媒体

是民族问题借着宗教原教旨主义爆发，但根源是民族，起码是有分离趋势的部分维吾尔族人

不然，怎么不见中亚的哈萨克斯坦等国有这种宗教问题。你自己都会讲泛突厥主义，突厥难道是宗教的议题吗？

至于跟宗教紧密挂钩，这不难理解。虽然维吾尔族并不等同于穆斯林，但两者的确是紧密相连的。在感受到被汉化的危机下，寻求自己宗教来加强自己特色是自然而然的事情。部分坚定分离主义的维吾尔族人，向极端组织寻求武器和人员帮助也是很自然而然之事，不然还有什么资源可以用到呢？中国中央？俄罗斯？中亚诸国？美国？（相反地，香港泛民派倒是寻求美国帮助，因为他们借诸美国力量更合适香港这一国际城市的情况。同样地，当年中共借助苏联力量，国民党借助美国力量，若我们先不说立场的话，他们本质是一样的，都是基于内部危机并且自身不够力量解决的情况下寻求外部力量的帮助）

----- __202.5__ -----2019-11-07 08:38:04+08:00:

我只是拿哈萨克斯坦举例而已，实际上整个中亚都没这个问题。

维吾尔族跟其他少数民族有三大不同点，一是维吾尔族是大族，二是最跟所谓中华民族格格不入的民族（其文化血缘体系根本就是中亚那边的），三是自己民族没有一个独立国家（不像哈萨克族等）。所以分离势力非常强是可以理解的。

你把民族问题都归结为经济问题，太过笼统了。不是说没有经济问题，人没东西做没饭吃当然要造反，但不等于说经济好了就不造反，洽洽相反，经济上去了，文化也跟着上去，文化上去了，自然思想就会更加先进反叛。你真认为维吾尔族闹分裂都是底下层吗？其实根本的组织者是维吾尔族精英和知识分子。当年热比娅可是大商人兼人大代表，结果最反动的就是她。这次新疆再教育营的导火索之一，就是维吾尔精英们编写的维吾尔语课本（据闻涵盖许多疆独思想）。不仅仅是底下层的经济不好，更为关键的是体制内部很多双面人，不然这次会搞这么大吗？

毛当年说，“知识越多越反动”，虽然我很讨厌这句话，但若从中共角度看，放在这里是贴切的。这次的再教育营，是经济与文化双管齐下，故有外媒抨击的“思想改造洗脑”和“文化种族灭绝”。

部分维吾尔族看汉人，就像当年汉人看侵华的日本殖民者一样。你认为你会因为经济好（当年东北）就不造反吗？若否，那为何对新疆的期望过于美好呢？
