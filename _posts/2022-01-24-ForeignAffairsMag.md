\[SS from the article by Michael T. Osterholm, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. and Mark Olshaker, writer and documentary filmmaker.\]

"The COVID-19 pandemic has so far followed a different pattern with the emergence of more highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants that can evade the protection and immunity afforded by vaccination and previous infection.

Beyond expertise and knowledge, trying to map out the future course of this disease requires humility. Governments and international institutions must recognize that they cannot have all the answers and prepare for the unknown."
