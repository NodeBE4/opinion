This outfit is so wrong. The Handover of Hong Kong symbolizes Beijing's lies to Hong Kong people and the deterioration of freedoms. No one should celebrate these abuses and the traumas of our people. <a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2022/06/27/famous-urinating-statue-in-brussels-will-don-hong-kong-costume-again-to-celebrate-handover-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hongkongfp.com/2022/06/27/famous-urinating-statue-in-brussels-will-don-hong-kong-costume-again-to-celebrate-handover-anniversary/</a>

1. Tmr marks the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty. To celebrate this occasion, Xi Jing Ping left mainland China for the first time since the start of the pandemic and will host ceremonies in the city. Yet, most HK people are uninterested to these events.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWfofjnXEAQvSKx?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 2. Before the arrival of Xi, protest groups were warned not to take any action. Most of the pro-democracy activists are still in jail. Some presses were barred from delegating journalists to the ceremonies for “security reasons.” These only occur in authoritarian states.

Re 3. The whole city has only one dominant voice and others are eradicated. It is quiet and "harmonious" because it has lost its political diversity and freedom of expression. It's "One Country, Two Systems" failure, not success.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWfo0qMWQAAsINJ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
