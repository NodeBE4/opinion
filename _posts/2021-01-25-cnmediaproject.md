RT Austin Ramzy<br>"When we heard the sound of the drill breaking through, everyone stood up excitedly," one of the rescued Shandong miners told state media.

China claimed last month to have lifted all of its people out of poverty. But was this just another self-fulfilled prophecy?

RT Yaqiu Wang 王亚秋<br>Sun Jiaodong had 27 followers on Twitter. In 2019, he tweeted, "glory to Hong Kong, shame on Communist bandits." He got 13 months in prison. Great reporting by @ByChunHan on the heavy punishment doled out to ordinary citizens for their speech. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-now-sending-twitter-users-to-prison-for-posts-most-chinese-cant-see-11611932917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-now-sending-twitter-users-to-prison-for-posts-most-chinese-cant-see-11611932917</a>

RT Jonathan Cheng<br>"This is the ghost of basic skepticism that haunts all of the grand claims in China’s tightly controlled press. When success is the only outcome possible, when happy endings are the order of the day, can success and positivity be trusted?"<br>@cnmediaproject <a href="https://bit.ly/3iXPS9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3iXPS9c</a>

RT Malin Oud<br>For those interested in climate and environmental issues, here’s a meaty thread by @LiShuo_GP analysing the juiciest Chinese bureaucratic document in years<br><br>Li Shuo_Greenpeace: A SIGNIFICANT move that bears HUGE political implications for China's envi governance, air pollution, & coal development. On Jan 29, the central environmental inspection group (CEIP) released findings on its inspection at the National Energy Administration (NEA).
