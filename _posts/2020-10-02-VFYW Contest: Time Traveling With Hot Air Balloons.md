(And, as always, the posts for every contest will be available in the <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/">online archive</a>.) So when you don&#8217;t receive the contest results in your inbox next Friday, just go to the emailed (or online) edition of the Dish that starts with Andrew&#8217;s column &#8212; published around 1pm EST &#8212; and scroll to the very bottom.</em></p><p>From the winner of <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/vfyw-contest-national-happiness-needed">last week&#8217;s contest</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Obviously sending you pictures of half-naked bodybuilders is a respectable strategy.&nbsp;I feel guilty that I just ripped the photo off Facebook while searching for &#8220;Bhutan gym&#8221; and didn&#8217;t give any credit: He&#8217;s Tashi Tobgyal, age 20 from the Thimphu Muscle Factory, bless him.</p><p>What to say about this week&#8217;s contest.&nbsp;It&#8217;s super easy and super hard at the same time.&nbsp;Kudos for creating a very different kind of competition, since the photo was taken years ago.&nbsp;I imagine that there will be some grumbles &#8230;</p></blockquote><p>&#8220;This one is&nbsp;SO FRUSTRATING,&#8221; a reader grumbles. I also made this week&#8217;s contest a bit more difficult by cropping out the row houses, but the full version of the photo is now seen above. This reader begins the guessing game:</p><blockquote><p>Walla Walla, Washington? A slight bit of smoke appears on the horizon and the Blue Mountains are in the background. I&#8217;m guessing that the <a href="https://wallawallaballoonstampede.com/">Walla Walla Balloon Stampede</a> was delayed this year due to Covid.</p></blockquote><p>It has been delayed, but it&#8217;s supposed to launch in a <a href="https://www.eastoregonian.com/coronavirus/balloon-stampedes-2020-takeoff-postponed-until-the-fall/article_44715530-4e98-5b80-94f2-d21ec98d47f7.html">few weeks</a>. Another reader floats east to Montana:</p><blockquote><p>This really looks like the top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimrocks">Rimrocks</a> in Billings. The picture&nbsp;would&nbsp;have been taken during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hotairballoon.com/Big-Sky-International-Balloon-Rendezvous/">Billings Balloon Festival</a>, which started in 1995 (when I was a sophomore in high school).&nbsp;I grew up in Billings and attended Skyview High School, which at the time had only been around for a few years and catered to kids from the new &#8220;Heights&#8221; neighborhood.</p></blockquote><p>Over in Kalispell, Montana, where I visited Glacier National Park and <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/vfyw-contest-readers-on-the-trail">posted a contest view from my Airstream</a> in late August, I had a close encounter with a hot air balloon being launched from the RV park &#8212; here&#8217;s a time-lapse:</p><div id="youtube2-ltW0GQf7qtY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ltW0GQf7qtY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ltW0GQf7qtY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>Another reader heads south:</p><blockquote><p>Albuquerque? Look, the chimneys don&#8217;t look right for New Mexico, and the trees don&#8217;t look right for New Mexico, but I know the semi-obscure fact that they have a <a href="https://balloonfiesta.com/Post/2020-Balloon-Fiesta-Update">hot air balloon festival</a> there, so I&#8217;m just gonna close my eyes and let it ride.</p></blockquote><p>Albuquerque&#8217;s festival is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque_International_Balloon_Fiesta">largest one in the world</a>. Another reader, another state:</p><blockquote><p>This week&#8217;s picture was taken from the top floor of the old Warren County Courthouse at the corner of Howard and Salem in Indianola, Iowa, during the <a href="https://www.nationalballoonclassic.com/">annual balloon festival</a>. The old courthouse was recently demolished to make way for a new, modern justice center.</p></blockquote><p>Another reader senses a theme:</p><blockquote><p>This week I learned that there are so many balloon festivals all over the world. I also learned that the majority of them were cancelled due to Covid. I searched as many places as I could. I kept thinking this is a photo from a European town, but again, most festivals I checked were cancelled. I did, though, see a <a href="https://www.hotairballoon.com/Macomb-Balloon-Rally/">festival in Macomb, Illinois, that was not cancelled</a>. I found a photo that looks close to the view, but &#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s wrong:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-635-1080" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe264f03-233d-49e8-acea-5c6566106a87_1080x635.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe264f03-233d-49e8-acea-5c6566106a87_1080x635.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fe264f03-233d-49e8-acea-5c6566106a87_1080x635.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:635,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72679,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-635-1080 {            padding-bottom: 58.79629629629629%;            padding-bottom: min(58.79629629629629%, 635px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-635-1080 img {            max-width: 1080px;            max-height: 635px;          }        </style></a></blockquote><p>Another reader has bittersweet memories:</p><blockquote><p>This is in the Berkshires of lovely central Massachusetts. The rolling hills bring me back to the better parts of my first marriage.</p></blockquote><p>Another jumps across the Atlantic Ocean:</p><blockquote><p>This is Cappadocia, Turkey, well known for hot air ballooning. The background looks decidedly Turkish and that it is a walled city.</p></blockquote><p>Coincidentally I was scrolling through my Instagram feed this week and spotted an amazing view of balloons in Cappadocia:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-698-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72d6d3c3-317b-41cb-91aa-55a994d3d353_1872x898.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72d6d3c3-317b-41cb-91aa-55a994d3d353_1872x898.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/72d6d3c3-317b-41cb-91aa-55a994d3d353_1872x898.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:698,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1593478,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-698-1456 {            padding-bottom: 47.93956043956044%;            padding-bottom: min(47.93956043956044%, 698px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-698-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 698px;          }        </style></a><p>The poster, Julie Rodgers, is an acquaintance of mine and Andrew&#8217;s, and she&#8217;s written some <a href="http://www.julierodgers.com/media/">wonderful pieces</a> on being a gay Christian if you&#8217;re interested (e.g. &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/conservative-christians-and-lgbtq-people-dont-have-to-be-enemies/2018/08/02/a31caabc-95d6-11e8-8ffb-5de6d5e49ada_story.html?utm_term=.c7ce01e0115b">Conservative Christians and LGBTQ People Don&#8217;t Have to Be Enemies</a>&#8221; in the WaPo).</p><p>Another reader heads west from Turkey:</p><blockquote><p>I started with a quick list of balloon events and got stuck on the Grand Est Mondial Air Balloon festival in Hag&#233;ville, France.&nbsp;However, this event is only in odd years (as in odd-even, not odd-weird &#8212; though 2020 certainly qualifies for that). The number of balloons in this View is also much fewer than the usual number in Hag&#233;ville. </p><p>I won&#8217;t be surprised if it is a little farther away in the city of Verdun &#8212; famous for the longest battle of the First World War, with 70,000 casualties a month for nearly a year.&nbsp;2020 sort of feels like the Verdun of years.</p></blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s be dun with it, amirite? Another reader looks to the balloons for clues:</p><blockquote><a class="image-link image2 image2-383-362" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce11fc38-3616-46ef-a9cc-a5fab399e2fc_362x383.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce11fc38-3616-46ef-a9cc-a5fab399e2fc_362x383.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce11fc38-3616-46ef-a9cc-a5fab399e2fc_362x383.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:383,&quot;width&quot;:362,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:33494,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-383-362 {            padding-bottom: 105.8011049723757%;            padding-bottom: min(105.8011049723757%, 383px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-383-362 img {            max-width: 362px;            max-height: 383px;          }        </style></a><p>Like other readers, I&#8217;m sure, I focused on certain balloons in the photo. The colorful one in the center for some reason made me think of the Ethiopian flag colors and sent me looking at photos of balloons in Ethiopia. Turns out it belongs to Pattersons, a store selling cleaning and catering supplies.</p></blockquote><p>Another reader also went balloon hunting:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-647-1282" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27b99524-7b60-4816-9786-77d2928472c7_1282x647.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27b99524-7b60-4816-9786-77d2928472c7_1282x647.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27b99524-7b60-4816-9786-77d2928472c7_1282x647.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:647,&quot;width&quot;:1282,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1148826,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-647-1282 {            padding-bottom: 50.46801872074883%;            padding-bottom: min(50.46801872074883%, 647px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-647-1282 img {            max-width: 1282px;            max-height: 647px;          }        </style></a><p>Another reader looks to the roof for clues:</p><blockquote><p>Last week there was the <a href="http://cecup.eu/gallery-2018/">Central European Hot Air Balloon Cup</a> in Szeged, Hungary. Beyond that, my best guess is that the&nbsp;view is from a building at the University of Szeged, since the rooftop in the foreground strike me as being like the tops of august university buildings throughout Europe. Beyond that ... ?</p></blockquote><p>Another goes beyond that:</p><blockquote><p>The first clue isn&#8217;t the balloons &#8212; lots of places have those &#8212; but the chimneys. They look European, perhaps French or Spanish. Add the second clue, the balloons, and a Google search yields Igualada, Spain, the home to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Balloon_Festival">European Balloon Festival</a>. My instinct says this answer is too easy (the roof isn&#8217;t a guaranteed&nbsp;match for Spain), but the&nbsp;geography of Igulada seems to be a reasonable&nbsp;match with the hills in the photo.</p><p>That&#8217;s where my trail runs cold. There seem to be some larger buildings off to the left, so I&#8217;m going to guess this view is to the northwest of the balloon launch site:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-821-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F100e48a4-b802-4e36-8416-2a1ae8b492ce_3580x2018.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F100e48a4-b802-4e36-8416-2a1ae8b492ce_3580x2018.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/100e48a4-b802-4e36-8416-2a1ae8b492ce_3580x2018.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:20127179,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-821-1456 {            padding-bottom: 56.387362637362635%;            padding-bottom: min(56.387362637362635%, 821px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-821-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 821px;          }        </style></a><p>I could be way off, but *fingers crossed* I hope I got the right country at least!</p></blockquote><p>Another gets the right country:</p><blockquote><p>Bradford-on-Avon, England? Not positive, but I was there just a couple of weeks ago and did see balloons. I am very positive it&#8217;s the UK: the sky shows you that, with its light blue and ever-present clouds even on a sunny late afternoon. But the giveaway is the TV aerials on brick chimneys of the terrace with lead coping.</p></blockquote><p>Another gets the right city:</p><blockquote><p>The obvious choice is&nbsp;<strong>Bristol</strong>&nbsp;because of the balloon&nbsp;fiesta held there. But I have lived in&nbsp;Bristol&nbsp;and I don&#8217;t recognise that view. The top of the hill looks exposed and slightly moor-like. It makes me think this might be somewhere in the North of England, where there are plenty of valley towns with terraced Victorian housing. But I have no idea. So I&#8217;ll actually say&nbsp;Bristol, just so I can enter the competition this week for the first time ever.</p></blockquote><p>Bristol it is, and about 50 other readers guessed that city as well. One of them gets nostalgic:</p><blockquote><p>My mother is from Bristol and we used to spend the summers with my grandparents at their house in Richmond Hill. Bristol is famous for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_International_Balloon_Fiesta">hot-air balloon festival</a>, and I have fond memories of looking out the windows and seeing balloons on clear summer days over the years or going up to the Downs to see the balloons over the Clifton Suspension Bridge.</p></blockquote><p>But which neighborhood in Bristol? &#8220;My guess would be out in the suburbs &#8212; Brislington,&#8221; a reader guesses.
