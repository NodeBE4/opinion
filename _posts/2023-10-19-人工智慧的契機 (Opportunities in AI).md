拍攝日期：2023/09/26主講人： Dr. Andrew Ng (美國史丹佛大學客座教授、Coursera共同創辦人)活動簡介AI – similar to electricity – is a General Purpose Technology with applications in all corners of the economy and all areas of society. In this presentation, I will describe some major technology trends in AI: Generative AI, beyond being a powerful consumer tool (such as ChatGPT) is also a powerful developer tool that is enabling new applications in many industries, such as finance, logistics, education, and healthcare. Low code development platforms, including ones built on generative AI, are enabling more AI applications to be built not just in the tech sector, but in the “long tail” of AI applications. Technology developed and proven out in text processing is also making its way to other types of data, including especially image data.講者介紹Andrew Ng is the Managing General Partner at AI Fund, Founder of DeepLearning.AI, Founder and CEO of Landing AI, Chairman and Co-Founder of Coursera, and an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University. As a pioneer both in machine learning and online education, Dr. Ng has changed countless lives through his work in AI, authoring or co-authoring over 200 research papers in machine learning, robotics, and related fields. He was also the founding lead of the Google Brain team, and Chief Scientist at Baidu, and through this work built the teams that led the AI transformation of two leading internet companies. ►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
