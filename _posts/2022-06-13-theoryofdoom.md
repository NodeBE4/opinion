> math is non disputable

Most of the time for normal stuff, yeah.  But sometimes there are disagreements . . . a few of which can be [hilarious](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=103).

I would change how math is taught in American public schools from the current state to how it is done in Germany, Switzerland or Japan.

This.  Not only go to the gym, but develop a routine that you can stick with.  Find some friends who also go to the gym, so you have people to hold you accountable and keep things in perspective.

### 304: [Natural Gas Could Start to Melt United Front Against Russia](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/vct1s9/natural_gas_could_start_to_melt_united_front/), submitted on 2022-06-15 20:10:29+08:00.

Submission Statement: 

This WSJ article considers the geopolitical significance of natural gas supply and futures pricing volatility to the probability of continuing coordination in opposition to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  Russia is the largest natural gas supplier to Europe, by far.  In Europe, natural gas futures are high and continue to increase.  Supply is depleted (including due to Putin's invasion of Ukraine), demand remains high and futures prices have soared as a result. In the United States, the opposite is happening in natural gas futures markets.  Stateside benchmarks saw an apx. fifteen percent drop in LNG futures prices at the same time Europe's rose by around the same amount. The article proposes that while the United States and Europe have coordinated their strategic alliance on energy markets so far, whether that continues is unclear, particularly where American exports are uncertain to offset supply shortages.

> the fact that rebellious spirits could still be born in the authoritarian nightmare hellscape of 1984

I agree.  Even if as a concept it was removed from language entirely, the human spirit would still desire freedom.

Just because you go to college does not mean you're going to get a well-paying job.  And just because you don't go to college, doesn't mean you won't get a well paying job.  I know tradesmen (especially ones who went on to start their own companies) who make more money than MBAs in mid-level positions.  I say this as one of the "over-educated" types. 

The bigger concern is two or more divergent zeitgeists/realities produced by two or more divergent normative value structures.  That's what happens when two people look at the same set of facts and reach mutually exclusive interpretations of meaning.  

In the instance discussed above, it's not difficult to make sense of how things play out over a couple of generations.  Where entire groups of people decide against reproduction, that non-continuity isn't limited to genetic information.  Cultural continuity is broken, too.  Same with their normative value structure(s). 

Is it any wonder, then, that Gen Z tends to be more conservative than [most probably realize](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-changes-political-divides-2019-7)?  Choices like this woman's above make it clear what the outcome of any culture war will be, in the long run.
