It’s been two years since @joshuawongcf was jailed. We have no idea when he can leave — no verdict yet, and govt just put an extra charge on him. <br>We must continue to voice for them and request an immediate release of all political prisoners in HK.<br>#StandwithHongKong<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiUsqb4XgAM2p9C?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
