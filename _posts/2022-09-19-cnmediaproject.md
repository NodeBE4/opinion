What happens when laws meant to protect basic safety are suspended in the name of top-down policies meant to ensure public health? CMP translates an important post on the breaking of laws behind the Guizhou bus accident. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/19/when-laws-fail-for-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/19/when-laws-fail-for-policies/</a>

Guizhou officials have pledged to investigate the causes of a deadly traffic accident over the weekend. But some of the most basic facts in the tragedy already point to the key role played by unyielding top-down Covid mandates in China. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/19/when-laws-fail-for-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/19/when-laws-fail-for-policies/</a>

The fatal crash of a quarantine transport bus in Guizhou province over the weekend has galvanized anger over China's Covid policies.

Re Also have a look at CMP's post yesterday: "When Laws Fail for Policies," about how local authorities in Guizhou ignored laws meant to ensure safety because they were hard-pressed to pursue top-down and inflexible Covid mandates. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/19/when-laws-fail-for-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/19/when-laws-fail-for-policies/</a>
