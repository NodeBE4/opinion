"The Pervasive Presence of Chinese Government Content on Douyin Trending Videos" w/ @YingdanL_kk shows >40% of trending videos on Douyin (Chinese version of TikTok) come from Chinese gov't, CCP, & official media accounts (what we call regime-affiliated accounts). ðŸ§µ<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FI1sZWMVgAAP8IY?format=png&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>Yingdan_Lu:â€‚Excited to publish my first image-as-data paper with @jenjpan! We combine analysis of video, text and metadata to examine 50K Douyin Trending videos, and find the pervasive presence of the Chinese regime to compete for attention. Also enjoyed all amazing works in this SI, yay!<br>â€‚<a href="https://twitter.com/CCR_OpenJournal/status/1472944894645874692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/CCR_OpenJournal/status/1472944894645874692</a>

Re >65% of these regime-affiliated trending videos have nothing to do with the Chinese gov't or CCP's actions / policies / programs / outcomes / achievements / ideas / orgs / people (let's label this "Propaganda").

Re Instead, videos contain human interest stories, stories about positive energy (ordinary people doing good/moral stuff), entertainment, &amp; breaking news completely unrelated to any aspect of the Chinese gov't or CCP.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FI1srlAUUAguO6R?format=png&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Do we see so much non-propaganda content because this is a proactive strategy (i.e., such videos are boosted to Trending) or because users like this content more (i.e., videos trend organically)? Early evidence suggests the former.

Re @Miranda625 @YingdanL_kk Weâ€™ve thought about it but nothing concrete. Good to know thereâ€™s interest.
