### 883: [Marcus Aurelius was born in Rome to parents from Roman families and was emperor long before the East became dominant in the Empire, yet he wrote his private diaries in Greek — why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y5ur7a/marcus_aurelius_was_born_in_rome_to_parents_from/), submitted on 2022-10-17 07:07:45+08:00.

Thank you for your response, however, we have had to remove it. A [core tenet](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fb8o/introducing_the_rules_roundtables_20_the/) of the subreddit is that it is intended as a space not merely for an answer in and of itself, but [one which provides a deeper level of explanation on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_answers) than is commonly found on other history subs. We expect that contributors are able to [place core facts in a broader context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer), and use the answer to [demonstrate their breadth of knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/) on the topic at hand.
 
If you need guidance to better understand what we are looking for in our requirements, [please consult this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/) which discusses how we evaluate answers on the subreddit, or else [reach out to us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians&subject=Inquiry%20About%20Revising%20My%20Response). Thank you for your understanding.

### 884: [Aischylos' The Persians is both the oldest surviving Greek tragedy, and the only one to portray a recent historical event. Is there a significance to this? Was there an older tradition of drama about recent events that died out? Was it a one-off experiment? Or is this just an accident of survival?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y6btt1/aischylos_the_persians_is_both_the_oldest/), submitted on 2022-10-17 21:50:57+08:00.

Thank you! A lot of context I'd previously had no idea of.

Thanks! The further reading is much appreciated.

### 885: [What are some good books to learn about the Silk Road of ancient China?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y6f4yy/what_are_some_good_books_to_learn_about_the_silk/), submitted on 2022-10-18 00:11:24+08:00.

So as ever, it is worth prefacing by noting that there has been a move by some historians of Central Asia quite recently to [do away with the 'Silk Road' concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jsb5my/whats_the_state_of_scholarship_on_the_silk_road/), amid a more general complication and problematisation of the idea that's gone on for decades. The reason you are unlikely to find accounts of *The* Silk Road is that there never actually was one – long-distance movement of goods was never really an intentional process on a specific route, but rather the emergent property of numerous intersecting local trade networks. Scott C. Levi's book in the linked answer, *The Bukharan Crisis*, is the most concentrated deconstruction of both the traditional and revised 'Silk Road' concepts out there, and my first recommendation.

That said, it's not as though there were not still phenomena that get pointed to as forming part of the 'Silk Road' in practice, and for that, Valerie Hansen's *The Silk Road: A New History* (2012) is probably your best bet for an academically solid general overview of trade networks and connections in premodern Eurasia. Frances Wood's *The Silk Road: Two Thousand Years in the Heart of Asia* (2002)... *exists*, but I've not read it myself, and Wood also became rather infamous among historians of China for her insistence that Marco Polo never went there, which is generally regarded as pseudohistory these days. Even less recommended – i.e. not at all – is Peter Frankopan's *The Silk Roads* (2015), which is half a work of Big History, and half focussed on Iran, ironically at the expense of the traditional 'Silk Road' regions of Central Asia. In all honesty, there is surprisingly little else. The 'Silk Road' is so taken for granted as an aspect of Eurasian history that there are actually quite few good treatments of it out there.

That said, if you're interested in the more general political history of the region, then James Millward's *Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang* (2006) is still the definitive treatment of the history of western Central Asia, while Christopher Beckwith's *Empires of the Silk Road* is a good overview of the steppe empires and the polities of southern Central Asia.

### 886: [Britain, Her Sister Republics, and Russia's Western Holdings in 1795](https://old.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/y7e5g4/britain_her_sister_republics_and_russias_western/), submitted on 2022-10-19 02:02:58+08:00.

----- __886.1__ -----2022-10-19 17:39:50+08:00:

I'd swap in 'Britannia' for 'Britain' – the 'ain' in 'Britain' is quite a weak syllable to stress.
