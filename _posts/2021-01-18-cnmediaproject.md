RT Kevin Schoenmakers 宋楷文<br>After Twitter put a ‘state-affiliated’ label on Chinese media, their tweets saw a big drop in likes and retweets. @CGTNOfficial, @XHNews, and @PDChina, the three accounts with the most followers, are all down more than 20%.

RT Maura Cunningham 马丽娜<br>Analysis by @cnmediaproject shows that labeling Chinese news organizations "state-affiliated media" on Twitter shows less engagement with their tweets—except for one feed that's all panda tweets.
