拍攝日期：2021/05/10主講人：賴品光（中研院原子與分子科學研究所助研究員 ）Genome editing tools are being actively investigated for therapeutic and precision diagnostic applications. Yet, studying DNA repair outcomes is time-consuming and typically requires disruption of cells for subsequent DNA sequence analyses. At the same time, extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are nanosized, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells. These EVs are capable of delivering a select subset of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids to mediate “wireless” intercellular communication without direct cell-to-cell contacts. In fact, EVs have been found to play an important role in development, disease, and therapy. However, detailed examination of EV spatiotemporal properties in vitro and in vivo have been difficult due to a lack of suitable methods. Here, I will describe our development of a series of technologies to overcome these obstacles, and further apply them to elucidate biological phenomena previously inaccessible.►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
