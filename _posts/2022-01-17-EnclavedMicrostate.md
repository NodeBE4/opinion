Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

### Introduction and Theory

I cannot claim to be a particular specialist in martial arts or in its historiography – my greatest hands-on experience has been about two years of Wing Chun I did before the age of 10; my attempts to actually look into the history of this topic has been marred by just how barren a lot of the historiography is.

But the explanation of that comparative barrenness is part of the answer to your question, because it explains how the myth has continued to have such presence and currency. As Paul Bowman puts it, when it comes to the writing of the history of martial arts, there are in effect

> two different kinds of discourse, each claiming to be knowledge: ideological and mystical, on the one hand, versus verifiable and somewhat more prosaic, on the other.

And in turn, there are distinct priorities and desires among the proponents of each. By and large, hands-on practitioners of martial arts will repeat the stories told within their own discipline(s), not least because they form part of the overall 'package' of being a practitioner. Academic historians of martial arts, however, will be looking critically at what can be verified through reliable sources, irrespective of what is believed by the practitioners. Indeed, academic *anythings* will do that – specialists in the human body, for instance, will investigate the actual, empirically verifiable effects of martial arts on the body and the mechanisms by which those effects occur, irrespective of what the specific claims made by practitioners may be.

Before continuing, it is worth making two digressions to set the scene a bit. The first is to echo Bowman's point that although these discourses are incompatible, neither is more legitimate inherently. The invented traditions of various disciplines as they exist today are nevertheless important to those disciplines as they exist, and even if they are in a sense 'lies' they are still the basis of sincerely held beliefs about particular practices; yet it is still important to have a grasp of verifiable reality when it comes to the various dimensions of martial arts.

The second is to note that the majority of contemporary historical writing on East Asian martial arts is non-academic in nature and written by present-day practitioners – [not unlike military history in the 19th and early 20th centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dca5b9/historiographic_question_what_is_new_military/f288xkw/) – with serious academic approaches being comparatively recent. However, it is quite fortunate that much of this academic material, precisely because it is competing with repeated myths and received wisdom, is relatively accessible – for instance, the journal *Martial Arts Studies* is open-access, and so too is the article I'm drawing on by Paul Bowman. What it means is that both compete in the same arena, and there is arguably no real middle ground: practitioners themselves will have difficulty accepting that their disciplines' received knowledge is at best inaccurate and at worst complete bunk; academics will understandably be miffed at the suggestion that they ought to treat this received wisdom as having equal value to what is actually verifiable.

This sets the scene for *why* the myth has persisted: for the martial arts practitioner, whether there actually was a Southern Shaolin Temple or not is irrelevant, because it did exist in the context of their own perspective on their own practiced tradition. The historian cannot change the practitioner's mind because the two are operating on different wavelengths, so to speak. As for *how*, that's a different question that we can dig into a bit.

### The History

We can, with decent certainty, say that the Qing were not particularly keen on the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan or its attendant branches, for two principal reasons. 

The first was that, like many other Eurasian powers of the Early Modern period, the Qing liked to rationalise their domains and constituents, and disliked entities that lay somewhat beyond their power. The Shaolin Monastery was only one of many Chinese Buddhist institutions over which the Qing did not necessarily exert direct control, and which which were themselves only one part of a general distrust of independent religious institutions that also broadly applied to Daoist temples. The second was that, like many Buddhist and Daoist temples with a martial arm, the Shaolin Monastery had contributed troops to support the Ming in the previous dynasty's wars, albeit against the Shun rebels of Li Zicheng rather than the Manchus in the case of Shaolin. Despite not being one of the temples that supplied troops to the 'Southern' Ming during the Qing conquest of south China (of which there were many), the Shaolin Temple was nevertheless perceived as a potential locus of Ming loyalism, not just by the Qing state itself but also by elites who objected to what they saw as illegitimate alien rule. Thanks in part to the romantic writings of resentful ex-Ming officials, there came to be a pervasive but frankly impossible myth that the Shaolin monks had rebelled against Qing rule and that the monastery's destitute state in the late 17th century was a result of imperial reprisals that had stopped just short of ordering its total dissolution.

The reality was that by the time that Qing rule extended over Henan, the Shaolin Monastery had already been in pretty dire straits. In supplying troops to the Ming to fight off Li Zicheng, the Shaolin Monastery lost many of its monks in battle against Li and his allies, but its troubles did not end there, as it was subsequently preyed on by local warlords who had emerged in the absence of Ming authority. According to local chronicles, one such warlord named Li Jiyu pretended to patronise the monastery, and at one stage requested that certain ceremonies be held for his birthday. As these were being performed, he had his troops storm the monastery, where they slaughtered the disarmed monks and destroyed much of its infrastructure. Some further damage may have been caused by the Qing army as it marched south through Henan in the 1640s. Left destitute, the monastery remained dilapidated for nearly a century, with decades of neglect under relatively apathetic Qing rule. The Qing did eventually patronise the monastery somewhat, but only from 1704 onward. These contributions could be significant, as the Yongzheng Emperor paid for substantial renovations in 1735, and in return the temple hosted the Qianlong Emperor during his first Southern Inspection in 1750. But while the core monastery saw some Qing patronage, its subsidiary shrines in the region were destroyed and dispersed as basically a final nail in the coffin for its power as a local institution. It never really regained its former prestige either, with nobody holding the post of head abbott between 1664 and *1999*. The Qing remained consistently suspicious of the monastery, which was often suspected of colluding with various dissident groups at least as late as the Eight Trigrams revolt in 1813, when official communications expressed concern that the monastery might harbour fugitive sectarian rebels.

Thanks to the earlier depredations, the Shaolin Monastery as a military entity had very much collapsed. The same chronicler who recorded the destruction of the temple by Li Jiyu reported visiting the temple some time between the late 1650s and 1670s, where he requested that two novices demonstrate their skills for him. 'Their performance was no better than that of street beggars. It was not worth watching.' While the monastery retained its legendary reputation for martial prowess, the Qing were not eager to allow it to be taken seriously; in 1775 the Qianlong Emperor officially forbade officials and officers from involving Buddhist monks in the army, in response to news that the governor of Henan had taken on Shaolin monks as army instructors. 'Having monks train his soldiers is not only beyond one’s authority,' wrote the emperor, 'it also makes him into a laughing stock.'

### The Myth

The Qing conquest of China was, to say the least, a deeply traumatic event for many Han Chinese, especially as it involved the overthrow of the Ming, a state that had built itself on 'de-Mongolification' in the wake of Yuan rule, and which had upheld a sort of cosmically-ordained division between the 'civilised' and 'barbarian' worlds, made particularly potent by the construction of the Great Wall. Manifestations of anti-Qing sentiment often came in fits and starts, but it is probably fair to say that the Qing never could – and never did – feel entirely safe from a proto-nationalist uprising by any of their non-Manchu subjects. More importantly for the purposes of analysing the history of Shaolin, many organisations in southern China that pitched themselves as anti-Qing liked, for the purposes of PR and credibility, to claim continuity with movements and entities that had resisted the Qing invasion. Perhaps most prominent among these was – indeed, is – the Heaven and Earth Society in Fujian, splinters of which became the triad crime gangs, and which claims to have been formed when the Qing invaded southern China in the 1650s. There is, in fact, no verifiable truth to this: the Heaven and Earth Society came into existence in the early 1760s as a community mutual aid organisation, and only began anti-Qing agitation later in the decade, well after their foundation. What it goes to show, though, is that stories of an anti-Shaolin reprisal by the Qing were rooted in a pervasive anti-Qing attitude that was particularly prevalent in south Chinese society.

The origin story of the Heaven and Earth Society that eventually developed involves, surprise surprise, the Shaolin Monastery, and it seems to have been at least partly responsible for cementing the narrative that the Shaolin Monastery was destroyed during the Kangxi reign (1661-1722) and its practitioners scattered across southern China. That this was specifically a *Southern* Shaolin Monastery is not always consistently clear, and other variations on the Heaven and Earth Society's version of the myth sometimes claim it was the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan. However, the idea that this was a branch monastery – given the perhaps suspect timeframe of the destruction if it was supposed to be the original one – seems nevertheless to have gained prominence as a result. This did, however, have the perhaps unintended effect of leading to *several* monasteries claiming to be the rebuilt Southern Shaolin Monastery. According to Zhou Weiliang, at least three Buddhist temples in Fujian alleged that they were entitled to the moniker, with relatively little to actually show for it. But this claim nevertheless had currency, particularly in a region and in a time where it was possible to insinuate anti-Qing connections comparatively openly and expect that the extent of public support would outweigh the risks of official opposition.

To tie this in to the Hong Kong film industry, almost of HK martial arts cinema finds its roots in Wing Chun and its practitioners – more specifically, Ip Man's branch of Wing Chun – and Wing Chun basically replicates the Heaven and Earth Society's founding myth in claiming to have originated from monks fleeing the destroyed Southern Shaolin Monastery. Judkins and Nielson argue that the claim of Shaolin origins among martial arts clans dates to at least the 1890s, when the trope also starts to appear in martial arts novels; this would track with the uptick in anti-Qing sentiments that would eventually lead to the empire's downfall, and which became particularly acute in the wake of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-5. That said, the Shaolin aspect of the Heaven and Earth Society's origin myth is attested as early as 1811, so the development in the 1890s ought to be understood as involving the adoption of this myth by martial arts groups, and not its original invention.

On top of this, modern East Asian martial arts owe a lot to Japan, in that Japanese martial arts in the early 20th century were perhaps the most formalised and professionalised, thereby setting expectations for martial arts in the rest of Asia, and also in that martial arts became a way for East Asian countries to assert a sense of identity in response to the Japanese ascendancy in the region. Before the term *Wushu* (literally 'martial arts') was established as the standard by the Communist PRC, the Nationalist ROC referred to Chinese martial arts as *Guoshu*, literally 'national arts' (or 'the national art'). As an aside, a comparable dynamic can be seen with Taekwondo, which, despite its internal narrative of being an ancient Korean art, is functionally a branch of Shōtōkan karate which was given a Korean nationalist rebranding after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, and used as part of the two new Korean states' attempts at nation-building in the post-colonial period.

Tying that back to Hong Kong, it is easy to retroject contemporary Hong Kong's tense relationship with Chinese nationhood back into the twentieth century, when the situation was actually a bit more clear-cut. Later nationalist claims of Manchu 'Sinicisation' aside, the essential foreignness of the Qing in their early decades has always been quietly understood (well, 'believed' is perhaps more appropriate), and so the story of the Shaolin monastery's destruction takes on a certain character of nationalist resistance – one with particular currency amid the rise of the Japanese Empire and the longer-term traumas this left, and also amid the continued British colonial presence in Hong Kong. Lest we forget that 1967 saw massive left-wing protests against British rule in which 51 Hongkongers were killed by British police; just four years later Bruce Lee burst onto the cinematic scene in *The Big Boss*.

An undercurrent of Chinese nationalism pervades a not insubstantial amount of Hong Kong martial arts cinema, and it is probably no surprise that Japan and the Japanese can be found as the antagonists in some of the more iconic works in the genre: 1972's *Fist of Fury* sees Bruce Lee beating up karate students in post-WW1 Shanghai; 2008's *Ip Man* is set largely during the Japanese occupation of southern China; the now somewhat obscure (but at the time quite popular) *Apkido*, also from 1972, is set in prewar, Japanese-ruled Korea. You can even find subtle hints in films that don't directly address the Japanese Empire: Bruce Lee's self-produced *Way of the Dragon* (1972 again) has a number of scenes where Bruce demonstrates the superiority of kung fu over karate, first against the employees at the restaurant he's protecting, and then against the thugs hired by the mafia boss (including Chuck Norris); Stephen Chow's *Kung Fu Hustle* (2004) evokes the overall period setting of 1940s Shanghai even if the Japanese – indeed, any sort of political or military situation – are curiously absent. Going all the way back to the Shaolin temple, then, it forms part of a motif common across the genre where kung fu isn't just a cool fighting style, it's also an assertion of (Han) Chinese resilience.
