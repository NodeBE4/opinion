Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

Where did this myth come from, and what role did it play in martial arts history?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/), submitted on 2022-01-20 15:32:31+08:00.

### Introduction and Theory

I cannot claim to be a particular specialist in martial arts or in its historiography – my greatest hands-on experience has been about two years of Wing Chun I did before the age of 10; my attempts to actually look into the history of this topic has been marred by just how barren a lot of the historiography is.

But the explanation of that comparative barrenness is part of the answer to your question, because it explains how the myth has continued to have such presence and currency. As Paul Bowman puts it, when it comes to the writing of the history of martial arts, there are in effect

> two different kinds of discourse, each claiming to be knowledge: ideological and mystical, on the one hand, versus verifiable and somewhat more prosaic, on the other.

And in turn, there are distinct priorities and desires among the proponents of each. By and large, hands-on practitioners of martial arts will repeat the stories told within their own discipline(s), not least because they form part of the overall 'package' of being a practitioner. Academic historians of martial arts, however, will be looking critically at what can be verified through reliable sources, irrespective of what is believed by the practitioners. Indeed, academic *anythings* will do that – specialists in the human, for instance, will investigate the actual, empirically verifiable effects of martial arts on the body and the mechanisms by which those effects occur, irrespective of what the specific claims made by practitioners may be.

Before continuing, it is worth making two digressions to set the scene a bit. The first is to echo Bowman's point that although these discourses are incompatible, neither is more legitimate inherently. The invented traditions of various disciplines as they exist today are nevertheless important to those disciplines as they exist, and even if they are in a sense 'lies' they are still the basis of sincerely held beliefs about particular practices; yet it is still important to have a grasp of verifiable reality when it comes to the various dimensions of martial arts.

The second is to note that the majority of contemporary historical writing on East Asian martial arts is non-academic in nature and written by present-day practitioners – [not unlike military history in the 19th and early 20th centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dca5b9/historiographic_question_what_is_new_military/f288xkw/), with serious academic approaches being comparatively recent. However, it is quite fortunate that much of this academic material, precisely because it is competing with repeated myths and received wisdom, is relatively accessible – for instance, the journal *Martial Arts Studies* is open-access, and so too is the article I'm drawing on by Paul Bowman. What it means is that both compete in the same arena, and there is arguably no real middle ground: practitioners themselves will have difficulty accepting that their disciplines' received knowledge is at best inaccurate and at worst complete bunk; academics will understandably be miffed at the suggestion that they ought to treat this received wisdom as having equal value to what is actually verifiable.

This sets the scene for *why* the myth has persisted: for the martial arts practitioner, whether there actually was a Southern Shaolin Temple or not is irrelevant, because it did exist in the context of their own perspective on their own practiced tradition. The historian cannot change the practitioner's mind because the two are operating on different wavelengths, so to speak. As for *how*, that's a different question that we can dig into a bit.

### The History

We can, with decent certainty, say that the Qing were not particularly keen on the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan or its attendant branches, for two principal reasons. 

The first was that, like many other Eurasian powers of the Early Modern period, the Qing liked to rationalise their domains and constituents, and disliked entities that lay somewhat beyond their power. The Shaolin Monastery was only one of many Chinese Buddhist institutions over which the Qing did not necessarily exert direct control, and which which were themselves only one part of a general distrust of independent religious institutions that also broadly applied to Daoist temples. The second was that, like many Buddhist and Daoist temples with a martial arm, the Shaolin Monastery had contributed troops to support the Ming in the previous dynasty's wars, albeit against the Shun rebels of Li Zicheng rather than the Manchus. Despite not being one of the temples that supplied troops to the 'Southern' Ming during the Qing conquest of south China (of which there were many), the Shaolin Temple was nevertheless perceived as a potential locus of Ming loyalism, not just by the Qing state itself but also by elites who objected to what they saw as illegitimate alien rule. Thanks in part to the romantic writings of resentful ex-Ming officials, there came to be a pervasive but frankly impossible myth that the Shaolin monks had rebelled against Qing rule and that the monastery's destitute state in the late 17th century was a result of imperial reprisals that had stopped just short of ordering its total dissolution.

The reality was that by the time that Qing rule extended over Henan, the Shaolin Monastery had already been in pretty dire straits. In supplying troops to the Ming to fight off Li Zicheng, the Shaolin Monastery lost many of its monks in battle against Li and his allies, but its troubles did not end there, as it was subsequently preyed on by local warlords who had emerged in the absence of Ming authority. According to local chronicles, one such warlord named Li Jiyu pretended to patronise the monastery, and at one stage requested that certain ceremonies be held for his birthday. As these were being performed, he had his troops storm the monastery, where they slaughtered the disarmed monks and destroyed much of its infrastructure. Some further damage may have been caused by the Qing army as it marched south through Henan in the 1640s. Left destitute, the monastery remained dilapidated for nearly a century, with decades of neglect under relatively apathetic Qing rule. The Qing did eventually patronise the monastery somewhat, but only from 1704 onward. These contributions could be significant, as the Yongzheng Emperor paid for substantial renovations in 1735, and in return the temple hosted the Qianlong Emperor during his first Southern Inspection in 1750. But while the core monastery saw some Qing patronage, its subsidiary shrines in the region were destroyed and dispersed as basically a final nail in the coffin for the Shaolin Monastery's power as a local institution. It never really regained its former prestige either, with nobody holding the post of head abbott between 1664 and *1999*. The Qing remained suspicious of the monastery, which was often suspected of colluding with various dissident groups at least as late as the Eight Trigrams revolt in 1813, when official communications expressed concern that the monastery might harbour other sectarians.

Thanks to all these earlier depredations, the Shaolin Monastery as a military entity had very much collapsed. The same chronicler who recorded the destruction of the temple by Li Jiyu reported visiting the temple some time between the late 1650s and 1670s, where he requested that two novices demonstrate their skills for him. 'Their performance was no better than that of street beggars. It was not worth watching.' While it retained a reputation for military prowess, the Qing were not eager to allow it to be taken seriously; in 1775 the Qianlong Emperor officially forbade officials and officers from involving Buddhist monks in the army, in response to news that the governor of Henan had taken on Shaolin monks as army instructors. 'Having monks train his soldiers is not only beyond one’s authority,' wrote the emperor, 'it also makes him into a laughing stock.'
