\[SS from the article by Claudia Escobar Mejía, Visiting Professor and Researcher at George Mason University and a former magistrate on the Guatemalan Court of Appeals.\]  
"This year marks the bicentennial of Central American independence from Spain and the birth of five small states: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The milestone, however, arrives at a time when the region has little to celebrate. Antidemocratic kleptocracies dominate the isthmus and Nicaragua has become an outright dictatorship. Scant economic growth and endemic corruption and violence are pushing a flood of Central American migrants to the United States.  
In the past few decades, U.S. influence in the region has waned as China and Russia have made inroads across Latin America by striking commercial, military, and diplomatic deals. The United States is still an economic superpower, however, and the main commercial partner to every country in the region. The Biden administration can and should leverage U.S. influence to promote the rule of law in Central America."
