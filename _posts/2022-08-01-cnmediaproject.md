RT‚ÄÇChenchen Zhang ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br>there are militarist nationalists disappointed that there's no war<br>there are those who go ah-qism saying "we still won (thru whatever imaginary gains)" or "believe our motherland.

Putting Pelosi in the Corner: The US House Speaker's visit to Taiwan is headline news all over the world today, and China has voiced its ‚Äústrong condemnation.‚Äù So why is the story in 5th place on the front page of the CCP‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily?‚ÄÇ<a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/03/putting-pelosi-in-the-corner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/03/putting-pelosi-in-the-corner/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZOb50CaIAAZv1F?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT‚ÄÇLev Nachman<br>For the next few days there will be increased military demonstrations around Taiwan. They have been announced for days and are demonstrations - not an attack. War is not going to break out. Please be careful not to be overly alarmist when reporting or reacting to them.

Chinese media have lined up int'l voices against US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. But these sources professing outrage have appeared in external propaganda for years -- suggesting they are borrowed voices speaking the CCP‚Äôs convictions.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/04/chinas-global-soundbite-factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/04/chinas-global-soundbite-factory/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZTqmI_aMAAIIZY?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT‚ÄÇDamien Ma<br>Just an observation. <br><br>Last couple days, Xinhua has been the "fire and brimstone" platform, live streaming stuff on Taiwan excercises for public consumption.<br><br>Meanwhile, People's Daily two days in a row has led with stabilizing the economy.

China's Global Soundbite Factory: We trace the sources quoted by the People's Daily as critical of Pelosi's Taiwan visit to show how they are regulars in Chinese state media -- and appear virtually nowhere else.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/04/chinas-global-soundbite-factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/04/chinas-global-soundbite-factory/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZWrtrFaMAEOZxz?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Continuing our series on journalist Yang Haipeng, who passed away on June 30, we look at tributes from former Jiang Yiping and Xiao Shu, which offer glimpses of what was a brighter and more hopeful era for China's journalists.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/05/looking-back-on-chinas-golden-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/05/looking-back-on-chinas-golden-era/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZXK3-daUAEsIJS?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

China's Global Soundbite Factory: The CCP has long kept a network of quotable int'l sources -- minor pol. party leaders and scholars who appear virtually nowhere outside of Chinese media.
