RT Chenchen Zhang 🤦🏻‍♀️<br>there are militarist nationalists disappointed that there's no war<br>there are those who go ah-qism saying "we still won (thru whatever imaginary gains)" or "believe our motherland. We know nothing"<br>the latter are kinda pathetically cute the war thirsty ppl are utterly terrifying

Putting Pelosi in the Corner: The US House Speaker's visit to Taiwan is headline news all over the world today, and China has voiced its “strong condemnation.” So why is the story in 5th place on the front page of the CCP’s official People’s Daily? <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/03/putting-pelosi-in-the-corner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/03/putting-pelosi-in-the-corner/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZOb50CaIAAZv1F?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Lev Nachman<br>For the next few days there will be increased military demonstrations around Taiwan. They have been announced for days and are demonstrations - not an attack. War is not going to break out. Please be careful not to be overly alarmist when reporting or reacting to them.

Chinese media have lined up int'l voices against US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. But these sources professing outrage have appeared in external propaganda for years -- suggesting they are borrowed voices speaking the CCP’s convictions. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/04/chinas-global-soundbite-factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/04/chinas-global-soundbite-factory/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZTqmI_aMAAIIZY?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
