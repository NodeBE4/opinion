### 200: [Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-03-28. 748 New Cases.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/tqf9cd/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220328_748_new_cases/), submitted on 2022-03-29 02:00:20+08:00.

Each new armageddon has failed to materialize as expected, yet people continue to expect as much.  Over and over and over again.

----- __200.2__ -----2022-03-29 08:17:42+08:00:

What, if any, justification was provided for that hypothesized "increase in cases"?  

And who communicated it?

----- __200.3__ -----2022-03-29 08:21:10+08:00:

> the word "surge" and "wave"

Neither the word "surge" nor "wave" have any epidemiological significance.  They are media buzzwords, used to characterize trends in data in more or less sensational ways. 
 Further, if you were going to see significantly increased hospitalizations, they'd have been rolling in by now.

> The signal-to-noise ratio [is too damn high] . . . .

This is correct.
