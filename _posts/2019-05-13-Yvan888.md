### 235: [Southern China right now](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/bokmoc/southern_china_right_now/), submitted on 2019-05-14 23:48:35+08:00.

----- __235.1__ -----2019-05-15 10:19:33+08:00:

hot + wet = worst

### 236: [Beijing, China](https://old.reddit.com/r/CityPorn/comments/box7ng/beijing_china/), submitted on 2019-05-15 20:16:47+08:00.

----- __236.1__ -----2019-05-17 03:17:18+08:00:

after seeing your first sentence, I expected that you would say something bad about BJ lol

----- __236.2__ -----2019-05-17 04:02:09+08:00:

oh I didn't disagree with you, I think most parts in BJ are ugly too. Actually, I think it's better to forbid the skyscraper in BJ ^(which is impossible)

### 237: [🔥 Guilin is a city in southern China known for its dramatic landscape of limestone karst hills 🔥](https://old.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/bpa2e1/guilin_is_a_city_in_southern_china_known_for_its/), submitted on 2019-05-16 16:39:26+08:00.

----- __237.1__ -----2019-05-17 02:57:59+08:00:

Am Chinese, Guilin is a must-see place in China. I haven’t searched when is the best time, but you’d better avoid summer vacation, 6.15-8.31, when you can see people-mountain-people-sea. If you can go there IMMEDIATELY, just go. Otherwise, after August. FYI.

### 238: [China pushes inter-ethnic marriage in Xinjiang assimilation drive](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/bpntzk/china_pushes_interethnic_marriage_in_xinjiang/), submitted on 2019-05-17 14:40:07+08:00.

----- __238.1__ -----2019-05-18 04:27:01+08:00:

I’m curious that how many people here knowing that, lots of Uyghurs families are forced to accept a Han ccp official living with them under the name *促进民族融合*

### 239: [Polls show many in China admire U.S. democracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/bpt3rs/polls_show_many_in_china_admire_us_democracy/), submitted on 2019-05-18 00:03:07+08:00.

----- __239.1__ -----2019-05-18 04:22:07+08:00:

When talking about Chinese preference towards American system, I think most of them refer to the law system, the transparency and so on but not significantly (American style) democracy. 

Well you may argue that it’s impossible to divide them. But still, they’re different.

----- __239.2__ -----2019-05-18 05:02:59+08:00:

I'm talking about how to translate the *Chinese preference towards American system*. The title implies that China admire US democracy based on the report which I disagree

### 240: [China after CCP](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/bq8gtp/china_after_ccp/), submitted on 2019-05-19 04:32:21+08:00.

----- __240.1__ -----2019-05-20 03:08:36+08:00:

Absolutely not the only reason. Also, this sub 95% are expats but not Chinese

### 241: [[每日新闻] 5/19 任正非: 问题不大](https://old.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/bqh1th/每日新闻_519_任正非_问题不大/), submitted on 2019-05-19 21:39:40+08:00.

----- __241.1__ -----2019-05-20 12:17:21+08:00:

5G年代，或许真有**一点点**可能另起炉灶，就像PC到手机的过渡一样

----- __241.2__ -----2019-05-20 13:09:24+08:00:

我的意思是5G是另外一个过渡时期，是真正走向物联网的一步

操作系统、app都需要新的思维新的架构

不是说华为就铁定有机会了，而是说若不是5G的关口上，那华为等中企连个渺茫机会都没有

逆全球化开始了，以后不仅中国跟美国的生态圈有别，欧洲也会建立自己的生态圈（不是完全互斥，而是对抗与合作共存），看看默克尔等人最近的讲话吧

----- __241.3__ -----2019-05-20 13:32:34+08:00:

逆全球化就不仅仅是IT和GFW了，是中国等后发国家对先发国家的追赶导致的
