### 263: [A Series of COVID-19 Cases With Findings in the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary System](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/uvzzpm/a_series_of_covid19_cases_with_findings_in_the/), submitted on 2022-05-23 21:17:02+08:00.

Removed.  Misleading.

### 264: [Is pandemic over? One-third in US survey say yes](https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/uwc8lp/is_pandemic_over_onethird_in_us_survey_say_yes/), submitted on 2022-05-24 06:32:48+08:00.

----- __264.1__ -----2022-05-24 12:46:20+08:00:

There are still numerous subreddits that run bots, to discover activity in places like this.

----- __264.2__ -----2022-05-24 19:32:13+08:00:

How?

### 265: [Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-05-24. 3988 New Cases.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/uwwvjd/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220524_3988_new/), submitted on 2022-05-25 02:00:21+08:00.

----- __265.1__ -----2022-05-25 13:02:53+08:00:

We'll see the ebb and flow for the foreseeable future.  For all intents and purposes, the pandemic is over.

### 266: [On Twitter, leftists are calling for the recent shooter to have his pictures taken down. Saying things such as " don't make shooters famous!" Is it because he's not white nor a conservative?](https://old.reddit.com/r/libsofreddit/comments/ux379g/on_twitter_leftists_are_calling_for_the_recent/), submitted on 2022-05-25 06:47:07+08:00.

----- __266.1__ -----2022-05-25 13:01:28+08:00:

I'm pretty sure the Columbine shooters weren't "conservatives" either.  But it is hard to wrap my head around how anyone can be thinking about race.  Politicizing these incidents is a cultural and moral sickness, the cure for which is neither legislative nor technological.

### 267: [Flight to Florida is still accelerating despite NY COVID-19 reopening push](https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/ux5ghw/flight_to_florida_is_still_accelerating_despite/), submitted on 2022-05-25 08:47:00+08:00.

----- __267.1__ -----2022-05-25 19:32:19+08:00:

Left-wing governors coordinated their policies so people wouldn't flee to adjacent states.  It turns out that when you destroy your state's economy based on pseudoscience, people leave.  And they don't come back.  

Which is to say nothing of how insane the democratic party has become on social issues.
