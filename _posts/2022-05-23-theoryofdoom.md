### 263: [A Series of COVID-19 Cases With Findings in the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary System](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/uvzzpm/a_series_of_covid19_cases_with_findings_in_the/), submitted on 2022-05-23 21:17:02+08:00.

Removed.  Misleading.

### 264: [Is pandemic over? One-third in US survey say yes](https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/uwc8lp/is_pandemic_over_onethird_in_us_survey_say_yes/), submitted on 2022-05-24 06:32:48+08:00.

There are still numerous subreddits that run bots, to discover activity in places like this.

----- __264.2__ -----2022-05-24 19:32:13+08:00:

How?

### 265: [Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-05-24. 3988 New Cases.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/uwwvjd/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220524_3988_new/), submitted on 2022-05-25 02:00:21+08:00.

----- __265.1__ -----2022-05-25 13:02:53+08:00:

We'll see the ebb and flow for the foreseeable future.  For all intents and purposes, the pandemic is over.

### 266: [On Twitter, leftists are calling for the recent shooter to have his pictures taken down. Saying things such as " don't make shooters famous!" Is it because he's not white nor a conservative?](https://old.reddit.com/r/libsofreddit/comments/ux379g/on_twitter_leftists_are_calling_for_the_recent/), submitted on 2022-05-25 06:47:07+08:00.

----- __266.1__ -----2022-05-25 13:01:28+08:00:

I'm pretty sure the Columbine shooters weren't "conservatives" either.  But it is hard to wrap my head around how anyone can be thinking about race.  Politicizing these incidents is a cultural and moral sickness, the cure for which is neither legislative nor technological.

### 267: [Books to restore my faith in humanity](https://old.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/ux4lr9/books_to_restore_my_faith_in_humanity/), submitted on 2022-05-25 08:00:23+08:00.

The Brother's Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoevsky.  

People are not inherently good, but most have at least some redeeming qualities.  What matters is how people choose to live their lives.

### 268: [Flight to Florida is still accelerating despite NY COVID-19 reopening push](https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/ux5ghw/flight_to_florida_is_still_accelerating_despite/), submitted on 2022-05-25 08:47:00+08:00.

----- __268.1__ -----2022-05-25 19:32:19+08:00:

Left-wing governors coordinated their policies so people wouldn't flee to adjacent states.  It turns out that when you destroy your state's economy based on pseudoscience, people leave.  And they don't come back.  

Which is to say nothing of how insane the democratic party has become on social issues.

### 269: [I’m ashamed to admit it’s been nearly a decade since I’ve read a book for pleasure. I’ll read the book in the comment with the most upvotes after 1 week.](https://old.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/ux82u8/im_ashamed_to_admit_its_been_nearly_a_decade/), submitted on 2022-05-25 11:12:17+08:00.

> You must be joking. This isn't even a top 10 must read unless you're in high school and only read the requirements.

Explain your thought process here.

### 270: [China Follows Biden Remarks by Announcing Taiwan Military Drills](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/uxfpht/china_follows_biden_remarks_by_announcing_taiwan/), submitted on 2022-05-25 19:56:49+08:00.

----- __270.1__ -----2022-05-25 20:05:12+08:00:

Submission Statement: Taiwan continues to be a fractious issue, in Sino-American bilateral relations.  Biden indicated in Tokyo that the United States would defend Taiwan militarily, in the event of any Chinese attack.  According to Wang Wenbin (Chinese foreign ministry spokesman), doing so would "incur irreparable consequences and unbearable cost."  Further threats were issued by Chinese diplomats.  For example, according to Yang Jiechi (Chinese diplomat), if the United States "goes further and further down the wrong road, it will certainly lead to a dangerous situation."

That's a surprisingly useful video.  It gets a few things wrong, but explains in an easy to understand format that is widely accessible to most.

### 271: [Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-05-25. 6406 New Cases.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/uxn572/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220525_6406_new/), submitted on 2022-05-26 02:00:18+08:00.

> Ok who’s gonna make the monkeypox tracker bot?

There won't be a need.
