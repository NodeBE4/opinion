\[SS from the article by John Mueller, Political Scientist at Ohio State University and a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute.\]

"This contemporary approach to cyberthreats resembles the aftermath of 9/11, when almost all experts believed an even larger terrorist attack would soon take place. Then, as now, the threat is overblown. Although occasionally dramatic, cyberattacks have turned out to be a comparatively minor and manageable threat. Far too much discussion around the issue focuses on worst-case scenarios, fails to contextualize the problem, and neglects to weigh the costs of cyberattacks against the enormous value of the Internet and artificial intelligence. Most commentary, moreover, does not fully appreciate the ability of the business sector—by far the most tempting of targets for malevolent hackers—to develop effective countermeasures."

Read John Mueller on why the threat of hackers mounting destabilizing cyberattacks on American energy grids, military infrastructure, and election systems is overblown.
