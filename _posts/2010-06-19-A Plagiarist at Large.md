    Plagiarists are large, human-like animals which are found in Academia. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild plagiarist had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the plagiarism were extraordinarily similar.

    The hunt for the plagiarist began in a small village where a woman picking strawberries saw ‘a large tome’ only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a plagiarist will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the plagiarist was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of conference attendance and small talks like keynote speeches. Re-prints were seen in a number of places and dust jackets were found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of ‘cut-and-paste noises’ at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the plagiarist up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal
    <em>
     was
    </em>
    a plagiarist, but where had it come from? As no plagiarist had been reported missing from any university in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the plagiarist was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.
