### 78: [Geopolitical significance of holding Ukraine ?](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ssb59w/geopolitical_significance_of_holding_ukraine/), submitted on 2022-02-14 21:53:33+08:00.

Critical mass. We can look at pipelines, maps, and mountains until we get old but we'll still miss the main reason. As Zbignew Brzezinski said, "Russia without Ukraine is not an empire. Russia with Ukraine is an empire". A very important concept in politics as a whole is "critical mass", the level of power you need to play in a big league and be functionally independent. Russia, with an economy smaller than Italy's, is not in the same league as the US and China now and desperately wants to be. Putin is tired of playing second fiddle in the anti-NATO bloc, tired of playing third fiddle in world politics, and is very aware his position is only going to worsen if Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, etc. continue to move towards the West.

The solution is to form the Eurasian Union as quickly as possible. Belarus and Kazakhstan have been taken care of through interventions that have reduced their Presidents to puppets. Ukraine must be taken by force, but is the "crown jewel" of the Russian Empire with its most valuable farmland, greatest population outside Russia proper, and greatest industrial base. Moreover the capacity of Ukrainians to form an effective insurgency is greatly overestimated by the media on account of wishful thinking. Ukraine simply means "borderland", and is a relatively new concept that only consolidated in the 20th and 21st centuries - prior to that Ukrainians called themselves "Malarossiyans" or "Little Russians", a parallel to Belarus in the North. Policed, centralized societies as a rule are not good at insurgency due to a lack of local power brokers to challenge a new government. Virtually every strong insurgency that has emerged in the past century from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Yemen was based on local tribes and strongman regimes - "societies within societies" - that predated foreign occupation. Foreigners, unlike domestic rulers, simply overestimated how much power they had once they took over the capital. The regimes before occupation spent decades convincing the international community that they were actual governments, so foreign occupiers were under the delusion they could actually govern, in the process making war upon a largely "unconquered" periphery. Ukraine attempted to revolt against Russia twice - after WW1 and WW2 - and both times failed miserably.

If Putin can conquer Ukraine, he becomes unassailable domestically and increases his nation's power by a third internationally. He halts the "march of Orangism" which is the main threat to his government, and those of the other post-Soviet oligarchies that follow him. He achieves all his goals in one fell swoop and etches his name into the annals of Russian history as a great leader. *This*, not pipelines, borders, and military camps "closer to NATO" is what he's really after.

### 79: [What's the maximum amount of economic sanctions that NATO can realistically enforce and sustain against Russia?](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/sss3z0/whats_the_maximum_amount_of_economic_sanctions/), submitted on 2022-02-15 10:32:46+08:00.

Very little. The Russian economy after the last round of sanctions is essentially driven by four vehicles: trade with China, commodity exports, energy exports, and exports of armaments and nuclear reactors. Only the middle two businesses are done with the West, and Western Europe lacks the political resolve to cut them off. Cutting Russia off from SWIFT will not work either: through the development of the Mir payment system, it has already made preparations. Moreover, this would be handing China a golden political opportunity to unite "its half" of the world under an alternative payment system, probably headquartered in a "neutral" friendly country like Malaysia. Finally, even if the West succeeds in ruining the Russian economy, China will just bail it out. The Russian economy is so small at this point that even an annual bailout of 3% of GDP (enough to restore 6% or more of annual growth) would barely make a dent on Chinese finances. Putin knows that China will do this because he's creating a distraction that benefits them, and the threat of a two front war in Ukraine and the Pacific is one of the main deterrents that keeps the US tied to the One China Policy. Based on Putin’s frequent visits to Beijing, the public declarations he and Xi have made, and his increasingly confident behavior, I have no doubt he has already obtained guarantees that China will pay him upwards of 40 billion if the West does real damage.

The Biden administration is undoubtedly aware of all of this, but has no choice because it lacks the money or political will to go to war with Russia and is just using sanctions as a hand wave to deflect political criticism and give the appearance of action.

Maybe the solution is just to not lock threads for being answered before? That implies the discussion is over just because people already talked about it. That's basically the opposite of the historian’s mindset which is that there's always new viewpoints and revisions.
