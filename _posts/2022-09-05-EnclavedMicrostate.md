### 779: [Lilikoi Laboratory Lapses - Weekly Discussion Thread, September 5th, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/x6ksfg/lilikoi_laboratory_lapses_weekly_discussion/), submitted on 2022-09-06 00:41:50+08:00.

>!With Calli, I don't think there's really a scenario where she does end up dropping it completely. A lot of her oeuvre is tied up in the Holo brand now, so graduating potentially means losing access to a huge chunk of her creative output. She's also very much someone who enjoys streaming, so even if she ends up going full pivot to music, it's not likely she'll completely give up streaming and it seems like retaining the Calli persona would help.!<

So... why not just fix it by transferring chats?

### 780: [Are there any actual evidences that the Chinese discovered America?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/x7hll5/are_there_any_actual_evidences_that_the_chinese/), submitted on 2022-09-07 02:14:26+08:00.

If he did indeed say it's 'heavily debated' then I have to say I'm rather disappointed in Jay Foreman, as this notion is about as 'heavily debated' as the idea the Earth is flat. This claim originates exclusively from the late Gavin Menzies, whose work is not remotely credible and which also serves as the vehicle for a number of racist theories, including deeply offensive claims about the origins of the Maori. I discuss these issues in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rtjx83/some_historians_suggest_that_the_chinese_mayve/hqtnt0h/).
