Chief Executive Carrie Lam once said she wanted to retire in the UK. Please don’t. Her visa should be declined as a result of her suppression of basic human rights and freedom of Hong Kong people. We should not allow perpetrators like her to walk around like they are innocent.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPfd5aaXwAUoc_a?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Glad to be a guest with @ArkadyOstrovsky and Halik Kochanski in the BBC Radio 4’s “Start of the Week.” We covered the potential of anti-war resistance in Russia, how the invasion actually recalled what Germany did in the WWII, and the resistance of Hong Kong and Chinese people.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPfz_oFXIAIvabj?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
