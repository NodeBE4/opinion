Chief Executive Carrie Lam once said she wanted to retire in the UK. Please don’t. Her visa should be declined as a result of her suppression of basic human rights and freedom of Hong Kong people. We should not allow perpetrators like her to walk around like they are innocent.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPfd5aaXwAUoc_a?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

1. Rumor says that the HK govt’s Chief Secretary (No.2) John Lee is the ideal person in Beijing’s eye and picked as the next Chief Executive. It will be a nightmare for Hong Kong people, and signal Xi's intention to continue exerting pressure on this authoritarian police state.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPqT-aOWQAQdUm8?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 2. When I was in legislature (2016 - 17), John Lee was the undersecretary of security bureau. He's already notoriously difficult to deal with. He’s consistently been the most hawkish and belligerent official in the cabinet. It's because he was from police force before this role.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPqUMxsXwAwpK4L?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. He's made many controversial speeches. He has denied any responsibility for police violence during 2019 protest; he had said the "anti-terror" campaign (including “concentration camps”) in Xinjiang is a good learning example; he headed the campaign of cracking down protests.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPqT_9qWUAAoVg8?format=png&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 4. Today, John Lee quits and begins his CE campaign, with the arrests of a trade union leader, independent journalist, and people safeguarding the truth of Tiananmen Massacre. He believes rulers have the absolute authority to do anything they want. He is evil and dictatorial.
