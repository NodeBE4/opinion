Re Tune in and listen to the introduction of Halik's amazing book "Resistance: The Underground War in Europe, 1939-45," and the amazing stories of Arkady interviewing Ukrainian President Zelensky. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00162lz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00162lz</a>
