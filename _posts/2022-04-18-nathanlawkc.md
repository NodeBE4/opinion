//Law said:“The origin of the BNO scheme was the suppression of basic freedom and human rights in Hong Kong. I believe this funding should not be awarded to organisations that support these intrusions of the Chinese government.”// <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/china-infiltrates-groups-welcoming-hongkongers-to-britain-f2w903c05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/china-infiltrates-groups-welcoming-hongkongers-to-britain-f2w903c05</a>

1. The recent controversy about pro-Beijing groups getting funding from BN(O) scheme makes me worried that the integration partners fail to understand the traits of the Hong Kong community.&nbsp;<br>To conduct a successful integration campaign for HK arrivals, we must know a few facts.

Re 2. HKers have a unique identity and community. HKers and Chinese are two distinct communities — their spoken languages, culture, and way of life are different. Understanding this difference is the most crucial step to making Hongkongers feel respected.

Re 4. HKers don’t trust the Chinese govt and organizations. The Chinese govt is a dictatorial regime that destroyed our home. Many Chinese community organizations in the UK support the political lines of CCP. More than 200 of them endorsed the National Security Law.

Re 6. We must know more about the infiltration activities of the Chinese govt and prevent these mistakes from happening. The best way is to engage with the UK-based Hong Kong community and conduct thorough background checks on the org’s connection to the Chinese embassy.  -END
