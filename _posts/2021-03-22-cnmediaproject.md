The CCP Central Committee is holding a press conference tomorrow to let everyone know how celebrations for the Party's 100th anniversary are going to go down. Should be an intriguing exercise in dullness for media discourse junkies.

RT David Paulk 波大卫<br>China news has been so gloomy lately. With journalists getting expelled or too afraid to stay, intl outlets lack the staff to go out and find quirky / light / human interest stories that many of us rely on to stay sane. Everything these days is rancorous politics, and it sucks.

RT Jun Mai<br>Re 2. What does it mean? It’s much easier to change the vice premier after the amd. Such a change won’t need to wait for an endorsement at the annual NPC session in March. The NPCSC meets every one month or two.
