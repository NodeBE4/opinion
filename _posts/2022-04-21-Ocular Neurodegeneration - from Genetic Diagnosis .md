拍攝日期：2021/11/08主講人：陳達慶（臺大醫院眼科部主治醫師）Ocular neurodegeneration is one of the major causes for irreversible blindness. Among them, inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) affects nearly 10,000 patients in Taiwan. Interdisciplinary collaboration for molecular diagnosis and innovative therapies may be the way to help patients. With the panel-based NGS diagnostic platform, we gradually disclosed the important disease-causing genes for patients of IRD in Taiwan. Till now, patients from more than 750 families were included in the Taiwan Inherited Retinal Degeneration Project (TIP) and the genetic database has been an important reference for clinical evaluation. With molecular analyses and multimodal imaging, we can better evaluate the disease progression as well as therapeutic windows for each patient / family and then trying to bridge patients to novel therapies such as gene therapies. Currently, patients of two different kinds of disease-causing genes received treatments in our hospital and our initial experiences demonstrated that gene therapy microsurgery could be safely administrated in Taiwanese. ►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
