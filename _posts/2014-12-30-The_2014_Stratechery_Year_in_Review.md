   2014 was Stratechery’s second year, and what a momentous one it was! In April Stratechery
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/welcome-stratechery-20/">
    became my full-time job
   </a>
   , and although I
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/free-stratechery-daily-email/">
    made some quick changes
   </a>
   to the model, it’s
   <a href="stratechery.com/2014/update-stratechery-membership-program/">
    been a big success
   </a>
   . It has certainly kept me busy: in 2014 I wrote 88 free articles, 169 Daily Updates, and recorded 41 podcasts (29 of them were
   <a href="http://exponent.fm">
    Exponent
   </a>
   episodes).
  </p>
  <p>
   Here are the highlights (the 2013 edition is

   The Five Most-Viewed Articles:
  </h4>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/peak-google/">
     Peak Google
    </a>
    – Google owns search, and will continue to do so. But the online ad market is about to get a lot bigger, and it’s not clear that Google will win. They may be eclipsed like Microsoft before them
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/apple-watch-asking-saying/">
     Apple Watch: Asking Why and Saying No
    </a>
    – Apple Watch is beautiful and has many compelling features, but Apple never said why it exists. Has that led them to do too much? (Note that I later changed my mind: see
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/got-wrong-apple-watch/">

    </a>

    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/smartphone-truths-samsungs-inevitable-decline/">
     Smartphone Truths and Samsung’s Inevitable Decline
    </a>
    – All of the reasons to buy high-end Samsung phones are disappearing; Apple, meanwhile, will always have software-based differentiation and a big market to address
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/time-kill-surface/">
     It’s Time to Kill Surface
    </a>
    – It’s important to evaluate products – like the Xbox and Surface – in the light of their original goals. If you do that, then it’s clear Surface has failed
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/two-microsofts/">
     Two Microsofts
    </a>
    – Making Mobile Office (nearly) free bring a lot of clarity to MIcrosoft’s business: it’s actually two different ones – consumer and enterprise

   <li>
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/messaging-mobiles-killer-app/">
     Messaging: Mobile’s Killer App
    </a>
    – Messaging is the killer app on mobile, but only LINE and WeChat have created true platforms that are true multi-sided markets (in another happy coincidence, this post was written one day before
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/social-conglomerate/">
     Facebook acquired WhatsApp
    </a>
    )

   <li>
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/netflix-net-neutrality/">
     Netflix and Net Neutrality

  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/twitter-market/">
