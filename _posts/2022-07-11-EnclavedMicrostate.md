### 601: [Flawlessly Fragrant Filipinos - Weekly Discussion Thread, July 11th, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/vwiydu/flawlessly_fragrant_filipinos_weekly_discussion/), submitted on 2022-07-11 21:52:13+08:00.

Per her ongoing stream, she knew a while ago, it seems.

I was there last year and saw a lot of Holo and zero Niji, so it'll be interesting to see a bit more diversity in VTuber-related stuff all told.

I feel there's kind of a two-way thing of on the one hand, VShojo having this whole brand identity of being an agency that's not an agency, and on the other hand, Hololive having this reputation of being the most agency-like agency, creating a bit of a double whammy: anything that's not Hololive becomes some kind of countercultural thing by default if you're into it, even if it's Nijisanji i.e. the other big agency JP-side; and VShojo capitalises on that extra hard. But it's fascinating how people buy into the hype about VShojo as this bastion of talent freedom and the notion that Cover is some kind of dictatorial 1984poration, when the reality is that both are likely more similar than that surface-level assessment suggests. VShojo is definitely a lot more lax, I'll give it that, but it also has at least some amount of staff etc. and presumably some kind of red lines, even if those are lines that the members have yet to cross.

> “In Japan, VTubing is more about idol stuff. VTubers in Japan are considered idol-like, they have to be very perfect and always on their best behavior..."

[Because idol stuff is something Veibae's own agency has never done...](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/9/93/VShojo_idols_at_VILLS_2021.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20211214083810)

### 602: [What is the influence of "Griggs VS Duke Power Co." on how companies shifted their qualification requirements for a job vacancy?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vxpjt4/what_is_the_influence_of_griggs_vs_duke_power_co/), submitted on 2022-07-13 08:08:43+08:00.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 603: [Even though sign language is not a universal language and variants exist for different languages ie Spanish sign language , Japanese, American . Do we have a definitive documentation of what was the first form of sign language used ?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vxt852/even_though_sign_language_is_not_a_universal/), submitted on 2022-07-13 11:19:23+08:00.

----- __603.1__ -----2022-07-13 15:04:00+08:00:

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 604: [Senchou & Shion: *Looks Away](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/vxtswb/senchou_shion_looks_away/), submitted on 2022-07-13 11:51:30+08:00.

----- __604.1__ -----2022-07-14 00:07:22+08:00:

They're not married though there's about 95% certainty they were a couple and probably still are, just less public about it. They dropped the married act around this time last year, though whether it's because they're not a couple or because it came off as heteronormative has been a matter of some interpretation. Since then they've been less public about the if and how of their relationship but the general implication is still there. I have a bit of a linkdump from an older comment that I may as well share here:

> Aside from the relatively well-known rings thing, they got each other White Day gifts just this year [(Noel's tweet)](https://twitter.com/shiroganenoel/status/1504414555094794243) [(Flare's tweet)](https://twitter.com/shiranuiflare/status/1504407960251887617) and mention going on dates (including in that first tweet there but also see [here](https://twitter.com/shiroganenoel/status/1447879460083040257)); other mems have noted them being, let's say *suspiciously* close [(Mio)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4SFaEuuRaU)  [(Rushia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vv2IppoFak) [(Nene)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F-gSfEIxBo); they have a collab cover up of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVdA-QCcXYc), of all the ones to choose; and there's Noel clips where she explicitly talks about how her relationship with Flare differs from her Subaru obsession such as [this](https://youtu.be/3uTbr3Qhnio?t=117) and [this](https://youtu.be/4TaTV1EQ2Zs?t=439) where she very much describes Flare as a romantic partner. Even if she's not dating Flare (which to be honest it would be an amazing set of coincidences and PR manipulation if so) Noel is pretty much 'out' given [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA9JMb6OdfQ) for instance.

So are they together? *Probably* but there's some room for reasonable doubt if you want to go there.

----- __604.2__ -----2022-07-14 00:35:17+08:00:

It's the bit where she mentions her and Flare. I also know there's a clip *somewhere* of her mentioning something along the lines that when she played with dolls as a child it was always a heroine saving the damsel, though the only version I found on later search cut that bit out and was just about her accidentally melting it by the electric heater.

### 605: [Before the popularization of nation states, how did people identify where they were from when meeting foreigners?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vxwsny/before_the_popularization_of_nation_states_how/), submitted on 2022-07-13 14:55:25+08:00.

----- __605.1__ -----2022-07-13 15:05:25+08:00:

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).
