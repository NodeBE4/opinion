Just finished my 8 hours shift on Christmas Eve with @Crisis_uk, a charity that helps people experiencing homelessness.<br>In a time of hardship, it’s also more of a time to give and care. Very blessed to be offered an opportunity to reciprocate to the community.<br>#CrisisatChristmas<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fkw0kl9XkAAWjQV?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fkw0mthWIAE4_Rv?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re I followed the rules that no photos were taken during the shift as the clients might not want it. With my injured knee, it’s also quite difficult to move around and get stuff done. <br>But it’s such a humbling experience to just be there and help.<br>Wish everyone a Merry Christmas!
