Re As a newcomer to this country, I believe we are obliged to learn more about it – its rich culture and history, as well as the changes and challenges. Chatting with the clients, serving them drinks and food are good ways to understand the complexity of the community.

Re I followed the rules that no photos were taken during the shift as the clients might not want it. With my injured knee, it’s also quite difficult to move around and get stuff done. <br>But it’s such a humbling experience to just be there and help.<br>Wish everyone a Merry Christmas!
