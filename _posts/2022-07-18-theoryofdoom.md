I used to work in biotech.  Now, I'm biotech adjacent and I trade futures and other derivatives (read: play with fire) as a hobby.

What *exactly* do you think Fauci has done "for decades"?

### 346: [Welcoming a family to Chicago](https://old.reddit.com/r/afghanistan/comments/w2sei6/welcoming_a_family_to_chicago/), submitted on 2022-07-19 21:10:51+08:00.

Welcome them to your home for hot tea, sweets and perhaps a meal.  You don't have to make anything fancy, but in my experience grilled meats, good vegetables with well prepared rice tends to be a hit no matter what.  Warm and fresh bread would be a hit too.  I wouldn't worry about being authentic, but a familiar flavor profile would be appreciated. In much the same way a Chicagoan might appreciate a combo from Portillos.  But test a recipe in advance before you serve it to guests, which I'm sure you already knew haha.  

If you are in the city, there are several good halal butchers off the Kedzie stop on the brown line.  I don't know whether they will expect halal meat or not, but if you tell them it will mean a lot.  It can be a bit more expensive in some cases, but usually prices are comparable.  And frankly, halal lamb and beef taste better to me anyway.  No pork or food containing pork products.  There are also a couple of pretty decent lebanese bakeries.  Not quite the same, but closer to familiar than an American dinner roll.  Without doubt, they will be grateful for your hospitality, whether it is good or bad.  The effort will mean a great deal to them.

If you are invited, as others have suggested, remove shoes before entering the house.  Be conscientious about physical contact, at first at least.  There is also a decently sized Afghan community here in Chicago, too.  Introduce them, show them around and let them know how to connect with resources.  I would also bring some fresh fruit, like pomegranates, some good dried dates and roughly familiar sweets.  Ask any bakery off Kedzie stop on the brown line, and they will have good recommendations for sweets.  

In my opinion --- and this is just my opinion, others may disagree --- the experience of shopping in the United States for basic necessities is so totally different than they're used to, some basic instructions on how to find decent produce would almost certainly be appreciated.  What you're going to get at Mariano's or Whole Foods might look prettier than what a village farmer brought to market, but it isn't going to taste as good either.  Even things like meats, veggis and household items aren't really bought in Afghanistan in the same way they are here.

> We are going to say “No” three times before we accept anything, especially food and drink.

This should be emphasized. The cultural norms are very different in accepting things.  Of course after three times, they will accept.  But this is not something Americans will recognize or understand at first.  

> Biscuits are good. 

I assume you are not referring to American biscuits.  But sweets, like butter cookies.  I have also found that homemade (not from a box) American pound cake with walnuts was a big hit.

----- __346.3__ -----2022-07-21 08:19:07+08:00:

Totally agree.  Very good advice.  More likely to find familiar things there, too.

### 347: [What is a stereotype that you're willing to admit about your own race/ethnicity?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/w31i3g/what_is_a_stereotype_that_youre_willing_to_admit/), submitted on 2022-07-20 03:42:29+08:00.

----- __347.1__ -----2022-07-21 13:33:25+08:00:

Ethnicity: 

* Work a lot and do so very efficiently;
* Process-oriented, methodical, calculating and deliberate; 
* Prefer order to chaos or uncertainty; 
* Only drink sparkling water (a four-week supply of which I usually maintain at all times);
* Very punctual; 
* Speak very directly, can be blunt, little sense of humor (irony, self deprecation and sarcasm do not comport);
* Reserved (I have never been accused of being the life of any party, most of my friends would describe me as "cerebral");
* Always concerned about privacy, health and safety; 
* Environmentally conscientious, prefer the natural world to alternatives;
* Very well traveled; 
* Not very romantic and not very good at romantic gestures; and
* Birkenstocks and pickled vegetables.

Not precisely relevant to COVID, but an adjacent development with potentially overlapping concerns.  We will allow this.

### 350: [Congratulations everyone! We passed 500k community members!](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/w4snz3/congratulations_everyone_we_passed_500k_community/), submitted on 2022-07-22 05:42:57+08:00.

----- __350.1__ -----2022-07-25 05:18:58+08:00:

I agree with all of this.  How would you solve the problem?

----- __350.2__ -----2022-07-27 10:57:26+08:00:

> Get moderators that are familiar with a topic like AskHistorians.

Some of us have subject matter expertise.  But others do not.  In my experience on this side of the isle, I can see how that creates problems from a slightly different vantage.  

But from your experience here, why do you think adding more moderators with subject matter expertise would improve /r/geopolitics?  

Again, I have a couple of ideas myself, but I'd be curious to hear your thoughts first.  

> Remove the ****pedia ban.  

We allow most non-blogspam sources.  What harm do you think is caused by banning Wikipedia? How do you think removing the ban will improve the subreddit? 

> Don't allow youtube channels as post like Caspian Report. The problem is many of the channels are inaccurate for many regions of the world.

We rarely allow videos.  And I agree with you on Caspian Report.  Shirvan is a nice kid and I appreciate his interest in the subject, but I think most would agree his content isn't appropriate here.  But it might be some day.  As I am fairly sure he subscribes here, I'd encourage him to continue growing and developing.

> Update the rules and wiki. There has to be an explainer on the difference between IR vs Geopolitics

As to the rules, when you say "update," what are you envisioning?  Simplifying them?  Clarifying them?  Many are cumulative, poorly worded and vague.  Is that what you had in mind?  Or something else? 

As to the wiki, that's probably a good idea.
