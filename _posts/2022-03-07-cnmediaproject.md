Re-framing the global discourse on democracy is a long-term strategy for the CCP, which hopes to shift the focus from rights-based participation to measures of results-driven government trust. Citing Western surveys, China is claiming the results are in. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/10/western-surveys-for-chinese-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/10/western-surveys-for-chinese-democracy/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNenOevaIAA9mPH?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Christian Goebel<br>👍Great work! I've only scanned the first part that traces the changing contours of labour protests in the last decade and like how descriptive statistics are interwoven with individual stories and explanations of the factors responsible for the changing dynamics.<br><br>CLB: 1/ Our report is out now! “Reimagining Workers’ Rights in China” covers a lot of ground by thematically telling the individual stories of China's workers to illustrate that today's policy challenges have a solution: in China's workers themselves.<br> <a href="https://clb.org.hk/content/clb-report-reimagining-workers%E2%80%99-rights-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://clb.org.hk/content/clb-report-reimagining-workers%E2%80%99-rights-china</a>

CMP's latest from Stella Chen, a look at how China is committed to changing the global discourse on democracy, and its reliance on ideas of "trust" and the Western surveys to support them. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/10/western-surveys-for-chinese-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/03/10/western-surveys-for-chinese-democracy/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNiD2eJacAUl9jQ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re As the CCP stresses "results" and the "trust" they bring as the basis of its "democratic" credentials its crucial to remember the fundamental role of propaganda in the system. The CCP-led system emphasizes success framing from the very start.

Re Campaigns to advertise policy victories aren't responsive to success but anticipate it, and the propaganda planning reflects this. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/04/18/the-ccps-2021-propaganda-blueprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/04/18/the-ccps-2021-propaganda-blueprint/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNiFLLlagAIejoy?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re And despite the focus in the democracy talk from China on popular sentiment, or minxin (民心), much of the propaganda declaring results is actually focused on loyalty signaling for the top leadership.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNiHN3GaMAETk4W?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The vast media control and propaganda system is often neglected in discussions of Chinese governance and performance outside China, and it is arguably the real "secret code" (密码), to use a preferred term from recent democracy discourse, of China's system.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNiIWZJaMAATMXc?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
