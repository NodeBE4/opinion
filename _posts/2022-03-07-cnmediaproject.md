Re As the CCP stresses "results" and the "trust" they bring as the basis of its "democratic" credentials its crucial to remember the fundamental role of propaganda in the system.

The conflict in Ukraine is "Russia's war" in much of the world. In many Chinese media it is a "special military operation." In this closer look at Chinese media coverage, CMP documents this official framing, but also finds some encouraging exceptions.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://bit.ly/35Px3mo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/35Px3mo</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNnnqvFaQAAmZcY?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Typical "war" use directed at the US and the West in Chinese coverage is from the Global Times using "special military operation." War is US-related:  "If this measure [sanctions] is put into action, it will inevitably further anger Russia and increase the risk of war spillover."
