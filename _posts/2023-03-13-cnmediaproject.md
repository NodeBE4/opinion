The phrase "Seeking Progress in Stability" (Á®≥‰∏≠Ê±ÇËøõ), which encompasses the idea China must proceed cautiously with economic development given persistent domestic and global uncertainties, has been big at the NPC.

Re @qianjinghua @SixthTone Sorry, just wondering how this links to China Media Project research? Could you be mistaken there? Can't spot any links or references, and this is not an area we've addressed.

RT‚ÄÇMary Gallagher<br>Funny (but not funny haha) that this Ohio bill bans cooperation with China, but then also requires that syllabi and lectures are vettable so that the state gov't can police academic speech. Which is very similar to what the CCP does to syllabi in China. ü§î Another own goal.<div class="rsshub-quote"><br><br>Benjamin McKean:‚ÄÇthe bill not only requires ‚Äúschools to publish online syllabuses for all their classes‚Äù and specifies they be ‚Äúsearchable by keywords or phrases,‚Äù it says syllabi must include ‚Äúa general description‚Ä¶of each lecture‚Äù and ‚ÄúBiographical information on the instructor‚Äù<br></div>

Re @qianjinghua @SixthTone @thechinaproj No, this is true. It's unfortunate that while we have almost a 20-year history, this was not considered in whatever professional branding exercise happened there.

Is a "newspaper" that spends far more on advertising than reporting and is funded almost entirely by a government's "Foreign Propaganda" group still a newspaper?<br><br>We dive into China Daily's latest FARA filings to find out what business they are really in.<br><br>https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/03/16/the-ins-and-outs-of-the-china-daily-usa/

This type of challenge concerning state media has also been discussed by ex-CPJ head @JoelSimonSays.

Re @rhokilpatrick explores the most recent FARA filings for China Daily in the US, and raises those basic questions crucial always to bear in mind: who is behind this "newspaper," and what is it really all about?  https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/03/16/the-ins-and-outs-of-the-china-daily-usa/

China Daily USA makes no profit, spends little on reporting, and outsources printing to major American newspapers in the markets where editions are distributed. @rhokilpatrick dives into the latest figures reported to the US gov.  https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/03/16/the-ins-and-outs-of-the-china-daily-usa/
