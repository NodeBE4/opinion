### 341: [How to Get a Breakthrough in Ukraine: The Case Against Incrementalism - Michael McFaul](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/10p4nwv/how_to_get_a_breakthrough_in_ukraine_the_case/), submitted on 2023-01-30 22:52:46+08:00.

**Short Summary**: "Western leaders need to shift how they approach the Ukraine conflict. At this stage, incrementally expanding military and economic assistance is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely. Instead, in 2023, the United States, NATO, and the democratic world more broadly should aim to support a breakthrough. This means more advanced weapons, more sanctions against Russia, and more economic aid to Ukraine. None of this should be doled out incrementally. It needs to be provided swiftly, so that Ukraine can win decisively on the battlefield this year. Without greater and immediate support, the war will settle into a stalemate, which is only to Putin’s advantage. In the end, the West will be judged by what happened during the last year of the war, not by what happened in the first."
