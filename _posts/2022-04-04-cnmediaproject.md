Tagged on Twitter: New labels on the popular social networking service warn users to reconsider before sharing content from “state-affiliated media.” But are these labels overreaching in ways that could limit the spread of some of China’s best reporting? <a href="https://bit.ly/3j1Iuud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3j1Iuud</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPesKG2agAU2xau?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Great new must-read piece from @schoenmakersk. "Twitter said the new labels and related measures 'have made a difference, contributing to a 30 percent reduction of the reach of this content.'”

President Who? Ukrainian President Zelensky has been very conspicuously absent from the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party -- a salient illustration of China's alignment with Russia. <a href="https://bit.ly/3tY1VKH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3tY1VKH</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPe33keacAIwEUf?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Christian Goebel<br>Remarkable that #Bucha 布查/布恰 does not seem to have been blacklisted on Weibo so far. More than 24 hours later, even some high-engagement posts that don't align with state media narratives remain online.

RT Roy Ngerng 鄞義林<br>I grew up in an authoritarian regime, and you have to understand, the only way people can survive is if they learn to lie to themselves, and learn to make themselves believe in the government's lies. Even after I was sued by the prime minister, that was how my relatives coped.

Prominent play in official Chinese media lately to the phrase "seeking progress in stability" 稳中求进.
