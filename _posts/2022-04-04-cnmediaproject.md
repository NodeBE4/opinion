Tagged on Twitter: New labels on the popular social networking service warn users to reconsider before sharing content from “state-affiliated media.” But are these labels overreaching in ways that could limit the spread of some of China’s best reporting? <a href="https://bit.ly/3j1Iuud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3j1Iuud</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPesKG2agAU2xau?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

President Who? Ukrainian President Zelensky has been very conspicuously absent from the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party -- a salient illustration of China's alignment with Russia. <a href="https://bit.ly/3tY1VKH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3tY1VKH</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPe33keacAIwEUf?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Christian Goebel<br>Remarkable that #Bucha 布查/布恰 does not seem to have been blacklisted on Weibo so far. More than 24 hours later, even some high-engagement posts that don't align with state media narratives remain online.

Weighing The Costs of Russia’s War: As horrific accounts emerge of Russian atrocities in Ukraine, the CCP's flagship paper focusses away from these brutal facts, centering attention instead on the supposed financial atrocities committed by the US. <a href="https://bit.ly/3J7RloM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3J7RloM</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPpcIznacAE1a9f?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The People's Daily has thrown out a new phrase, “financial terrorism” (金融恐怖主义), to refer to US sanctions against Russia. . . This occurs alongside other rhetorical barbs like “economic hegemonism” (经济霸权主义) and “economic weaponization” (经济武器化).

Re The People's Daily actually registered China's support for "economic weapons" against the USSR in March 1979. Quite at odds with the current sentiment on Russia's aggression in Ukraine . . . .<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPpe2OLacAAGQQH?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 1979: "Today, the situation requires all peace-loving countries and peoples to unite and establish a broad united front against Soviet hegemony, taking effective and practical steps to deal with the Soviet Union’s aggressive expansion and disrupt its global strategic deployment."
