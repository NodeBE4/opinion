Tagged on Twitter: New labels on the popular social networking service warn users to reconsider before sharing content from “state-affiliated media.” But are these labels overreaching in ways that could limit the spread of some of China’s best reporting? <a href="https://bit.ly/3j1Iuud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3j1Iuud</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPesKG2agAU2xau?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The People's Daily has thrown out a new phrase, “financial terrorism” (金融恐怖主义), to refer to US sanctions against Russia. . . This occurs alongside other rhetorical barbs like “economic hegemonism” (经济霸权主义) and “economic weaponization” (经济武器化).
