The upcoming voting for legislators in Hong Kong is a “selection.” <br>Only ~20% of the seats are popularly contested and candidates were vetted by political police. Figures representing people have no hope of running.<br><br>We should boycott the SELECTION— asking it is ILLEGAL in HK now<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FGc8NxDX0AEe3rX?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

A powerful piece from my friend @joshrogin on why we should help Hong Kong exiled democratic activists. <br>@SunnyCheungky @jooeysiiu @hkdc_us @hk_watch <br>// Their struggle could last decades. We must show them they are not fighting alone.//<br>#StandwithHongKong <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/16/hong-kongs-freedom-fighters-need-our-help/?tid=ss_tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/16/hong-kongs-freedom-fighters-need-our-help/?tid=ss_tw</a>
