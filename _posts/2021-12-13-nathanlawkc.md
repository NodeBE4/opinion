The upcoming voting for legislators in Hong Kong is a “selection.” <br>Only ~20% of the seats are popularly contested and candidates were vetted by political police. Figures representing people have no hope of running.<br><br>We should boycott the SELECTION— asking it is ILLEGAL in HK now<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FGc8NxDX0AEe3rX?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

A powerful piece from my friend @joshrogin on why we should help Hong Kong exiled democratic activists. <br>@SunnyCheungky @jooeysiiu @hkdc_us @hk_watch <br>// Their struggle could last decades. We must show them they are not fighting alone.//<br>#StandwithHongKong <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/16/hong-kongs-freedom-fighters-need-our-help/?tid=ss_tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/16/hong-kongs-freedom-fighters-need-our-help/?tid=ss_tw</a>

“Candidates are thoroughly screened by political police and they had to have support from pro-Beijing politicians. The popularly elected seats have drastically reduced to only 20％. We should not give any legitimacy to this election by voting.” <a href="https://aje.io/4ehswu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aje.io/4ehswu</a>

We're not helping govt to redefine democracy.<br><br>//Despite the ubiquitous advertisements from the government, election sentiment in the public has never felt so low.<br>People do not want to vote for a rubber-stamp chamber and pretend everything is all right.// <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/18/opinion/hong-kong-election.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/18/opinion/hong-kong-election.html?smid=tw-share</a>
