One of the most charming places there is Queenstown, which is around a lake and mountains. So for those reasons, and none other, I&#8217;m guessing Queenstown.</p></blockquote><p>Only 11,942 miles off. Another reader gets closer:</p><blockquote><p>The cars, bus, etc seem European. The church-ish building looks Scandinavian. The environment doesn&#8217;t seem as harsh as Iceland, Greenland, Faroe, etc. Denmark is too flat for the hills in the background and Norway is too hilly (except maybe around Oslo?). Finland is too forest-y.</p><p>So I&#8217;m a bit confused, and like a lot of other things in my life I&#8217;m leaving this halfway done as well. My money is on some small coastal town in Sweden.</p></blockquote><p>Another reader gets us island hopping:</p><blockquote><p>I instantly thought of Iceland: the clouds, the tree-less hills, the houses (though they&#8217;re not quite colorful enough to be a central part of Reykjavik). The tiny bus in the background looks like the standard Iceland bus.</p></blockquote><p>Another interprets the bus differently:</p><blockquote><p>The National Express bus suggests we&#8217;re in the United Kingdom, and the colorful buildings and rolling hills certainly look like Wales. I can&#8217;t narrow it down more than that, so I have no choice but to guess Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch &#8212; the town with the longest name in Europe and the one-time home of actress Naomi Watts. </p></blockquote><p>That reader also sends the following video &#8212; the most charming thing you&#8217;ll see on the Internet today:</p><div id="youtube2-fHxO0UdpoxM" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;fHxO0UdpoxM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fHxO0UdpoxM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>This reader is less eloquent: </p><blockquote><p>This is the northern UK. Not exactly sure where, but in some place where they say &#8220;Bloo&#8217;y &#8216;ell, mate!&#8221; a lot.</p></blockquote><p>Another reader:</p><blockquote><p>The photo looks like it could have been taken in any number of places in England, Wales, Scotland or Ireland (or Northern Ireland). So I&#8217;ll compromise and pick a spot in the middle: Ramsey, Isle of Man.</p></blockquote><p>Another gets to the right country:</p><blockquote><p>From the plant life, to the church spire that resembles St. Michaels, I am going to have to say Sneem, <strong>Ireland</strong>.&nbsp;If not Sneem, then somewhere on Ring of Kerry. Slainte!</p></blockquote><p>Another gets the right county:</p><blockquote><p>Weird when you have a sense you&#8217;ve driven past one of the windows in the contest,&nbsp;but the background doesn&#8217;t quite match up. My guess is somewhere along the Tralee Canal, in <strong>County Kerry</strong>, Ireland.</p></blockquote><p>Another gets the right town:</p><blockquote><p>Astonishingly and frighteningly, I have deduced that the photo was taken in&nbsp;<strong>Dingle</strong>, County Kerry, Ireland. Which, according to <a href="http://tripsavvy.com/">tripsavvy.com</a>, is the second-best small town in Ireland.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>A &#8220;first-time entrant in the contest, long-time reader&#8221; sends a bit of trivia about the town:</p><blockquote><p>This is Dingle&nbsp;(AKA an Daingean U&#237; Ch&#250;is), County Kerry (AKA Ciarra&#237;), Ireland (AKA &#201;ire). The actual name of this village and in what language(s) the signage should appear has been controversial in Ireland, as your readers may be interested to&nbsp;know. A good outline of that whole saga is <a href="http://www.dinglename.com/dingle.htm">here</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Another reader got help from a book:</p><blockquote><p>I remembered a brilliant little book called <em><a href="https://geni.us/iRSXmqf">The Summer Isles</a></em> by Philip Marsden. He sails up the west coast of Ireland and Scotland, exploring the history of early Celtic Christianity and the mythology of islands on the Atlantic fringe. Something about the church spire reminded me of the book. So I looked up a few of his stops, and realised that was&nbsp;Dingle&nbsp;harbour.</p></blockquote><p>Another reader squints at the tower across the harbor:</p><blockquote><p>Adding Ireland to my search turned up a similar tower on St. Mary&#8217;s Church in&nbsp;Dingle. Arriving on Google Earth, it showed just the kind of ocean inlet that our photographer looked across. Zoom down on St. Mary&#8217;s and there&#8217;s our tower:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-891-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd382c7ed-172b-442b-abe0-4213336a367b_1648x1009.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd382c7ed-172b-442b-abe0-4213336a367b_1648x1009.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d382c7ed-172b-442b-abe0-4213336a367b_1648x1009.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:891,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1592251,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-891-1456 {            padding-bottom: 61.19505494505495%;            padding-bottom: min(61.19505494505495%, 891px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-891-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 891px;          }        </style></a></blockquote><p>Another reader pinpoints the right building:</p><blockquote><p>So, this is my first attempt at VFYW &#8212; a challenge that my partner shared with me (he knows I&#8217;m wistful for travel these days ... ). Immediately, the view tugged on my memories of a road trip along the coast of Ireland &#8212; the fenlands, the brightly painted houses, the walled fields, the tour buses crowding the already narrow streets.&nbsp;Looking for larger coastal towns, I found myself (again!) in&nbsp;Dingle. The view from the window of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.clonmara.com/">Clonmara B&amp;B</a>&nbsp;(Milltown,&nbsp;Dingle, Co. Kerry;&nbsp;52.1392369125076" N, 10.2884495258331" W)</p></blockquote><p>Thirty other readers also got Clonmara B&amp;B, and most of them nailed the right window. One of them got there in a flight simulator:</p><blockquote><a class="image-link image2 image2-1198-1100" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d39813-9502-4926-9fbe-1347874f432c_1100x1198.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39d39813-9502-4926-9fbe-1347874f432c_1100x1198.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39d39813-9502-4926-9fbe-1347874f432c_1100x1198.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1198,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1383794,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-1198-1100 {            padding-bottom: 108.9090909090909%;            padding-bottom: min(108.9090909090909%, 1198px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-1198-1100 img {            max-width: 1100px;            max-height: 1198px;          }        </style></a><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/flight-simulator-2020-uncanny-escapism/">It&#8217;s a Microsoft thing</a>.&nbsp;If you get the chance, do try it out &#8212; it&#8217;s the perfect therapy for wanderlust in this locked-down age. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The simulator will probably appeal to this Irish native:</p><blockquote><p>I may be living in the US for almost 20 years, but there is nowhere else on earth like the west coast of the Emerald&nbsp;Isle. In this overhead screenshot, note the wonderful ring fort just behind this house &#8212; Ireland is dotted with these ancient structures:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-767-1002" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f91432f-8122-4013-b7f6-2dac0c28aa59_1002x767.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f91432f-8122-4013-b7f6-2dac0c28aa59_1002x767.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2f91432f-8122-4013-b7f6-2dac0c28aa59_1002x767.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:767,&quot;width&quot;:1002,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1650501,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-767-1002 {            padding-bottom: 76.54690618762476%;            padding-bottom: min(76.54690618762476%, 767px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-767-1002 img {            max-width: 1002px;            max-height: 767px;          }        </style></a><p>This contest was bittersweet, as I was due to visit&nbsp;Dingle&nbsp;as part of a larger Irish west-coast trip planned for my family this past July. I looked forward to being a tourist in my own country with my US-born kids, but the plan was scuppered by the pandemic. I&#8217;m from the north of the island and have never been to County Kerry. Next year hopefully!</p></blockquote><p>Chini, the all-time champion of the contest, is especially impressed by this week&#8217;s window: </p><blockquote><p>If the Dish team ever puts together a second VFYW book, this one might qualify for the cover. Kudos to whoever took it &#8212; perfectly framed, good light and plenty of little details in the scene. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in looking for the location I forget to enjoy what views like these provide: a perfect little window into another reader&#8217;s world.</p><p>This week&#8217;s view comes from the Clonmara B&amp;B and looks east northeast along a heading of 70.92 degrees. An overhead shot:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-781-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec3cb0a-ceec-4d48-adc8-f8fb17704b0f_2197x1179.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec3cb0a-ceec-4d48-adc8-f8fb17704b0f_2197x1179.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ec3cb0a-ceec-4d48-adc8-f8fb17704b0f_2197x1179.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:781,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2635456,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-781-1456 {            padding-bottom: 53.64010989010989%;            padding-bottom: min(53.64010989010989%, 781px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-781-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 781px;          }        </style></a></blockquote><p>Another reader gets on the phone:</p><blockquote><p>I saw this week&#8217;s picture and thought, &#8220;easy, Scotland or Ireland&#8221;.&nbsp; With those green hills and deep tides, it had to be one of those two. Half of my weekend later, I&#8217;d very nearly given up hope when I happened up the blog of a British retiree, who&#8217;d taken a photo from his window in &#8220;the lavender room&#8221; of the Clonmara B&amp;B. Upon further enquiry via a call to the proprietor, I learned that the Lavender Room indeed has a number, and it is&nbsp;room #3. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Hopefully this contest will bring some business to Clonmara B&amp;B &#8212; though it&#8217;s so beautiful that it&#8217;s probably not needed. A reader adds, &#8220;The proprietors will perhaps be wondering by Friday why their charming YouTube video has got a lot more views this week&#8221;:</p><div id="youtube2-fqG06PA8xNk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;fqG06PA8xNk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fqG06PA8xNk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>Our contest poet chimes in:</p><blockquote><p>The name of this lodge is Clonmara,<br>Rent weekly, or just til tomorra!<br>They&#8217;ve hung out their shingle,<br>In Kerry and&nbsp;Dingle,<br>Where ne&#8217;er is there sadness nor sorra!</p></blockquote><p>The reader who submitted the Dingle photo also wrote a poem:</p><blockquote><p>When I stayed at Clonmara, the woman who owned it told me it was the house she had grown up in.&nbsp;As a girl in the late 1960s, MGM rented the house for Robert Mitchum to live in while filming <em>Ryan&#8217;s Daughter</em>.&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-T0qXgUvQo2s" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;T0qXgUvQo2s&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T0qXgUvQo2s?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>The film was only supposed to take four months to shoot, but as is typical of movie shoots, it took over a year to complete. When they finally moved back in, she said the place was filled with empty whiskey bottles and cigarette burns. MGM made it right and restored it to its glory.</p><p>I wrote a poem, which I shared with the owner.</p><p><strong>Clonmara </strong></p><p>In a town named Dingle, a house lives by the sea. <br>Resting on a blanket, of softest emerald earth, <br>old and fearsome spirits learn to give it berth. </p><p>Silent rays of sunshine clouded through with rain, <br>decided on occasion to bless it with a name. <br>Clonmara is they called it for sitting by the bay. </p><p>Now in time a film crew journeyed through one day, <br>stopping by Clonmara, where it be they stay.<br>And a great known actor, blessed with such a name, </p><p>Robert Mitchum met her, and found her very game. <br>Then one day it happened, that Robert fell away,<br>and lacking him a body, Clonmara invited him to stay. </p><p>Now, when visiting Clonmara,<br>you hear a rattling sway,<br>know it&#8217;s dear old Robert shooing you away. </p><p>But pay no heed to Robert rattling away, <br>tis just the clink of whiskey bottles<br>from some long, forgotten stay. </p></blockquote><p>On a less refined note, as the son of two Army officers, I couldn&#8217;t get <a href="https://www.armystudyguide.com/content/cadence/running_cadence/dingle-dangle.shtml">this poem</a> out of my head this week, namely the line, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let your dingle dangle dangle in the dirt / pick up your dingle dangle, tie it to your shirt.&#8221;</p><p>Soooo &#8230; who&#8217;s the winner this week, out of so many correct entries? The prize goes to a long-time contestant who nearly won years ago &#8212; and she has a remarkable story:</p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a joy (of sorts) being back on the VFYW train. My first ID was one back in 2013 &#8212; <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/04/02/the-view-from-your-window-contest-winner-147/">City Hotel in Tirana, Albania</a>.&nbsp;I&nbsp;missed the correct answer due&nbsp;to&nbsp;guessing the wrong room, only&nbsp;to&nbsp;find out later that&nbsp;I&nbsp;had gotten the wrong number from&nbsp;the staff member who e-mailed me back. Oops! </p><p>But funny enough, a few months later&nbsp;I&nbsp;was invited&nbsp;to&nbsp;serve in Peace Corps Albania. When my family came&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit, my mother (a reader and VFYW follower) booked rooms at City Hotel, including *the* room itself. We enjoyed the novelty of sharing the view, and my family loved Albania. As did&nbsp;I!&nbsp;I&nbsp;miss it every day, four years after leaving, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am still amused&nbsp;to&nbsp;remember the harbinger of my new home via a VFYW.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, this week's view: it&#8217;s the <strong>Clonmara Bed and Breakfast in&nbsp;Dingle, County Kerry, Ireland</strong>. Would you believe that it&#8217;s the very first place&nbsp;I&nbsp;checked?&nbsp;I&nbsp;got the strong impression it was Ireland, Scotland, or Wales and decided to start with Ireland based on the architecture.

My wife flew from DC on her law school&nbsp;Spring Break. We took a train to Farranfore then walked to the Kerry airport, luggage in tow in the Irish early spring.
