Just a note: political reports generally do not address current affairs concretely. So 3 would be expected. References oblique.<br><br>Kristin Shi-Kupfer: My 3 main impression re: party congress speech read by #XiJinping<br>1.  Heavy ideological (incl. more recent "modernization Chinese style") and "national security" framing<br>2. Points on employment/talent policy (Li Keqiang influence? <br>3. Nothing on Russia &amp; war #china #ccp<br>

Re Example: US not mentioned, but reference to 不怕鬼 could be read as oblique US reference.

It's all about broad strokes and signals. So yes, those reading it like a blueprint are misguided. Unfortunately, there's a market for insights that aren't there. :)<br><br>Xifan Yang 杨希璠: Given how little the CCP delivers on what it promises (poverty alleviation, common prosperity) and how heavily the party distorts the meaning of language (“whole-process democracy” “genuine democracy”) I wonder whether there’s a point to read much into its choice of words at all<br>

The longer report is crucial to note, available here: <br>Some saying this year's "much shorter" are missing this.<br><br>𝙉𝙋𝘾 𝙊𝙗𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙚𝙧: @gwbstr @cnmediaproject<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/NPC_Observer/status/1581684361207824384?s=20&amp;t=WoK4dXNVcROc9HPlsaFRGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/NPC_Observer/status/1581684361207824384?s=20&amp;t=WoK4dXNVcROc9HPlsaFRGQ</a>

Emphasizing again that this is not what CCP political reports do. They aren't comments on current affairs. These absences expected, not notable.<br><br>Stephen McDonell: Notable for what wasn't in Xi's speech: no mention of soaring youth unemployment; no mention of the property crisis; no mention of economic &amp; social pain from Zero-#Covid in #China. Overall, it was 2 hours heavy on standard rhetoric and light on specific solutions to problems.<br>

And more ridiculous, CCTV commentators immediately said the 2-hour version was shortened. !!!!! So these comments are based on a false premise.<br><br>Matt Schrader: Conclusion: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br>

Re @StephenMcDonell Nothing personal intended — in the very impersonal process of reading CCP congresses. This isn't a spitting contest. . . But any expert on such reports could tell you NOT to expect youth unemployment to be mentioned directly. In fact, it was in the formulaic way of such reports.

Re @StephenMcDonell Here you go: 群众在就业、教育、医疗、<br>托育、养老、住房等方面面临不少难题. "The masses are facing many difficulties on many aspects including employment, education, medical care, childcare, elderly care, housing and so on."

Re @StephenMcDonell "Current affairs" clearly misled you here. . . My point is that the reports generally do not address problems or challenges with urgency or immediacy — but rather with formalistic CCP language. This is known as 提法.

Re @StephenMcDonell The elephants were addressed. I just shared the Chinese with you.

Re @StephenMcDonell Apologies, not sure I follow. My point is simple: political reports are crafted to hint at key problems within existing policies and amplify victories in these areas — but do not generally respond to specific issues. Ex: Russia-Ukr. Some note its absence too. Very predictable.

Re @StephenMcDonell There are obviously limits to teaching time here. But sure, here's just one clear passage on housing. If you're really interested. There is clear mention of housing to live in versus purely speculation: 坚持房子是用来住的、不是用来炒的定位 and more after that.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfNUsbWaYAEJRlJ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re @StephenMcDonell As for the "pandemic impact elephant," the discourse has been crystal and consistent on Xi's resolutely "persisting" in the current policies (even over possible objections within the Party.) Not a surprise to see doubling down, and playing up glory. 抗击疫情人民战争、总体战.

The flood of poor hot takes on Xi Jinping's political report to the 20th National Congress is dumbfounding. As we sift thru the massive, specialized text — half expecting someone to write exultantly that the word "democracy" appears more than 40x, which it (meaninglessly) does.

### 19: [2022-10-17 01:57:41+08:00 推文](https://twitter.com/cnmediaproject/status/1581705958098886656)

Re @StephenMcDonell No, of course, it's not the same thing. But it's exactly how we should expect the political report to address the related field of issues. That's the point. "Notable" is how we began this conversation. If you're expecting elephants, you don't understand pol. reports.

Re @StephenMcDonell I said politely that I was perplexed by it. . . But look, if the BBC wishes to discuss these issues professionally, CMP is happy to oblige — with about 60 combined years of experience on CCP discourse.

Re @StephenMcDonell Is this not just imputing thoughts and motives to others? I'm sorry you feel attacked, but your response just sounds angry and bitter. I'll avoid the bait, thank you. That was a genuine invitation.

Re @nerysinchina Oh, certainly hope not. But certainly wish everyone would slow down just a bit!

### 23: [2022-10-17 02:14:00+08:00 推文](https://twitter.com/cnmediaproject/status/1581710063143903234)

Re @nerysinchina I think that's a totally fair point. And how long, I wonder, will it take us all to walk back the misunderstandings that result?
