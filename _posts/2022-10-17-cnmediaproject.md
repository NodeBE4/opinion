Just a note: political reports generally do not address current affairs concretely. So 3 would be expected. References oblique.<br><br>Kristin Shi-Kupfer: My 3 main impression re: party congress speech read by #XiJinping<br>1.  Heavy ideological (incl. more recent "modernization Chinese style") and "national security" framing<br>2. Points on employment/talent policy (Li Keqiang influence? <br>3. Nothing on Russia &amp; war #china #ccp<br>

Re Example: US not mentioned, but reference to 不怕鬼 could be read as oblique US reference.

Looking for a full-text version of the political report to the 20th CCP Congress? <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/16/the-long-and-short-of-xis-political-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/16/the-long-and-short-of-xis-political-report/</a>

It's all about broad strokes and signals. So yes, those reading it like a blueprint are misguided. Unfortunately, there's a market for insights that aren't there. :)<br><br>Xifan Yang 杨希璠: Given how little the CCP delivers on what it promises (poverty alleviation, common prosperity) and how heavily the party distorts the meaning of language (“whole-process democracy” “genuine democracy”) I wonder whether there’s a point to read much into its choice of words at all<br>

The longer report is crucial to note, available here: <br>Some saying this year's "much shorter" are missing this.<br><br>𝙉𝙋𝘾 𝙊𝙗𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙚𝙧: @gwbstr @cnmediaproject<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/NPC_Observer/status/1581684361207824384?s=20&amp;t=WoK4dXNVcROc9HPlsaFRGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/NPC_Observer/status/1581684361207824384?s=20&amp;t=WoK4dXNVcROc9HPlsaFRGQ</a>

Emphasizing again that this is not what CCP political reports do. They aren't comments on current affairs. These absences expected, not notable.<br><br>Stephen McDonell: Notable for what wasn't in Xi's speech: no mention of soaring youth unemployment; no mention of the property crisis; no mention of economic &amp; social pain from Zero-#Covid in #China. Overall, it was 2 hours heavy on standard rhetoric and light on specific solutions to problems.<br>

And more ridiculous, CCTV commentators immediately said the 2-hour version was shortened. !!!!! So these comments are based on a false premise.<br><br>Matt Schrader: Conclusion: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br>
