Re @StephenMcDonell Nothing personal intended — in the very impersonal process of reading CCP congresses. This isn't a spitting contest. . . But any expert on such reports could tell you NOT to expect youth unemployment to be mentioned directly. In fact, it was in the formulaic way of such reports.

Re @StephenMcDonell "Current affairs" clearly misled you here. . . My point is that the reports generally do not address problems or challenges with urgency or immediacy — but rather with formalistic CCP language. This is known as 提法.

Re @StephenMcDonell Apologies, not sure I follow. My point is simple: political reports are crafted to hint at key problems within existing policies and amplify victories in these areas — but do not generally respond to specific issues. Ex: Russia-Ukr. Some note its absence too. Very predictable.

Re @StephenMcDonell As for the "pandemic impact elephant," the discourse has been crystal and consistent on Xi's resolutely "persisting" in the current policies (even over possible objections within the Party.) Not a surprise to see doubling down, and playing up glory. 抗击疫情人民战争、总体战.

The flood of poor hot takes on Xi Jinping's political report to the 20th National Congress is dumbfounding. As we sift thru the massive, specialized text — half expecting someone to write exultantly that the word "democracy" appears more than 40x, which it (meaninglessly) does.

Re @StephenMcDonell No, of course, it's not the same thing. But it's exactly how we should expect the political report to address the related field of issues. That's the point. "Notable" is how we began this conversation. If you're expecting elephants, you don't understand pol. reports.

CMP has been observing not 安全 alone, a word fragment, but the full term "national security" (国家安全). The rise over three CCP congresses is pronounced. 2012: 4. 2017: 17. 2022: 27.

Re @hcsteinhardt Yes, this is visible in the Xi era, and in the report as well, though comparison and context is necessary. There is "cultural security" (文化安全), "[political] system security" (制度安全), "ideological security" (意识形态安全), and so on.

Totally fascinating for report-crunching junkies. Although, perhaps an obvious point, it can often be far more helpful to put words back into their formulas, or 提法.

Re . . . which would put it in an entirely different category to talk of science policy or science talent and so on. Actually, Hu's banner appears just once. But I use this simply to make the point. “Democracy" is the perfect case in point. Pulling it out is hugely misleading. 2/2

Yes, this is a very crucial point. This section on the state of affairs in 2012 is damning in laying the base for the glorious change of the "New Era."<br><br>Henry Gao: Anyone who believes in the sickness theory should go back and re-read the 20th Party Congress Report: Why else would Xi devote 1.5 pages to what went wrong with the Party,  government, economy, society, national security etc when he took office in 2012?<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysgao/status/1583693199117193217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/henrysgao/status/1583693199117193217</a>

"The enormity of the task is what makes it great and infinitely glorious." Make no mistake, we are entering a new era of fatuousness (with peril just behind) within a "New Era" for the CCP. This language cannot even lose its edges in translation without leaving a vacuum.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfugtEXaAAEId8A?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Xi emphasizes "self-governance." But as we mentioned in a thread recently, the key phrase "intra-Party democracy," with a long history in the CCP, was dropped this year for the first time in more than four decades.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfuiSbtaYAAT1sK?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Xi Jinping finishes by enjoining journalists to offer an "unbiased" view of China, and the "story of the Chinese Communist Party." The entry on "Journalism" in our partner project Decoding China will be up soon. Here is "freedom of speech." <a href="https://decodingchina.eu/freedom-of-speech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://decodingchina.eu/freedom-of-speech/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfujyyAakAA_5f0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re @thinking_panda That's exactly right: We're in the "New Era" of "whole-process democracy."

The eagerly-awaited lineup of Politburo Standing Committee members is now a done deal. You have time to read our latest on the shiny new 20th Congress buzzword: "Five Firm Grasps" (五个牢牢把握). <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/23/five-firm-grasps-for-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/23/five-firm-grasps-for-the-world/</a>

Watching Xi's new standing committee line up today, and reflecting on changes globally in the past 10 years, it is impossible not to consider that the entire world has forgotten its history lessons.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfusTA8aUAA3IRI?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re @dravirmani That sounds frightfully familiar. Closely following CCP discourse and its history over two decades, the oft-heard dismissive labels include "tea-leaf reading" and "Kremlinology."
