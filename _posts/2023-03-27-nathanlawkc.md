It's kinda sad to see all the hype around this man.<br>Let me remind all of you: he's part of the Chinese Communist Party.<br>Supporting him is no different from supporting those artists championing Erdoğan, Lukashenko or even Putin.<br>He's against our values. https://t.co/8bgpQxEF45<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fsa3dptXoAAaZ2u?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
