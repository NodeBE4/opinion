### 92: [An Unauthorized War: The Shaky Legal Ground for the U.S. Operation in Syria](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/s1gfcl/an_unauthorized_war_the_shaky_legal_ground_for/), submitted on 2022-01-12 00:07:46+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Brian Finucane, Senior Adviser in the U.S. Program at the International Crisis Group\]

"The legal contortions the U.S. government has taken in Syria should not be allowed to become a precedent. In order to keep this from happening, it is important to acknowledge the myriad ways in which the U.S. government has stretched its current authority and consider how a reinvigorated framework for congressional engagement might avoid seeing future administrations take similar liberties in similar scenarios."

"We studied strike data from Pakistan, where the Pentagon and the CIA reportedly conducted nearly 400 strikes in the ten-year period before President Barack Obama’s administration tightened its targeting requirements. In 2013, the administration officially shifted its standard from “reasonable certainty” of zero civilian casualties to “near certainty.” Our analysis shows that this policy change dramatically reduced civilian casualties in Pakistan without giving terrorists an appreciable advantage, suggesting that similarly stringent targeting standards might save innocent lives in theaters such as Iraq and Syria, too."

### 95: [The Nonproliferation Regime Is Breaking: Fixing It Will Require Tougher, Smarter Inspections](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/s2zatm/the_nonproliferation_regime_is_breaking_fixing_it/), submitted on 2022-01-13 21:20:43+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Toby Dalton, Co-Director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Ariel (Eli) Levite, Senior Fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program and Cyber Policy Initiative at the Carnegie Endowment.\]

"To restore the nonproliferation regime’s role as a bulwark of global stability, international nonproliferation institutions and states need new ways to track and tackle the development of nuclear weapons. This requires an innovative approach to monitoring and constraining dangerous activity. But given that more countries are acquiring or producing highly enriched uranium, material constraints alone are not enough. Monitors will need fresh tools to credibly track additional indicators of potential bomb activity that are hard to pass off as peaceful in nature, such as weaponization: the development and manufacture of nuclear warheads for missiles or other delivery vehicles. Monitoring this kind of activity, in particular, goes beyond the traditional focus of nuclear observers, but it may now offer the best, most reliable way to know whether states are trying to acquire nuclear weapons."

### 96: [Washington’s Missing China Strategy: To Counter Beijing, the Biden Administration Needs to Decide What It Wants](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/s3vriu/washingtons_missing_china_strategy_to_counter/), submitted on 2022-01-15 00:01:36+08:00.

----- __96.1__ -----2022-01-15 00:03:00+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security\]

"To invoke the U.S.-Chinese rivalry as a defining feature of today’s world is now commonplace, and analysts and policymakers across the political spectrum support the United States’ shift away from engagement and toward competition. Jettisoning Washington’s previous strategy of cooperation and integration, premised as it was on the eventual transformation of Chinese behavior, is a rare point of agreement between the Trump and Biden administrations.

That is a welcome shift, given the paucity of positive results yielded by the previous approach. China and the United States are in a largely competitive relationship, and U.S. policy aims to respond to Chinese actions more than to shape them. A strategy grounded in this reality—one that combines a U.S.-led coalition with targeted, issue-specific efforts to contest Chinese assertiveness—is now emerging to protect U.S. interests and values.

There is, however, a glaring omission in the new policy: an objective."

### 97: [The Green Deal Could Make—or Break—the European Project: The EU Must Not Let Populists and Nationalists Derail the Plan](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/s3vuoi/the_green_deal_could_makeor_breakthe_european/), submitted on 2022-01-15 00:05:07+08:00.

----- __97.1__ -----2022-01-15 00:06:18+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Nathalie Toccci, Director of the Istituto Affari Internazionali in Rome\]

"Skeptics were poised to add the European Green Deal to that long list of failures when it was first unveiled in mid-December 2019.  As the signature initiative of the European Commission under President Ursula von der Leyen, the deal aims to make Europe carbon-neutral by 2050, comprehensively overhauling nearly every sector of the continent’s economy in the process. Although there was good reason to predict that such an ambitious agenda might provoke division and controversy in a union already struggling to find its footing, the deal appears to have infused the European project with a new sense of unity and hope. The push for carbon neutrality has traditionally been viewed with greater skepticism in southern Europe and especially in eastern Europe, but the inclusion of fiscal transfer mechanisms to aid weaker economies through the transition has helped mitigate opposition."
