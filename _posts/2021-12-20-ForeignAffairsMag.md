“…The nature of the contemporary liberal international order leaves democracies particularly vulnerable to both internal and external illiberal pressures.  
In their current form, liberal institutions cannot stem the rising illiberal tide; governments have struggled to prevent the diffusion of antidemocratic ideologies and tactics, both homegrown and imported. Liberal democracies must adapt to fend off threats on multiple levels. But there is a catch. Any attempt to grapple with this crisis will require policy decisions that are clearly illiberal or necessitate a new version of liberal order.”

### 70: [China’s Soft-Power Advantage in Africa: Beijing Isn’t Just Building Roads—It’s Making Friends](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rnnr1l/chinas_softpower_advantage_in_africa_beijing_isnt/), submitted on 2021-12-24 22:47:38+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Lina Benabdallah, Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Wake Forest University\]  
“China’s evolving presence in Africa, including the BRI, is based as much on investment in building social and human capital as it is on giant infrastructure projects. Since the beginning of this century, Beijing has invested heavily in cultivating political, educational, and institutional relationships with leaders and citizens in almost all African countries with which it has diplomatic relations. As similar opportunities for Africans with Western states have declined, China has stepped into the breach.  
To its own detriment, Washington has failed to fully reckon with these less visible elements of Beijing’s diplomacy. If the administration of President Joe Biden is serious about countering Chinese influence across the developing world, it would do well to understand how China’s policies actually work and the benefits that the country stands to gain from its efforts in Africa—and across the globe.”

### 71: [The Art of War: Can Culture Drive Geopolitics?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/rnnutv/the_art_of_war_can_culture_drive_geopolitics/), submitted on 2021-12-24 22:53:39+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Beverly Gage, Professor of U.S. History and American Studies at Yale University\]  
“Despite its impressionistic style, Menand’s book speaks powerfully to one of the most important themes in twentieth-century U.S. politics: the ways in which the Cold War—and the specter of communism—reshaped American society from top to bottom. As historians such as Mary Dudziak and Glenda Gilmore have shown, the struggle for postwar civil rights was tied to debates over communism and Third World revolution. The U.S. welfare state, too, was developed with socialist models as inescapable points of reference. It has long been obvious that anticommunist sentiment constrained liberal policy ambitions in the 1940s and 1950s, when universal health care was derided as “socialized medicine” and champions of labor rights were inevitably accused of harboring communist sympathies. In less obvious ways, however, the Cold War drove the United States in more progressive policy directions: as a struggle against a society that claimed to stand for cradle-to-grave economic security, the Cold War pushed the United States to present itself as a model nation, supposedly able to provide its citizens with the best quality of life in the world.”
