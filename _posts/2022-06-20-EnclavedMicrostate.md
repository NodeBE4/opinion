At first I worried it'd be slightly esoteric, but nope, not quite! The 'Made in Hong Kong' was a helpful early giveaway.

Stamp 1: 油麻地 Yau Ma Tei, a residential area in Kowloon

Stamp 2: 上海街 Shanghai Street

Stamp 3: 三壹[六] 3 1 6

Stamp 4: 陳枝記 Chan Chi Kee

Stamp 5: 銳利 sharp

Stamp 6: 電話 Phone [number]

To put it simply, this is the address and phone number of the Chan Chi Kee Cutlery Company, plus a stamp guaranteeing sharpness.
