At first I worried it'd be slightly esoteric, but nope, not quite! The 'Made in Hong Kong' was a helpful early giveaway.

Stamp 1: 油麻地 Yau Ma Tei, a residential area in Kowloon

Stamp 2: 上海街 Shanghai Street

Stamp 3: 三壹[六] 3 1 6

Stamp 4: 陳枝記 Chan Chi Kee

Stamp 5: 銳利 sharp

Stamp 6: 電話 Phone [number]

To put it simply, this is the address and phone number of the Chan Chi Kee Cutlery Company, plus a stamp guaranteeing sharpness.

No idea; there’s nothing obvious to suggest it and the shop is still around at that address, so it can’t be dated by that.

Recorded content means either being or hiring an editor, and as someone who edits podcasts (i.e. *just* audio) as an amateur, boy is editing time-consuming. On top of that, depending on what kind of content you're making, edited videos may not offer that much of an advantage and in fact even have drawbacks. Gameplay for instance is more conducive to interaction with an audience.

Not necessarily. I had a look at the 5 mid-sized EN agencies back when there were still 5 mid-sized agencies and Tsunderia and Cyberlive hadn't yet reorganised, and only Tsunderia and Phase-Connect had any members (and even then, only two each) who had previously been either independent or at another agency. VShojo being majority ex-indie is relatively unusual for a larger EN agency.

### 551: [Why didn't Russia gain any colonies in Africa or East Asia?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vh4swk/why_didnt_russia_gain_any_colonies_in_africa_or/), submitted on 2022-06-21 12:33:20+08:00.

----- __551.1__ -----2022-06-21 17:05:57+08:00:

The premises of this question are half-right. Russia isn't normally my specialism although I happen to be read up on a few relevant areas so I'll give this question the best stab I can.

###Africa

There was actually an attempt by Cossack adventurers to establish a Russian presence in or near Ethiopia, ostensibly to assist the 'Orthodox' Ethiopian Empire against British and Italian predations. In January 1889, Nikolai Ivanovich Ashinov led a band of just over 160 men, women, and children in seizing the fortified village of Sagallo on the coast of Djibouti, which was rather ostentatiously renamed New Moscow. Ashinov had been a wanted criminal in Russia and his involvement in the region was never formally sanctioned by the Russian government (though it received considerable support from several officials acting on personal initiative), which latterly disavowed any connection with his expedition, and within less than a month of its establishment the Cossack colony was assaulted and dispersed by the French navy.

The Russian government's relative disinterest in the African continent was, all told, quite comprehensible. For one, most of its geopolitical interests simply lay elsewhere, but for another, the logistics of trying to establish an African empire from Russia would have been quite problematic. Now, it's not as though the Russian Empire had no maritime presence, as it did after all have four coastlines: the Arctic, the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Pacific. But to get to Africa from any of these would have been a bit of a problem. 

* The Arctic is pretty obvious. 

* Getting out from the Baltic would have meant sailing through the Danish Straits and/or the Kiel Canal, and then either the North Sea or the English Channel. That meant that Russia would have to be on at least terms with Britain and also either Denmark or Prussia/Germany to sustain a maritime link between Africa and its Baltic ports such as St Petersburg and Riga. Moreover, Russia's naval power in the Baltic had been curtailed by the 1856 Treaty of Paris at the end of the Crimean War, which demilitarised the Åland Islands.

* Getting out from the Black Sea meant sailing through the Bosporus and Dardanelles, i.e. past the Ottomans, whose territorial integrity had also been guaranteed by Britain and France. Moreover, the Treaty of Paris had mandated the demilitarisation of the Black Sea and Russia would not begin rebuilding its naval presence there until after the conclusion of the 1877-8 Russo-Turkish War, and even with that remilitarisation Russia was still bound by the 1841 London Straits Convention which prohibited the movement of non-Ottoman warships through the Turkish Straits. Even if you could send a civilian ship out via the Straits, its options out of the Mediterranean were either via the Strait of Gibraltar (which meant sailing past Italian, French, and British territory) or the Suez Canal (owned originally by France and latterly by Britain). So, as with the Baltic, you had to be on decently friendly terms with a number of major, potentially rival powers to keep your sea lanes open.

* The Pacific at least was a decently plausible option, but there were some obvious limitations. Russia did not have a blue-water port until the establishment of Vladivostok in 1860, with previous bases such as Petropavlovsk and Nikolaevsk being white-water (that is, they were iced in for several months of the year). White-water ports, simply put, are substantially limited by those climactic conditions. But while the Russians did eventually gain year-round maritime access to the Pacific thanks to Vladivostok, the extent to which goods and people could be moved to and from the region from European Russia was, for a good while, quite limited, thanks to the absence of a railway. The Trans-Siberian Railway, which would eventually provide that link, would not even begin construction until 1891, and would only be complete by 1904.

In effect, even if Russia did have ambitions in Africa, there was simply no practicable way of realising them from a simple logistical standpoint. But also, and I would argue this may be more important: why go overseas for empire when you could just look out over your land borders?

###East Asia

To put it bluntly, Russian expansion in East Asia most certainly did happen, especially if we include Manchuria in that definition. Russia exploited Qing weakness during the Arrow War (1856-60) against Britain and France, itself a result of Qing military weakness resulting from the ongoing Taiping War (1851-64) against domestic rebels, to expand its territory in Siberia to regions that had been officially within Qing borders since the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689. The Nerchinsk treaty had affirmed Qing control of the entire Amur watershed, although actual Manchu rule in the region was relatively weak if it was apparent at all beyond a series of border markers – indeed, Nikolaevsk would be founded in Qing territory in 1850. The 1858 Treaty of Aigun, which preceded the signing of the Treaty of Tientsin with Britain and France, saw the Russians gain control of all formerly Qing territory north of the Amur, and the subsequent Convention of Peking also saw Russia gain control of the land east of the Ussuri, with an additional border drawn south of Lake Khanka, giving Russia a small border with the Korean Joseon kingdom as well as its long-desired blue-water port at Vladivostok, formerly the Manchu town of Haišenwai.

While Russian territorial control lay mostly beyond the Amur and Ussuri, there was an expansion of Russian influence in the Manchurian interior as well, especially in the wake of the establishment of a naval base at Port Arthur in 1898 (on which [more in this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/d4qf6n/what_leverage_did_the_british_have_in_getting_the/f0hrjzd/)). Russia's position in the region would be leveraged following the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-5, when it issued a diplomatic protest to Japan along with France and Germany in what was known as the 'Triple Intervention' to limit Japanese gains, and it would also gain a hand in Korea thanks to the Russian embassy becoming a refuge for King Gojong from both pro-Qing and pro-Japanese factions. Gojong's declaration of the Korean Empire in 1897 (on which [more in this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l8q6jd/korea_changed_their_official_name_to_taehan/glgr874/)) was undertaken on the implicit understanding of Russian support. And, in 1900, it would be Russia that dispatched the largest intervention force during the Boxer Uprising, launching a major invasion of Manchuria with around 100,000 troops, only a portion of which were withdrawn following the signing of the Boxer Protocol. In the wake of this, an extension of the Trans-Siberian Railway, known as the Chinese Eastern Railroad, would be established across Manchuria in 1903 as a shortcut to the Trans-Siberian route that followed the Russio-Qing border, and garrisoned by the Russian forces left over after the 1900 intervention.

Russia's long-term interests in the Pacific would be somewhat curtailed thanks to its utter defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, but although Russia lost its lease on Port Arthur, its Manchurian railway concessions, and its protectorship over Korea, it did still retain the main part of its Pacific coastline, which, when the Russian Empire became the Soviet Union, served critical strategic purposes in both the Second World War and the Cold War. The existence of Russian imperial territory in East Asia isn't just a 'was', it's an 'is'. The bulk of those imperial holdings still exist as part of the modern-day Russian Federation.

###Other Imperial Expansions

I think it's worth adding a little coda here by pointing out that we tend to conceive of imperialism as a maritime endeavour when it really isn't. Imperialism is about control of *land*, and the fact that our colloquial images of colonial and imperial powers happen to be ones whose land holdings were separated by water is arguably just coincidence. Russia's imperial expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century was considerable, and extended across multiple regions. The most territorially substantial was its conquest of Central Asia from the 1850s to the 1880s, but there were also considerable operations against the Ottoman Empire and Iran. These conquests saw Russia extend its control over Dagestan, Chechnya, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, just to name the most substantial of the Caucasian polities, and Russia would also force the Ottoman Empire to cede independence to Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria. That Russia's expansion was over contiguous landmass doesn't make it any less of an imperial power, and ultimately the aims and modes of that imperialism were entirely analogous to those of other imperial powers: presumptions of racial and/or civilisational superiority mixed with pragmatic desires for natural resources and strategic territory.

----- __556.1__ -----2022-06-22 18:04:13+08:00:

So a few notes because the Twitter account for the project doesn't seem to have included as much detail as some past promotions:

### Ocean Park MTR station lightboxes (Reflect)

These are **inside the paid area of the station**, so you can get off the train, have a look/take photos, and get on another train without having to pay the fare for getting off at Ocean Park.

### Tsing Yi MTR station lightbox (Victoria Harbour scene)

This is **outside** the paid area, near exit 1A, so you will have to pay the fare for getting off at Tsing Yi Station.

### The Bus

So, the actual bus is on **Route 11D** from Lok Fu to Kwun Tong Ferry Pier, *not* Route 1A as per the promotional images. The trip between the two lasts around 35 minutes depending on traffic and buses depart every 20 minutes, so as a general rule the bus will depart one terminus either 40 or 60 minutes after it departed the previous one, depending on if there's another bus to serve as a buffer. The AcrossBus tracker is entirely volunteer-run, so you may have to do some estimating based on the last known location. Also, because both terminuses are basically also on the same MTR line you might be able to outrun the bus by taking a train if you miss it at either one, but uh, don't quote me on that – bear in mind that Kwun Tong Ferry Pier is about 1km from the station, so uh, walk fast.

## My Route Plan

[Map](https://imgur.com/ssZ49G0)

I needed to be on Ap Lei Chau this morning so that was fortunate in that it meant I'd pass through Ocean Park station anyway. From there I went to Tsing Yi by MTR, got out to take a snap of the lightbox there, then took the MTR to Lok Fu and got on the Goombus to Kwun Tong Ferry Pier and made my way home from there. For a more detailed breakdown, it went:

1. South Horizons –[South Island Line]–> Ocean Park (Reflect lightboxes)

1. Ocean Park –[South Island Line]–> Admiralty

1. Admiralty –[Tsuen Wan Line]–> Central/Hong Kong

1. Central/Hong Kong –[Tung Chung Line]–> Tsing Yi (Victoria Harbour lightbox)

1. Tsing Yi –[Tung Chung Line]–> Lai King

1. Lai King –[Tsuen Wan Line]–> Prince Edward

1. Prince Edward –[Kwun Tong Line]–> Lok Fu

1. Lok Fu –[11D]–> Kwun Tong Ferry Pier

In terms of fares overall, it was $14.3 to get from South Horizons to Tsing Yi, $8.3 to get from Tsing Yi to Lok Fu, and $5.4 to ride the 11D, for a neat $28 overall (excluding other transport fees like getting to Ap Lei Chau from home and back home from Kwun Tong.

## Thought Experiment: The Most Efficient Route Plan

Given that you *have* to get out at Tsing Yi but not at Ocean Park, probably the most cost-efficient route (excluding costs of getting to the start and end stations) would be to go from Tsing Yi to Lok Fu or vice versa but detouring to Ocean Park (taking the bus being optional), which compresses it all to a single trip where you just have to pay the $8.3 Tsing Yi<–>Lok Fu fare.

So, assuming that you are able to catch the bus from Kwun Tong Ferry Pier to Lok Fu at the start, the best route for the MTR leg would be:

1. Lok Fu –[Kwun Tong Line]–> Kowloon Tong

1. Kowloon Tong –[East Rail Line]–> Admiralty

1. Admiralty –[South Island Line]–> Ocean Park

1. Ocean Park –[South Island Line]–> Admiralty

1. Admiralty –[Tsuen Wan Line]–> Lai King

1. Lai King –[Tung Chung Line]–> Tsing Yi

Or vice versa, if you think you can time it just right to get on the bus at Lok Fu.

### 559: [what historical/geographical/demographic reasons are there for why most unifications of china came from dynasties that started north of the yangtze vs south of the yangtze?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vicn8q/what_historicalgeographicaldemographic_reasons/), submitted on 2022-06-23 03:01:04+08:00.

----- __559.1__ -----2022-06-23 17:00:18+08:00:

Thanks to /u/10thousand_stars for writing a very broad-ranging answer (I was contemplating doing one myself but my expertise simply doesn't range that far). I do, however, want to raise a bit of an issue with the question's discussion of northern 'barbarian' polities.

To put it quite bluntly, the Mongols were the only nomadic people that successfully conquered all of China proper, and only did so thanks to an incredible amount of deliberate effort and diplomatic manoeuvring. The rivers running West-East through China, most prominently the Yangtze, were quite substantial obstacles to the Mongols, and would be circumvented through invading the indigenous kingdom of Dali in what is now Yunnan via Tibet and the more fordable upper reaches of the Yangtze in Sichuan. Even then, it took over 25 years after the subjugation of the Dali kingdom for the Mongols to overrun the territory of Southern Song. In other words the Mongol conquest in this region was made possibly only by creating an entirely new invasion route from scratch, on the part of a power with substantial enough control over neighbouring regions to be able to do so.

Earlier regimes of nomadic origin were generally unsuccessful in penetrating outside of northern China, as southern states were generally successful at maintaining stalemate lines on major rivers. For instance, northern Wei, which existed roughly from the late fourth to early sixth centuries CE, halted at the Yangtze; the Jurchen Jin state, which existed from the early twelfth century until its conquest by the Mongols over the course of 1211-34, extended only as far as the Huai. No nomadic polity before the Mongols established any sustained dominion of a region south of the Huai, let alone the Yangtze, and no nomadic polity would establish substantial control over any part of China proper again. The Manchus, it is worth noting, were *not* nomadic, outside of the northernmost portions of Jurchen-speakers known to the Ming as *Yeren* ('wild people'). The vast majority of the Jurchen people that became the Manchus were sedentary agriculturalists, with the patriarchs of free Jurchen households also involved in communal hunts to supplement agrarian food sources (in addition to fishing and sedentary herding where these were possible). While the Manchus and Mongols had a number of cultural similarities, societally speaking they were quite distinct.

All this to say that there is a tendency for discussions of the relationship between China and the nomadic world to fall into two opposite extremes: on the one hand there's the 'Sinicisation' model that asserts that nomadic influence was invariably ephemeral and that Chinese culture simply overwhelmed that of nomadic societies, and on the other there's the sort of hot take meme that nomads overran imperial China on a regular basis. The answer really lies somewhere in between: *northern* China was historically quite tied into the nomadic world, whereas southern China was not.

### 560: [Few Chinese caravans/travelling traders made in through the Parthian Empire, so how would that be done? Did they sell everything they had at the nearest Parthian city and the Parthians would later sell it themselves?

While I suspect more could be said on the specific dynamics of trade in the era of the Arsacids, as I note in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jsb5my/whats_the_state_of_scholarship_on_the_silk_road/gbyl2uc/) the entire popular conception of the 'Silk Road' is wrong. Throughout history, Chinese caravans rarely ventured beyond the Tarim Basin, let alone as far as Iran, not necessarily because they were physically or legally prevented from doing so but because making a greater number of shorter trips was more profitable and less risky than making a few long ones. Individuals and even some wares could and did travel great distances at times, but in general, the movement of goods and ideas across the Eurasian continent before direct maritime links were forged in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was an emergent property of a large number of local and regional exchanges, and almost never due to people making an entire journey from Europe to Asia or vice versa. That is not to say that there were never instances of such travels, but these were principally by diplomats, priests, and statesmen and women, as well as the occasional enterprising traveller.

Hi there - we're happy to approve your question related to your creative project, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists and the like, based on past experience: some people working on creative projects have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what's needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it's not always what you want to hear. 

Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you're asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don't know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.

For more general advice about doing research to inform a creative project, please check out [our Monday Methods post on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k8o4rv/monday_methods_researching_for_fiction/).
