\[SS from the article by Michael Beckley, Associate Professor of Political Science at Tufts University\]

"The United States and its allies share a common aspiration for an international order based on democratic principles and enshrined in international agreements and laws. The core of such an order is being forged in the crucible of competition with China and could be built out into the most enlightened order the world has ever seen—a genuine free world. But to get there, the United States and its allies will have to embrace competition with China and march forward together through another long twilight struggle."

### 123: [To Reveal, Or Not to Reveal: The Calculus Behind U.S. Intelligence Disclosures](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/st64d4/to_reveal_or_not_to_reveal_the_calculus_behind_us/), submitted on 2022-02-15 23:57:16+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Douglas London, Senior Operations Officer in the CIA Clandestine Service for over 34 years\]

"In the case of the crisis in Ukraine, so far, it appears as if the United States is using the intelligence it has gathered to maximum effect. At long last, Washington is catching up to its rivals—including Russia and Wikileaks—in the use of information to shape events. The true gauge of the strategy’s efficacy, of course, will be whether or not Russia actually invades." Read Douglas London on the benefits and risks of disclosing U.S. intelligence.

Read Eric Merkley, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto, on the implications of recent protests in Ottawa, and accross Canada. 

"If the Conservative Party does embrace right-wing populism, it would be a departure from its traditional moderation—one with troubling consequences for Canadian democracy. "

### 125: [Russia Has Big Plans for Africa: America Must Push Back—Without Getting Dragged In](https://old.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/sup7le/russia_has_big_plans_for_africa_america_must_push/), submitted on 2022-02-17 21:47:42+08:00.

----- __125.1__ -----2022-02-17 21:48:29+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Samuel Ramani, Tutor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford\]

"Russia’s indiscriminate arms sales fuel conflict, its shadowy commercial deals empower kleptocracy, and its autocratic bent undermines democracy. Nor is the flurry of activity good news for the United States and its allies, which are seeing their soft power in Africa dissipate. To counter the Kremlin’s influence, then, the West needs to turn its attention to the continent once more—without turning Africa into an arena for great-power competition."

### 126: [Russia's Cyber Tactics in a Potential Ukraine Invasion](https://old.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/suu7d6/russias_cyber_tactics_in_a_potential_ukraine/), submitted on 2022-02-18 01:26:31+08:00.

### 127: [Africa's Fossil-Fuel Trap](https://old.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/svipzm/africas_fossilfuel_trap/), submitted on 2022-02-18 22:03:30+08:00.

----- __127.1__ -----2022-02-18 22:04:35+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Nnimmo Bassey, Director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation, and Anabela Lemos, Director and a founding member of Justiça Ambiental\]

"By continuing to finance gas expansion in Africa, outside investors are in fact displacing renewables, delaying Africa’s energy transition, and making it harder for countries to decarbonize and escape a harmful extractive economic model. Investments in renewable energy would produce an economic model that is cheaper, more reliable, and more democratic. Africa need not be seen as a site of destitution and need. It is a continent with rich knowledge, practices, and potential for establishing ecologically sound socioeconomic systems—ones that don’t replicate the mistakes made by so many others in the past century."
