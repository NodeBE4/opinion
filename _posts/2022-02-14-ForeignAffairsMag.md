\[SS from the article by Michael Beckley, Associate Professor of Political Science at Tufts University\]

"The United States and its allies share a common aspiration for an international order based on democratic principles and enshrined in international agreements and laws. The core of such an order is being forged in the crucible of competition with China and could be built out into the most enlightened order the world has ever seen—a genuine free world. But to get there, the United States and its allies will have to embrace competition with China and march forward together through another long twilight struggle."

\[SS from the article by Douglas London, Senior Operations Officer in the CIA Clandestine Service for over 34 years\]

"In the case of the crisis in Ukraine, so far, it appears as if the United States is using the intelligence it has gathered to maximum effect. At long last, Washington is catching up to its rivals—including Russia and Wikileaks—in the use of information to shape events. The true gauge of the strategy’s efficacy, of course, will be whether or not Russia actually invades." Read Douglas London on the benefits and risks of disclosing U.S. intelligence.
