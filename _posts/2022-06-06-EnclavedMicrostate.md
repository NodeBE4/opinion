One day we will discover that it is in fact Fauna who is flipped Anuaf, and not the other way around.

----- __507.2__ -----2022-06-06 15:04:42+08:00:

So if Fauna is flipped Enuaf then is Anuaf flipped Faune?

*irked linguist noises*

----- __509.2__ -----2022-06-07 15:11:07+08:00:

There isn't a single Chinese language, but rather a variety of languages with a common ancestor grouped under the Sinitic label. Mandarin, which is the basis of Standard Chinese and which is the most widely-spoken Chinese language on both sides of the Taiwan strait, is only one of these. I for one speak Cantonese natively, which is a language within the Yue subgroup that is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin.

----- __509.3__ -----2022-06-07 21:16:25+08:00:

Yes, by convention, but it's a bad convention and I'd like to influence people to change it. As a speaker of a minority Sinitic language, at a time when China itself has for decades cracked down on such languages, I may just have a certain justifiable annoyance at people treating Mandarin-derived Standard Chinese as *the* Chinese language.

Demae Iccho is manna from heaven. I will not be taking further enquiries at this time.

----- __509.5__ -----2022-06-08 18:45:16+08:00:

It'll depend on your definition, because given things like the recent controversy over Luxiem's merch vis-a-vis other EN units as well as ex-KR and ID livers, it seems like there's a decent chunk of people who don't see Niji as treating its talents equitably.

----- __509.6__ -----2022-06-08 18:46:56+08:00:

Those two also caught my notice. Firstly, 20% annual growth does not sound sustainable.

Secondly, I'm getting the distinct impression that Anycolor's approach is to disincentivise smaller talents leaving (given the comments about IP ownership and viability outside the company), and incentivise bigger talents staying. And I mean that works from a corporate perspective, but the word 'sustainability' continues to gnaw at the back of my mind here: how long can they keep it up? 

EDIT: For another, at what point does it become the case that Niji either can't keep their big talents from seeking greener pastures because the agency isn't providing as much support as those talents might be able to arrange for themselves for less, or can't keep their small talents because they aren't getting the same incentives?

### 510: [What was the reaction of the pope and other important Christian figures of the time to the Taiping Rebellion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v6ffvk/what_was_the_reaction_of_the_pope_and_other/), submitted on 2022-06-07 06:25:35+08:00.

----- __510.1__ -----2022-06-07 12:50:51+08:00:

This is one of those times where the most relevant answer to link is not one of my own, but rather one of /u/keyilan's on an older version of a similar question: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6qdmvz/how_did_the_pope_respond_to_hong_xiuquan_claiming/

Our ability to discuss reception of the Taiping by various overseas faith leaders is limited by a lack of available published research, at least in English. Whether this is due to an absence of evidence or an absence of interest is an open question, and it may be that some years down the line we *will* know the opinions on the Taiping held by Pope Pius IX, or Saint Philaret of Moscow, or Archbishop John Bird Sumner of Canterbury. As it stands, however, that information is not readily accessible. We *do* have a lot of published opinions by missionaries of numerous denominations within China, and there has been considerable analysis thereof, both of which I discuss in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mtzo7d/what_were_some_reactions_from_the_european/gv3gv3n/). But as for leading lights back in Europe? Nothing as yet.

### 511: [What happened to the ethnic Taiwanese after the Republic of China officials escaped mainland China and established a government in Taiwan?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v6r0rt/what_happened_to_the_ethnic_taiwanese_after_the/), submitted on 2022-06-07 17:25:25+08:00.

----- __511.1__ -----2022-06-08 12:05:13+08:00:

In effect, yes. I'm not familiar enough with modern (i.e. post-1895) Taiwanese identity discourse to comment on the use of *benshengren* vs *waishengren* and the place of indigenous Taiwanese within the former category so I'll operate in largely Qing terms here:

Taiwan's indigenous Austronesian peoples had been largely undisturbed by external settlement until the mid-16th century, when the increasing commercial significance of the seas around Taiwan drew in permanent Dutch and Spanish colonisation in the southern and northern parts of the island, respectively, as well as temporary presences by smugglers, pirates, and more legitimate merchants from Japan and the Chinese mainland. The Dutch in particular deliberately encouraged Chinese migration in order to get workers for their sugar and rice plantations, which effectively marked the beginning of Han Chinese settlement on the island. When the Dutch were expelled from southern Taiwan in 1661-2 by Ming loyalists under Koxinga, these would be joined by these anti-Qing forces.

While the Qing initially expelled many of the old Ming loyalists from Taiwan, leaving a small rump permanent population, the perceived economic benefits of maintaining a settler presence were sufficient to convince authorities to agree to allow quite substantial populations of seasonal workers who would travel to Taiwan during the planting and harvest seasons and return to mainland China during the winter. This in time morphed into the 'seasonal' workers settling in Taiwan permanently and petitioning – often successfully – to have their families brought over. This was accompanied by both displacement and forcible assimilation of the indigenous peoples of the coastal plains where Qing settlers, er, settled. By 1780 it was estimated there were 800,000 Han compared to 40,000 indigenous people in the plains.

The Qing did not, however, exercise or intend to exercise meaningful control over the Taiwanese highlands until the 1870s, when diplomatic pressure legitimised calls for the state to expand its influence into those regions and also open them up for Han settlement. An aggressive programme of colonisation followed, with Han settlements strategically placed to break up tribal lands, woods cleared for roads and plantations, punitive expeditions against the indigenous tribes, and a deliberate programme of Confucianising education introduced. This would be interrupted by the Japanese annexation of Taiwan in 1895, at which point my understanding of the island's ethnic relations ceases.

Framing this as settler-colonialism isn't new, although it has, for obvious reasons of lack of popular interest, not really made it outside academic discourse. If you're interested in going deeper though, Emma Teng's *Taiwan's Imagined Geography* is the thing to read.

----- __511.2__ -----2022-06-08 14:42:11+08:00:

Assimilatory policies have meant that the plains indigenous peoples have unfortunately largely been subsumed, although there are still some 14,000 or so people identifying as members of one of the plains tribes (the three principal and locally-recognised ones being the Siraya, Taivoan, and Makatao). The highland tribes have generally remained much more cohesive, and altogether account for a little over 550,000 people. The combined indigenous people of Taiwan currently constitute around 2.4% of the total national population, albeit, as stated, weighted overwhelmingly towards the highland tribes.

### 512: [Opinions on IRyS and her Outfits "Issue"](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/v74fm5/opinions_on_irys_and_her_outfits_issue/), submitted on 2022-06-08 02:53:54+08:00.

----- __512.1__ -----2022-06-08 12:27:17+08:00:

I'd like to throw in an extra factor that doesn't always get brought up: while IRyS happens to live in Japan, the original VSinger requirements *did not* specify that applicants had to live in Japan, only that those who were Japanese-fluent would be preferred. So for all we know, Cover planned around the VSinger not being based in Japan and IRyS being in Japan was pure coincidence. Given how well in advance we know Cover plans some things, it's legitimately possible that the original roadmap didn't involve 3D until well down the line.
