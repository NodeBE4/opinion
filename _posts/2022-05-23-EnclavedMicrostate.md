### 455: [HololiveEN as well as Calli, Gura, Ame, Kronii, and Bae all have TikTok accounts.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/uvrtek/hololiveen_as_well_as_calli_gura_ame_kronii_and/), submitted on 2022-05-23 12:06:29+08:00.

I'd imagine there's a certain difference between approaching it as a corporate entity and approaching it as a private individual. One imagines a tech corporation would be aware of the appropriate security measures to take while still making use of the platform.

### 456: [Is it known for sure why HoloEN hasn’t really done 3D streams or lives outside of Calli?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/uvt9qc/is_it_known_for_sure_why_holoen_hasnt_really_done/), submitted on 2022-05-23 13:41:09+08:00.

No she then came back to Japan. Her situation’s complicated because of rehearsals for the live concert in July.

----- __456.2__ -----2022-05-23 17:24:07+08:00:

Well, the Priichu models + their setup have produced somewhat janky results, and I'd imagine nobody wants the first use of the official models by those members to be plagued by technical issues.

### 457: [The pure sass from both the commenter and mod here is hilarious to me](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uw0zmm/the_pure_sass_from_both_the_commenter_and_mod/), submitted on 2022-05-23 22:05:49+08:00.

----- __457.1__ -----2022-05-24 20:27:02+08:00:

It's not *un*common by any means, though. The study of Chinese history has always had a bit of an identity crisis between being a field of history and a subfield of Chinese cultural studies and it's only relatively recently that there's been a strong pivot to the former.

### 458: [Glorious Golden Glam - Weekly Discussion Thread, May 23rd, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/uw3c3q/glorious_golden_glam_weekly_discussion_thread_may/), submitted on 2022-05-23 23:51:25+08:00.

----- __458.1__ -----2022-05-25 18:16:33+08:00:

This is interesting; HoloJP's generally presumed to have had a 30-35-35 split between Youtube, Cover, and the talent, so Moona saying hers was 30-50-20 seems to be quite a big shift, unless she got the maths wrong since it contradicts what she says earlier in the clip.

----- __458.2__ -----2022-05-25 19:41:52+08:00:

Ah, t'would make sense then.

### 459: [Cold War Danish squad size?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uwhxsb/cold_war_danish_squad_size/), submitted on 2022-05-24 11:45:35+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 461: [How were the relations between Imperial China and the tribes within and surrounding it?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uxdiwd/how_were_the_relations_between_imperial_china_and/), submitted on 2022-05-25 17:26:34+08:00.

More can of course be said, particularly regarding earlier periods in Chinese history, but I discuss indigenous matters during the Qing era in these answers:
