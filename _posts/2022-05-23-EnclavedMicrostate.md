### 455: [HololiveEN as well as Calli, Gura, Ame, Kronii, and Bae all have TikTok accounts.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/uvrtek/hololiveen_as_well_as_calli_gura_ame_kronii_and/), submitted on 2022-05-23 12:06:29+08:00.

----- __455.1__ -----2022-05-24 01:04:08+08:00:

I'd imagine there's a certain difference between approaching it as a corporate entity and approaching it as a private individual. One imagines a tech corporation would be aware of the appropriate security measures to take while still making use of the platform.

### 456: [Is it known for sure why HoloEN hasn’t really done 3D streams or lives outside of Calli?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/uvt9qc/is_it_known_for_sure_why_holoen_hasnt_really_done/), submitted on 2022-05-23 13:41:09+08:00.

No she then came back to Japan. Her situation’s complicated because of rehearsals for the live concert in July.

----- __456.2__ -----2022-05-23 17:24:07+08:00:

Well, the Priichu models + their setup have produced somewhat janky results, and I'd imagine nobody wants the first use of the official models by those members to be plagued by technical issues.

### 457: [The pure sass from both the commenter and mod here is hilarious to me](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uw0zmm/the_pure_sass_from_both_the_commenter_and_mod/), submitted on 2022-05-23 22:05:49+08:00.

----- __457.1__ -----2022-05-24 20:27:02+08:00:

It's not *un*common by any means, though. The study of Chinese history has always had a bit of an identity crisis between being a field of history and a subfield of Chinese cultural studies and it's only relatively recently that there's been a strong pivot to the former.

### 458: [Glorious Golden Glam - Weekly Discussion Thread, May 23rd, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/uw3c3q/glorious_golden_glam_weekly_discussion_thread_may/), submitted on 2022-05-23 23:51:25+08:00.

----- __458.1__ -----2022-05-25 18:16:33+08:00:

This is interesting; HoloJP's generally presumed to have had a 30-35-35 split between Youtube, Cover, and the talent, so Moona saying hers was 30-50-20 seems to be quite a big shift, unless she got the maths wrong since it contradicts what she says earlier in the clip.

----- __458.2__ -----2022-05-25 19:41:52+08:00:

Ah, t'would make sense then.

----- __458.3__ -----2022-05-26 00:43:16+08:00:

This is very much parroting others' takes from other spaces I'm in, but the impression I get is that South Korea has a strong *audience* for VTubers but serious problems producing local talents.

----- __458.4__ -----2022-05-26 15:15:42+08:00:

I probably should have been a little more precise in my language, although to be fair Isegye (whom I have heard of and know are successful) slipped my mind as well. More precisely, I meant to say that it seems like there's a certain difficulty (especially for an overseas-based agency) to maintain a substantial group of KR VTubers of sort of middling size (i.e. not full-time job level).

### 461: [Oh No](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/uxbah7/oh_no/), submitted on 2022-05-25 14:35:46+08:00.

----- __461.1__ -----2022-05-26 13:57:07+08:00:

To be fair, with NoeFure the two of them did also admit that the way they portrayed themselves on-stream wasn't really authentic to how they interacted offline. Plus, one can very easily imagine that if they are serious – which I'm inclined to believe they are – then it's not unreasonable that at some stage they might like to keep their relationship as something mostly between themselves. So while the fan obsession I think undoubtedly accelerated things, they would have gone more private about it sooner or later.

### 462: [How were the relations between Imperial China and the tribes within and surrounding it?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uxdiwd/how_were_the_relations_between_imperial_china_and/), submitted on 2022-05-25 17:26:34+08:00.

More can of course be said, particularly regarding earlier periods in Chinese history, but I discuss indigenous matters during the Qing era in these answers:

Cold-blooded murder. Sasuga dad.

### 465: [Can anyone recommend some good and in-depth podcasts about military history, present-day military theory, and other stuff relevant to the subject-matter of this subreddit?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/uxmyuq/can_anyone_recommend_some_good_and_indepth/), submitted on 2022-05-26 01:52:31+08:00.

----- __465.1__ -----2022-05-26 15:30:27+08:00:

But that's not an effective defence, on multiple levels:

* If you define a historian as anyone who 'does history', i.e. produces some form of consumable media presenting a narrative about the past, then Dan Carlin is by definition a historian and his assertions to the contrary are wrong.

* Whether or not he fits some abstract definition of 'historian', in producing consumable media presenting a narrative about the past, Carlin *ought* to have a responsibility to ensure that that narrative is as true as possible, based on the best information and analysis that is accessible to him.

* If there is already an understanding that Carlin's content is, from a historical perspective, sub-par, then why recommend him? Well-communicated misinformation is still misinformation.

Imagine if were to I go around performing surgeries while insisting I'm not a surgeon, and when someone bleeds out on the operating table I were to say 'I did say I wasn't a surgeon!', and when people complain about it other people go around defending me saying I'm not a surgeon, while also asserting that I should be allowed to perform surgery anyway.
