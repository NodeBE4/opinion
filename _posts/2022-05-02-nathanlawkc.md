1. Elected members are accountable to the public and should answer concerns from them. Instead, I received an email from @cllralexyip, who worked with Christine Lee in the BCR, requesting me to take down an article about his connections with Beijing to avoid “further steps.”

Re 3. In 2015, He was seen standing in front of a rally in support of Xi Jinping's visit. He had explained his role there as a mediating one but such claim has been questioned by many. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/alex-yip-conservative-councillor-accused-of-helping-organise-prochinese-demonstrations-during-state-visitl-a6708551.html?fbclid=IwAR012VD0LGi0FomgzUsRQXK7x7ACjlVbwDxHPMc0SoHiQWM6d99w4M9AQFU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/alex-yip-conservative-councillor-accused-of-helping-organise-prochinese-demonstrations-during-state-visitl-a6708551.html?fbclid=IwAR012VD0LGi0FomgzUsRQXK7x7ACjlVbwDxHPMc0SoHiQWM6d99w4M9AQFU</a>

Re 4. He was part of the British Chinese Project founded by Christine Lee. The MI5 released an unprecedented warning, alleging Lee acted covertly with the United Front Work Department of the CCP, and is "judged to be involved in political interference activities in the UK“.

Re 7. I believe I am utilizing publicly available resources to make these allegations in the interest of the public. Alex, as an elected councilor and candidate running for office in Sutton Wylde Green ward, should respond to these questions to reassure the public and the voters.

Re 9. Still, until now, he refuses to explain his relationship with Christine Lee. His connection with Lee is a matter of public interest. By hiding behind closed doors and refusing to clarify on this matter is disappointing and worrying to the voters and the Hongkongers community.

Re 10. This is especially in the interest of Hongkongers who are living in fear of Beijing’s long arm persecutions and interference. We must ask questions when we see politicians like Alex Yip who seemingly have close ties with the CCP, and raise the alarm.

Re 12. We must be aware of the infiltrations from the CCP that aim at influencing the politics in the UK and threaten British democracy and the Hongkongers community. I will not take down the post and stick to the spirit that I have a duty to my fellow Hongkongers.

Re 13. The brief translation of the original Facebook post  is as follows.<br>I invite Alex Yip to answer these concerns publicly, as a public figure and an elected politician.<br>-END<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR1ee2OXwAAaqP8?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR1ee2LWYAYlirr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re *had a typo in the first tweet. It is "BCP," British Chinese Project, instead of "BCR."
