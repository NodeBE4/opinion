1. Elected members are accountable to the public and should answer concerns from them. Instead, I received an email from @cllralexyip, who worked with Christine Lee in the BCR, requesting me to take down an article about his connections with Beijing to avoid ‚Äúfurther steps.‚Äù

Re 2. I posted this article on 27th April in Chinese, quoting many news articles and publicly available information to question  Alex Yip‚Äôs close connections to the united front activities. I made this comment with solid grounds:‚ÄÇ<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=570508737767134&amp;set=a.517027263115282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=570508737767134&amp;set=a.517027263115282</a>

Re 5. The real purpose of Christine Lee‚Äôs BCP is now under fierce scrutiny as it is believed to be an infiltration project from the CCP. He left the project when he was elected in 2017. After he left the BCP, he continued to have close connections with Lee.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07233413/officers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07233413/officers</a>

Re 6. He hosted an event in 2018 and invited Christine Lee. He was photographed with Christine Lee when meeting other politicians.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/conservatives-received-donation-from-suspected-chinese-agent-christine-lee-xqdlxqd7j?fbclid=IwAR1VIOUIivnz-KZylWS8md8i7u5P5sq5CA1dn5Xj2hNpMAaJ1_78TEOGsRw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/conservatives-received-donation-from-suspected-chinese-agent-christine-lee-xqdlxqd7j?fbclid=IwAR1VIOUIivnz-KZylWS8md8i7u5P5sq5CA1dn5Xj2hNpMAaJ1_78TEOGsRw</a>

Re 9. Still, until now, he refuses to explain his relationship with Christine Lee. His connection with Lee is a matter of public interest. By hiding behind closed doors and refusing to clarify on this matter is disappointing and worrying to the voters and the Hongkongers community.

Re 10. This is especially in the interest of Hongkongers who are living in fear of Beijing‚Äôs long arm persecutions and interference. We must ask questions when we see politicians like Alex Yip who seemingly have close ties with the CCP, and raise the alarm.

Re 12. We must be aware of the infiltrations from the CCP that aim at influencing the politics in the UK and threaten British democracy and the Hongkongers community. I will not take down the post and stick to the spirit that I have a duty to my fellow Hongkongers.

Re 13. The brief translation of the original Facebook post  is as follows.<br>I invite Alex Yip to answer these concerns publicly, as a public figure and an elected politician.<br>-END<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR1ee2OXwAAaqP8?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR1ee2LWYAYlirr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re *had a typo in the first tweet. It is "BCP," British Chinese Project, instead of "BCR."

The next Chief Executive of Hong Kong.<br><br>//By 2016, when Law was elected into the legislature, Lee "was already notoriously difficult to deal with" and seemed hostile to any journalists or opposition lawmakers who raised questions or challenges, Law said.//‚ÄÇ<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/asia/john-lee-hong-kong-chief-executive-intl-hnk-dst/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/asia/john-lee-hong-kong-chief-executive-intl-hnk-dst/index.html</a>
