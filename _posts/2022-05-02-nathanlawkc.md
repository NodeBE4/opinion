1. Elected members are accountable to the public and should answer concerns from them. Instead, I received an email from @cllralexyip, who worked with Christine Lee in the BCR, requesting me to take down an article about his connections with Beijing to avoid “further steps.”

Re 2. I posted this article on 27th April in Chinese, quoting many news articles and publicly available information to question  Alex Yip’s close connections to the united front activities. I made this comment with solid grounds: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=570508737767134&amp;set=a.517027263115282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=570508737767134&amp;set=a.517027263115282</a>

Re 4. He was part of the British Chinese Project founded by Christine Lee. The MI5 released an unprecedented warning, alleging Lee acted covertly with the United Front Work Department of the CCP, and is "judged to be involved in political interference activities in the UK“.

Re 6. He hosted an event in 2018 and invited Christine Lee. He was photographed with Christine Lee when meeting other politicians. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/conservatives-received-donation-from-suspected-chinese-agent-christine-lee-xqdlxqd7j?fbclid=IwAR1VIOUIivnz-KZylWS8md8i7u5P5sq5CA1dn5Xj2hNpMAaJ1_78TEOGsRw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/conservatives-received-donation-from-suspected-chinese-agent-christine-lee-xqdlxqd7j?fbclid=IwAR1VIOUIivnz-KZylWS8md8i7u5P5sq5CA1dn5Xj2hNpMAaJ1_78TEOGsRw</a>

Re 8. Rather, he chose to send me emails that hinted he may take “further steps” if I refuse to take down the “defamatory post.” It makes me worried that he has an intention to press a defamation case. I hope he can clarify on this point.

Re 10. This is especially in the interest of Hongkongers who are living in fear of Beijing’s long arm persecutions and interference. We must ask questions when we see politicians like Alex Yip who seemingly have close ties with the CCP, and raise the alarm.

Re 12. We must be aware of the infiltrations from the CCP that aim at influencing the politics in the UK and threaten British democracy and the Hongkongers community. I will not take down the post and stick to the spirit that I have a duty to my fellow Hongkongers.

Re 13. The brief translation of the original Facebook post  is as follows.<br>I invite Alex Yip to answer these concerns publicly, as a public figure and an elected politician.<br>-END<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR1ee2OXwAAaqP8?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR1ee2LWYAYlirr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re *had a typo in the first tweet. It is "BCP," British Chinese Project, instead of "BCR."
