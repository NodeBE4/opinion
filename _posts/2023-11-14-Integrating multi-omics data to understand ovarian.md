拍攝日期：2023/08/30主講人：Dr. Pei-Chen Peng（Assistant Professor, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Department of Computational Biomedicine）Precision cancer medicine leverages advances in genomics and computational methods towards a better life. The genomic data have to be integrated with diverse biomedical information and analyzed through biologically interpretable computational methods, before they can lead to biomedical discoveries.In this presentation, I will discuss our research on the integration of diverse biomedical data to understand ovarian cancer. First, I will describe a genome-to-disease bioinformatic pipeline that identifies the underlying cause of ovarian cancer initiation and development. Next, I will present an integrative multi-omics analysis that decipher the genomic landscape of ovarian tumor recurrence. These multi-omics approaches explore fundamental aspects of cancer biology and transform the way of scientific discovery.►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
