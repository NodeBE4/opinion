### 274: [Was Hong Xiuquan, leader of the Taiping rebellion a bad father?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tpvvpr/was_hong_xiuquan_leader_of_the_taiping_rebellion/), submitted on 2022-03-28 07:21:12+08:00.

----- __274.1__ -----2022-03-30 03:44:30+08:00:

Hong Xiuquan's issue is an interesting, er, issue, as it's not something discussed much in the historiography. But to answer this question we can't just talk about Hong Xiuquan's relationships with his children in a vacuum. We must first establish what the Taiping ideal of fatherhood was.

### What made a good Taiping father?

While references to domestic life are, unfortunately, few and far between in the surviving published Taiping material, they are not so absent that we cannot at least in some sense get an idea of what role parents, and specifically fathers, were supposed to play in the Taiping worldview.

Filial piety was of course doubly important to the Taiping, being both a critical dimension of Chinese belief systems as well as enshrined as the fifth of the Ten Commandments. Filial piety, framed through both 'native' Chinese and Christian lenses, was a recurring motif in Taiping texts, and every once in a while there would be some discussion of what parents, for their part, were supposed to do in return. The *Taiping Songs on World Salvation*, composed by the East King Yang Xiuqing and published in 1853, is the one that does so most substantially, with a portion of the second ode devoted to the matter. Here, Yang uses parents as an analogy for God, whom the Taiping consistently termed the Heavenly Father. As translated by Walter Medhurst, the section reads:

> Parents in the treatment of their children,  
> Are they ever free from anxiety?  
> They suckle them, nourish them with meat and drink;  
> In everything their minds are attentive.  
> By the time the children are somewhat older,  
> They are apprehensive of their committing faults;  
> Hence they teach them propriety and righteousness,  
> And all the day long they watch them.  
> There are no lengths to which they do not go,  
> Their love for their children is steadfast;  
> Such an inexhaustible amount of kindness,  
> When can it ever be repaid?

On the matter of fatherhood more specifically, though, we can turn to the *Youxueshi*, or *Ode for Youth*, and its sections on family:

> **On the Households' Way**

> The family members related by bone and flesh  
> Should in joy and harmony unite.  
> When the feeling of concord unites the whole,  
> Blessings will descend upon them from Heaven.

> **On the Fathers' Way**

> When the ridgepole is straight, nothing will be irregular below;  
> When the father is strict, the Way will be formed.  
> Let him not provoke his children to wrath,  
> And the whole dwelling will be filled with harmony.

It should be quite obvious now that the most important role of the father in the Taiping worldview was moral instruction. Taiping fathers were expected to correct misbehaviour and to instruct their children in proper behaviour, but not in such a way that they caused resentment. So, did Hong Xiuquan do that?

### Was Hong Xiuquan a good Taiping father?

While we don't know a huge amount about Hong Xiuquan's relationships with his children, we do know a decent amount about that with his heir apparent, Hong Tianguifu. Born Hong Tiangui in 1849, he briefly became Heavenly King upon his father's death in 1864, before being executed by the Qing after he was captured during an attempt to escape to Guangdong. Before his execution, however, he was required to write a confession, which, although brief, does give us a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the Taiping palace and of Hong Xiuquan's family life. Excerpting the relevant section, translated for publication in the *North China Herald* in 1865 (with some amendments):

> At the age of nine I had four wives given to me, and I was forbidden access to my mother or sisters. The old Heavenly King composed 'The Ten Poems on Salvation' for me to read. They are all n the reasons for keeping men aloof from women and forbidding intercourse between them. Some of the poems I still remember. I had a yearning for my mother and sisters after I reached my ninth year, and used to take advantage of when the old Heavenly King had business at court to steal a visit with them. The old Heavenly King told me to study religious books and would not allow me to study ancient books [i.e. the classics], which he said were all demonic. I managed, however, to read secretly thirty or more volumes, and still retain some recollection of their subjects and contents. I had never been outside the city gates.

While we do have surviving copies of *Ten Poems on Salvation*, their contents are not much more elaborate than what Hong Tianguifu describes above, and are frankly rather tedious. What is pretty clear from all this is that for his part, Hong Xiuquan *did* fulfil what the Taiping saw as the father's key responsibility: the moral instruction of the child. Practicing as he preached, he did indeed instruct his son in the reading of religious texts and in his particular vision of morals and ethics. However, he arguably failed to 'not provoke his children to wrath', given the very overt acts of rebellion that Tianguifu describes himself as having undertaken. Whether he was a good father or not to Tianguifu is thus perhaps a matter of perspective: in Xiuquan's own mind he was doing his duties as he had prescribed, but from Tianguifu's standpoint, Hong was overbearing at best and draconian at worst, failing in terms of the specifics of how that instruction was supposed to manifest.

Unfortunately, we know little else about Hong's relationships with his other children, particularly his two oldest daughters Tiangui, but this little slice does suggest that, at least with regards to his designated successor, he did take his perceived fatherly responsibilities seriously. Whether this was successful in execution is another matter, although it is perhaps worth noting that Tiangui's rebellion was as much against the beliefs (separation of the sexes and condemnation of the Confucian classics) themselves as it was their proponent.

I mean, we don't know what those announcements will be nor how long-term they are. Presumably it's not graduation of course, as that'd be basically one announcement to which everything else would be subordinate.

----- __275.2__ -----2022-03-29 18:20:35+08:00:

Oh right, well I was there for many of the announcements of announcements too (I watch Calli pretty religiously) so I think we just ended up talking past each other a bit.

There's a somewhat controversial, but in my view still pretty good [mini video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7prxvu_GiQ) by Alfo Media on the idea of a difference between 'white rappers' and 'white people who rap', with the distinction being their level of immersion in the (sub)culture of rap. Alfo Media suggests that 'white people who rap' are people who, in effect, approach rap from within, typically having worked their way into the established community and understand the substance as well as the form of the genre; by contrast, 'white rappers' are those who appropriate the forms of rap but with a markedly different substance reflective of a relatively privileged position, while staying outside actual rap culture. Whether this division is accurate in a detached, factual sense is one thing, but as a framing I think it does a bit to explain the hate here: Calli isn't someone who's 'part of' US rap culture the way Eminem or El-P are, and for a predominantly US-based Internet, that seems like a telltale sign of someone basically appropriating an art form without engaging with its core substance.

Now, what you and I know that most people coming across this drama don't is that, of course, she's not immersed in US rap culture because her aim was always the Japanese scene, which she definitely *has* been part of for some years now at this point. So in a sense the criticism isn't pure irrational hate; it does come from a place of not unreasonable hostility to white people simply barging into black spaces (arch-example being Vanilla Ice). But it is decidedly misplaced, based on incomplete information and simply being exposed to the definitely bad parts of her early career, and at most to her artistic output in a vacuum without appreciation of its context.

----- __275.5__ -----2022-04-04 13:09:45+08:00:

I'd say there's a difference between not allowing someone into a community, and being irked at that how said community's art form is being appropriated. If you're not familiar with the existence of a Japanese hip hop scene, which serves as Calli's primary influence, then it does pretty much come across as someone taking a culturally-specific art form out of that culture for their own benefit.

### 276: [Tuesday Trivia: Islam! This thread has relaxed standards—we invite everyone to participate!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tqz5aq/tuesday_trivia_islam_this_thread_has_relaxed/), submitted on 2022-03-29 20:56:46+08:00.

----- __276.1__ -----2022-03-29 22:19:00+08:00:

Nearly a year ago, I wrote [an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mn9mro/what_did_the_taiping_think_of_judaism_and_islam/gtwprn9/) to a question on Taiping views on Judaism and Islam, which I had a good amount of fun with and so will repost here.

____

> "There is no god but God, and Tai-ping-wang is the brother of Jesus."

This quotation adorns the title page of John Milton Mackie's *Life of Tai-Ping-Wang, Chief of the Chinese Insurrection* (1857), and for anyone familiar with English renditions of the *Shahada* (Muslim declaration of faith), it bears a striking resemblance, perhaps even intentionally on Mackie's part:

> I bear witness that there is no deity but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God.

The origin of the quote, however, is hard to pin down as Mackie does not cite any particular text, and I don't know anywhere near enough about Anglophone writing on Islam at this time to say whether there was any conscious attempt at allusion. But, there is little need to speculate on the motives of an American commentator who never went to China, and whose interest in the Taiping seems to have been a temporary affectation in a career otherwise focussed on German literature. If nothing else it's a neat detail, and does get those mental gears turning as to how the Taiping related to the other major Abrahamic faiths.

Now, the question as phrased is Judaism and then Islam, but given my lead-in I suppose I'll have to do it the other way around. The Taiping relationship with Islam is generally poorly attested. In the surviving corpus of texts by Taiping authors, Islam or Muslims appear a grand total of three times, and there is a single throwaway reference in a British report from 1859. However, few as these references are, we can mine quite a bit of information out of them.

Reverend Alexander Wylie, a British Protestant missionary and translator, visited Taiping territory as part of an informal British delegation in 1858, and reported on scenes of desolation and devastation owing to the ongoing war between the Taiping and Qing. Wylie was apparently interested to see what had become of the Catholic churches in the Yangtze valley, which French missionaries had reported the effective dissolution of back in 1853. He reported as follows in a letter published in July 1859 and probably written around January:

> There was no appearance of the existence of Roman Catholicism, but I found Mohammedan mosques still standing among the ruins at Chin-keang [Zhenjiang] and Nanking [Nanjing], and one demolished at Teih-keang [?Dijiang?].

With no further elaboration, all we have to go on is that the Taiping generally, but evidently not consistently, left Muslim places of worship as is, and generally, but not consistently, avoided persecuting Muslims in their territory. But this raises some interesting questions, the most important of which is, of course: *Why* were the Taiping not as concerned about Islam (at least up to 1858), when they were opposed to just about every other religious tradition, and did, even if by mistake, persecute Catholics?

A likely explanation, though a necessarily speculative one thanks to the paucity of primary evidence, is that Islam was not practiced by Han Chinese. Islam was the only major religion in the Qing Empire with a very specifically ethnic tie, with the Islam-practicing Hui being considered a distinct ethnicity from the majority Han. The definition of 'Hui' certainly changed over time, shifting from being mainly used for Muslims in Qing Turkestan, to any Muslims in the empire, to specific groups of Muslims (some Turcophone, some Sinophone) outside of Qing Turkestan, but it was nevertheless a marker of ethnic identity emerging largely out of religious background. Conversion to and from Islam was neither common nor expected, and so the two groups would remain distinct. As such, Islam may not have been considered a 'corruptive' force towards Han Chinese in the same way as Buddhism or Confucianism, or indeed for a brief while Catholicism (before the Taiping came to recognise their common origin).

Later in 1859, Hong Rengan, a cousin of the Taiping monarch Hong Xiuquan, arrived in Nanjing after a stint in Hong Kong as an apprentice translator for Protestant missionaries, and wrote a reform manifesto titled the *New Treatise on Aids in Administration* (資政新篇 *zizheng xinpian*). One of its sections, 'On the Rule of Law', advocates at one point for a move towards regularising foreign relations on equitable lines, as part of which Hong Rengan seems to have begun writing about the customs of foreign countries in order to explain the proper etiquette for each of them, but after the first entry he largely opts to describe their admirable and/or condemnable features to serve as either positive or negative exemplars for the Taiping kingdom. As part of this, he comes to describe three majority-Muslim regions, those being the Ottoman Empire, Iran (then ruled by the Qajars), and the Eyalet of Egypt:

> Turkey, in the southwestern part of which lies the ancient state of Israel, borders Russia on its northwest. As the people of this country do not believe that Jesus Christ is the Saviour, they still cling to the Mosaic Law, without change or modification. Hence, the country is not strong. [In the year 1856], it was invaded by the Russians and was rescued from catastrophe through the assistance rendered by England and France. This country, being the sacred place where the Heavenly Elder Brother was born, must eventually be converted to Christianity, for it is said in the New Testament that when the ten thousand nations of the world have been converted to the faith, Israel will be ashamed.

> [two other sections]

> Persia lies to the southeast of Israel. The Persians worship one of God’s creations, namely, the sun. They do not eat dogs or pigs and they believe in the demon Buddha. At present, though they are called Persians, their land is in reality under foreign domination, of which they are not ashamed. They seek only after wealth and power, never fighting for honour; hence they wander about, moving around with outers, without the slightest sense of loyalty or discipline. They resemble the Chinese of today who have no sense of shame under the domination of the Manchus. This is so because each is concerned only with his own welfare and has no means of achieving unity.

> Egypt, also known as Masri, is situated to the southwest of Israel, with the Red Sea as its boundary. In this place there is no cold in the entire year, and it is extremely hot in the summers. There is a mountain called Ya-la-pe, which is the highest in the world. It was on this mountain that Noah’s Ark was anchored. It is covered with clouds during all four seasons, and its summit is rarely seen. The Egyptians have never seen rain or snow, nor have they ever heard the sound of thunder. In this land there are few springs, but there is much desert. During the time between spring and summer, clouds gather atop the mountain, and waterfalls race down in all directions. Just before the water recedes, the farmers sow their seeds in the fields; by the time the water subsides, the sprouts are growing luxuriantly. This is so because the mountain is high and reaches the clouds, and the ascending hot air freezes on the mountain peak without ever evaporating. Consequently, rain does not fall upon the wilderness, thunder does not clap on the earth, ice forms constantly on the high summit, and snow never flutters over the warm ground. At present, the people there worship Joseph and Moses as their sages, and their religion is called Islam [*Huihui jiao*], for our Heavenly Father, God, once displayed his power to these two men, and their virtues have remained known to this day. 

As can be seen, Hong Rengan only explicitly identifies the Egyptians as Muslims, although it's possible to backtrack a bit and say that he implies the Turks were, too, if the criterion was the importance of Joseph and Moses. Muhammad is of course absent from his description of Islam. It is interesting that the assessment of Islam is not *wholly* negative. On the one hand, he is critical of the Turks for following the Mosaic Law but not also the New Testament, and clearly advocates for Christian proselytisation in the region. On the other hand, at least in terms of tone, his view of the Egyptians' reverence of Joseph and Moses seems reasonably favourable. The section on Persia seems completely off religion-wise, but could well be based on first- or second-hand encounters with Zoroastrian Parsis in Hong Kong – [see this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mklhxj/what_is_the_history_of_chinas_relationship_with/gtnkgu5/) which I had with /u/Xuande88.

Obviously we cannot extrapolate Hong Rengan's writings too far: he was, after all, just one person, and moreover he was one person who had rejoined the fold relatively recently and had not been present for developments in Taiping ideology in his absence. However, Hong's more global view of Christianity does seem to have filtered into the wider Taiping leadership, so we could surmise that there was some heightened awareness of Islam as a global religion, but without much actual understanding of the religion itself.

----- __276.2__ -----2022-03-29 22:19:22+08:00:



The last reference we have to the Taiping and Islam – in a Taiping or Western source, anyway – is in fact right near the end of the last Taiping document, the confession of Lai Wenguang, a general who escaped the fall of the kingdom in 1864 and led a mixed force of Taiping veterans and Nian rebels in northern China, nearly capturing Beijing in 1866. His fortunes faded rapidly, and he was captured in January 1868, writing a brief confession before his execution in which he stated:

> ...in the autumn of *bingyin*, the sixteenth year [i.e., 1866 – the sixteenth year since the founding of the Heavenly Kingdom in 1851], I specially ordered the Liang Wang, Zhang Zongyu, the Young Wu Wang, Zhang Yuque, and the Huai Wang, Qiu Yuancai, to advance to Gansu and Shaanxi and make an alliance with the Muslims for the purpose of mutual assistance. But Heaven did not protect me, and I arrived at my present state. What more can I say?

As with Hong Rengan, Lai was only one person, but it does seem, from the way he frames his confession, that he did see himself as continuing the Taiping war effort, retaining the use of the Taiping year number and of Taiping titles for his subordinates (although it seems that at least Zhang Zongyu's was in fact self-assigned). Whether he believed an alliance was viable for religious or purely pragmatic reasons is of course not stated, but it is perhaps worth noting that the Taiping did actually help kick off the Muslim rebellions in the northwest. When detachments of Shi Dakai's expeditionary force arrived in the Gansu borderlands in 1862, communities across the religious divide armed themselves in anticipation, and the Muslim militias may have sought to ally with the Taiping against their local non-Muslim rivals. It would have been reasonable, therefore, for Lai to expect at least some Muslim groups to be amenable to allying with the Taiping survivors. 

Moreover, other accounts, though not from Taiping writers, show that there was active cooperation between Muslim and Taiping forces well before 1866, and this cooperation involved Lai himself. Lai had ended up in the north as part of a failed Taiping-Nian expedition towards Beijing that was supposed to be led by Chen Yucheng in early 1862, but which had more or less failed before it started when Chen and his retinue were besieged at Luzhou. The other Taiping generals pressed on regardless, and were supported by several points by Muslim forces from Yunnan under Lan Dashun and Lan Ershun, which had originally attempted to link with the Taiping renegade Shi Dakai under orders from the Yunnanese rebel ruler Du Wenxiu.

Our understanding of Taiping-Muslim cooperation during the lifetime of the kingdom itself, however, is complicated somewhat by an earlier confession by Li Xiucheng, the old Taiping commander-in-chief, who, at the time of his execution in July 1864, denied that there was any contact between the Taiping and the Muslim rebels of Yunnan, Gansu and Shaanxi. The information need not contradict the above: the Yunnanese were mainly interested in Shi Dakai, who had gone rogue in 1858, while Lai Wenguang's survivors were seeking out the Gansu and Shaanxi rebels some two years after Li Xiucheng's death. But the fact that the Yunnanese sought out the Taiping, and that Lai only sought refuge in Shaanxi in desperation, suggests that the Taiping were, by and large, not approaching the Muslim rebels as natural allies.

The material for Judaism is simultaneously more extensive and more scant than for Islam, depending on how you want to approach it. We could talk endlessly about Biblical Hebrews and Jews, as the Taiping obviously held the Old Testament as one of their three principal canons (the others being the New Testament and the Taiping's own textual corpus), and like most conventional Protestants they were perfectly willing to accept the conceit that Jews pre-Christ were theologically valid and God's chosen people. Indeed, one of the earliest Taiping texts to adapt Biblical scripture, the *Three-Character Classic* (1853), includes a lengthy section on the Plagues of Egypt and the Exodus, which if read in a metaphorical sense can be understood as analogous to the Taiping: God sent Moses to inflict the plagues upon the Egyptians and liberate his chosen people, the Hebrews; God has sent Hong Xiuquan to inflict punishment upon the Manchus and liberate his chosen people, the Han.

But when it comes to contemporary Jews, the Taiping really say very little, which is perhaps unsurprising: the only significant Jewish population in China was an enclave a couple of hundred strong in Kaifeng (which still exists today), the surviving sources for which have always been patchy. We know that the Taiping captured Kaifeng for a time in 1857, which (as was often the case in the Taiping War) led to severe damage by the time the Qing retook it, and we know that the synagogue, which was in disrepair by 1850, had clearly been demolished by 1866. It is unclear if this was due to Taiping action, but the reports from the Kaifeng Jews themselves, limited and often vague as they were, suggest that it was likely a natural result of the state of disrepair not only of the structure but indeed of the community writ large, rather than any intentional act of destruction by an outside party.

No Taiping sources survive for the occupation of Kaifeng which detail their position with regards to the Jewish population, but there is one(!) source that does, if briefly, mention the Kaifeng enclave, and it is, surprise, surprise, Hong Rengan in the *New Treatise on Aids in Administration*. Immediately following on from the section on the Ottoman Empire, he writes:

> The Jews, forty years after Jesus Christ’s ascent to heaven, were angrily punished by God and driven out of Israel; those who believed in Jesus Christ also escaped to other countries. That there are now Jews in every country is proof and evidence of this, and it is also the will of our Heavenly Father. In China for example, there are many Jewish people in Xiangfu *xian* of Kaifeng prefecture, Henan, with their sheepskin books on which Hebrew words are written. But these people, from Song to the present day, in the space of many years, have merely observed the rituals without knowing the words or the real meaning. When asked why they follow their religion, their answer is that they are hoping for the birth of Christ the Saviour. Jews of other countries are also like this; they do not believe that the Saviour was born 1,859 years ago.

This is pretty conventional stuff for someone instructed by Protestant missionaries, especially the notion of Jews being ignorant of the arrival of the Saviour. Its rather critical view of the Kaifeng Jewish community is in accord with other contemporary sources: letters by the Jews themselves and by Christian visitors to the city show that the community was very much in decline, with virtually nobody still literate in Hebrew since the death of the last rabbi some fifty years earlier. It is still unfortunate and inconvenient for our purposes that Hong Rengan says nothing of what might be done, nor does he make any reference to the earlier Taiping attack and its implications.

So that's a lot about individual texts and their implications, now let's pull it all together. The Taiping, or at least some among them, were clearly cognisant of the status of Judaism and Islam as fellow Abrahamic monotheistic faiths. Insofar as we have any assessment of what they thought of the religions as practiced (which comes entirely from Hong Rengan), they seem to have been relatively ambivalent, appreciating that they did have a common recognition of the Old Testament, but seeing their own religion as more advanced and closer to God's intentions. Possibly for reasons of ethnic nationalism, the Taiping generally made no effort to deliberately destroy places of worship, at least for Islam – the destruction of the Dijiang mosque may have been an outlier or the result of collateral damage, while there is no explicit causal link between the Taiping capture of Kaifeng and the destruction of its synagogue, which could have been at any point between 1852 and 1866. And, the Taiping were very much willing to work with Muslim military allies, but this was largely for pragmatic reasons. So, not a wholehearted embrace as coreligionists, but also not a zealous objection to all deviations from the Taiping faith.

To be honest, only Gen 3 and EN have been explicitly themed (and even then, pirates aren't 'fantasy' as such). HoloX does have the secret society schtick but arguably that only serves as a lore backstory for 5 members who would, without it, be pretty different (Iroha especially stands out a bit lore-wise). So it's not that ID is the exception, but that EN is.

----- __281.2__ -----2022-03-31 12:38:43+08:00:

My general impression is that it tends only to be a feature of old-ish buildings and that newer ones won't skip 4s at all, and that anything with more than 40 storeys will be newer, but... I have nothing to back that up. According to a government website on the matter, 44 might be skipped, but not the entire run of 40s.

However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question.

### 289: [How did the Romans stop water from the aqueducts from overflowing?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tspjm7/how_did_the_romans_stop_water_from_the_aqueducts/), submitted on 2022-03-31 10:23:25+08:00.

----- __289.1__ -----2022-03-31 13:23:33+08:00:

They didn't. Or, well, it's a little more complicated than that.

Here I'll exclusively be discussing the city of Rome, as that's the bit of the aqueducts I'm familiar with, albeit primarily from Frontinus' *de Aquaeductu* rather than from the archaeological evidence which I fully admit that others understand better. Frontinus, who was appointed supervisor of the aqueducts by Nerva in 97 CE and retained this posting for at least part of the reign of Trajan, notes that there were in fact regulations to deal with the result of overflow, rather than prevent it:

> 94: We have further to indicate what is the law with regard to conducting and safeguarding the waters, the first of which treats of the limitation of private parties to the measure of their grants, and the second has reference to the upkeep of the conduits themselves. In this connection, in going back to ancient laws enacted with regard to individual aqueducts, I found certain points wherein the practice of our forefathers differed from ours. With them all water was delivered for the public use, and the law was as follows: "No private person shall conduct other water than that which flows from the basins to the ground" (for these are the words of the law); that is, water which overflows from the troughs; we call it "lapsed" water;​ and even this was not granted for any other use than for baths or fulling establishments; and it was subject to a tax, for a fee was fixed, to be paid into the public treasury. Some water also was conceded to the houses of the principal citizens, with the consent of the others.

> 110: Those waters also that are called "lapsed," namely, those that come from the overflow of the reservoirs or from leakage of the pipes, are subject to grants; which are wont to be given very sparingly, however, by the sovereign. But this offers opportunity for thefts by the water-men; and how much care should be devoted to preventing these, may be seen from a paragraph of an ordinance, which I append:

> 111" "I desire that no one shall draw 'lapsed' water except those who have permission to do so by grants from me or preceding sovereigns; for there must necessarily be some overflow from the reservoirs, this being proper not only for the health of our City, but also for use in the flushing of the sewers."

In effect, the Romans were happy to have more water than they needed, and traditionally, any excess water could essentially be bought and resold by private parties that collected it, a legal principle that helped contribute to the corruption issues in the water administration that would lead to Frontinus' appointment. Presumably, if his proposals were ratified by Trajan, then this would have been amended somewhat by the 2nd century by requiring a specific grant to allow such private parties to collect excess water, and earmarking a portion for flushing the sewage system.

That is not to say that the situation in Rome was universal across the empire, of course. Vitruvius, in his section on aqueducts, describes what is essentially an ideal aqueduct system, and for his part suggests that cities should aim to supply enough water for public needs, with any excess going to private parties that had paid for a connection to the water supply:

> 1. [...] When they are brought home to the walls of the city a reservoir (*castellum*) is built, with a triple cistern attached to it to receive the water. In the reservoir are three pipes of equal sizes, and so connected that when the water overflows at the extremities, it is discharged into the middle one,

> 2. in which are placed pipes for the supply of the fountains, in the second those for the supply of the baths, thus affording a yearly revenue to the people; in the third, those for the supply of private houses. This is to be so managed that the water for public use may never be deficient, for that cannot be diverted if the mains from the heads are rightly constructed. I have made this division in order that the rent which is collected from private individuals who are supplied with water, may be applied by collectors to the maintenance of the aqueduct.

In effect, by placing the distribution pipes for the public services lower down, they would get water first, and any excess would then go to private parties. That said, Vitruvius does not discuss the matter of 'lapsed' water, i.e. leaks and overflow, principally as he is more interested in the infrastructure than the administration.

As for whether there were limits on flow at baths and fountains, this does not seem to have been the case at all. Baths largely took poorer-quality water, wastage of which was not particularly serious as it was not for drinking; fountains were supposed to flow constantly, so a bit of wastage would be unfortunate but not by any means fatal. But more importantly, the output of the fountains was probably monitored in some way, and in Rome at least, the Senate did hold power over the quantity of public fountains and could mandate increases or decreases, such that in the longer term, fountain output was generally kept stable.

Weirdly, this isn't the first time Demondice's past use of racial slurs has come up, as there was apparently some discussion of whether that might be a bit of a ticking time bomb for her during Mori Calliope's debut. What's interesting is there is, effectively, more than one issue on the line here. Quite apart from the question of whether people will be willing to allow her to move on, there's also the matter of how to deal with the notion that Calli and DDK are separate identities even if they are adopted by the same person, given that it's been DDK coming under fire for something that was kicked off by something featured on the Calli side of things.

But as with many things, there is a question of whether it will all blow over as a bit of a nothingburger in a matter of days or weeks, like the Nene tracing incident.

On that latter aspect, I agree it's interesting though not necessarily on the majority white Anglospheric audience side, at least not entirely. From the numbers that have gone around lately, her Japanese audience seems decently substantial as well, given her album charted at #4 on Billboard Japan's top downloaded albums in its first week. While a numerical minority it's definitely not just a niche of her audience, and it seems like concern about the 'watering down' on the Japanese side of things comes about kind of externally, from people with an investment in 'authentic' or 'accurate' representations of Japan and its culture internationally, which is a bit of a separate matter from reception of that work within Japan. What might seem like 'watering down' to a particularly conscious outside viewer may, within Japan, be received as entirely innocuous.

----- __297.4__ -----2022-04-04 14:08:58+08:00:

I wonder if it'll go the other way – if they sort of recognise that the whole separation of identities thing is a bit of a relic of the days of Activ8, and that enough of the small players don't bother with it that the big dogs like Holo and Niji can drop the act too.
