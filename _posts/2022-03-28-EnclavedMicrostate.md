I mean, we don't know what those announcements will be nor how long-term they are. Presumably it's not graduation of course, as that'd be basically one announcement to which everything else would be subordinate.

Oh right, well I was there for many of the announcements of announcements too (I watch Calli pretty religiously) so I think we just ended up talking past each other a bit.

Nearly a year ago, I wrote [an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mn9mro/what_did_the_taiping_think_of_judaism_and_islam/gtwprn9/) to a question on Taiping views on Judaism and Islam, which I had a good amount of fun with and so will repost here.

____

> "There is no god but God, and Tai-ping-wang is the brother of Jesus."

This quotation adorns the title page of John Milton Mackie's *Life of Tai-Ping-Wang, Chief of the Chinese Insurrection* (1857), and for anyone familiar with English renditions of the *Shahada* (Muslim declaration of faith), it bears a striking resemblance, perhaps even intentionally on Mackie's part:

> I bear witness that there is no deity but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God.

The origin of the quote, however, is hard to pin down as Mackie does not cite any particular text, and I don't know anywhere near enough about Anglophone writing on Islam at this time to say whether there was any conscious attempt at allusion. But, there is little need to speculate on the motives of an American commentator who never went to China, and whose interest in the Taiping seems to have been a temporary affectation in a career otherwise focussed on German literature. If nothing else it's a neat detail, and does get those mental gears turning as to how the Taiping related to the other major Abrahamic faiths.

Now, the question as phrased is Judaism and then Islam, but given my lead-in I suppose I'll have to do it the other way around. The Taiping relationship with Islam is generally poorly attested. In the surviving corpus of texts by Taiping authors, Islam or Muslims appear a grand total of three times, and there is a single throwaway reference in a British report from 1859. However, few as these references are, we can mine quite a bit of information out of them.

Reverend Alexander Wylie, a British Protestant missionary and translator, visited Taiping territory as part of an informal British delegation in 1858, and reported on scenes of desolation and devastation owing to the ongoing war between the Taiping and Qing. Wylie was apparently interested to see what had become of the Catholic churches in the Yangtze valley, which French missionaries had reported the effective dissolution of back in 1853. He reported as follows in a letter published in July 1859 and probably written around January:

> There was no appearance of the existence of Roman Catholicism, but I found Mohammedan mosques still standing among the ruins at Chin-keang [Zhenjiang] and Nanking [Nanjing], and one demolished at Teih-keang [?Dijiang?].

With no further elaboration, all we have to go on is that the Taiping generally, but evidently not consistently, left Muslim places of worship as is, and generally, but not consistently, avoided persecuting Muslims in their territory. But this raises some interesting questions, the most important of which is, of course: *Why* were the Taiping not as concerned about Islam (at least up to 1858), when they were opposed to just about every other religious tradition, and did, even if by mistake, persecute Catholics?

A likely explanation, though a necessarily speculative one thanks to the paucity of primary evidence, is that Islam was not practiced by Han Chinese. Islam was the only major religion in the Qing Empire with a very specifically ethnic tie, with the Islam-practicing Hui being considered a distinct ethnicity from the majority Han. The definition of 'Hui' certainly changed over time, shifting from being mainly used for Muslims in Qing Turkestan, to any Muslims in the empire, to specific groups of Muslims (some Turcophone, some Sinophone) outside of Qing Turkestan, but it was nevertheless a marker of ethnic identity emerging largely out of religious background. Conversion to and from Islam was neither common nor expected, and so the two groups would remain distinct. As such, Islam may not have been considered a 'corruptive' force towards Han Chinese in the same way as Buddhism or Confucianism, or indeed for a brief while Catholicism (before the Taiping came to recognise their common origin).

Later in 1859, Hong Rengan, a cousin of the Taiping monarch Hong Xiuquan, arrived in Nanjing after a stint in Hong Kong as an apprentice translator for Protestant missionaries, and wrote a reform manifesto titled the *New Treatise on Aids in Administration* (資政新篇 *zizheng xinpian*). One of its sections, 'On the Rule of Law', advocates at one point for a move towards regularising foreign relations on equitable lines, as part of which Hong Rengan seems to have begun writing about the customs of foreign countries in order to explain the proper etiquette for each of them, but after the first entry he largely opts to describe their admirable and/or condemnable features to serve as either positive or negative exemplars for the Taiping kingdom. As part of this, he comes to describe three majority-Muslim regions, those being the Ottoman Empire, Iran (then ruled by the Qajars), and the Eyalet of Egypt:

> Turkey, in the southwestern part of which lies the ancient state of Israel, borders Russia on its northwest. As the people of this country do not believe that Jesus Christ is the Saviour, they still cling to the Mosaic Law, without change or modification. Hence, the country is not strong. [In the year 1856], it was invaded by the Russians and was rescued from catastrophe through the assistance rendered by England and France. This country, being the sacred place where the Heavenly Elder Brother was born, must eventually be converted to Christianity, for it is said in the New Testament that when the ten thousand nations of the world have been converted to the faith, Israel will be ashamed.

> [two other sections]

> Persia lies to the southeast of Israel. The Persians worship one of God’s creations, namely, the sun. They do not eat dogs or pigs and they believe in the demon Buddha. At present, though they are called Persians, their land is in reality under foreign domination, of which they are not ashamed. They seek only after wealth and power, never fighting for honour; hence they wander about, moving around with outers, without the slightest sense of loyalty or discipline. They resemble the Chinese of today who have no sense of shame under the domination of the Manchus. This is so because each is concerned only with his own welfare and has no means of achieving unity.

> Egypt, also known as Masri, is situated to the southwest of Israel, with the Red Sea as its boundary. In this place there is no cold in the entire year, and it is extremely hot in the summers. There is a mountain called Ya-la-pe, which is the highest in the world. It was on this mountain that Noah’s Ark was anchored. It is covered with clouds during all four seasons, and its summit is rarely seen. The Egyptians have never seen rain or snow, nor have they ever heard the sound of thunder. In this land there are few springs, but there is much desert. During the time between spring and summer, clouds gather atop the mountain, and waterfalls race down in all directions. Just before the water recedes, the farmers sow their seeds in the fields; by the time the water subsides, the sprouts are growing luxuriantly. This is so because the mountain is high and reaches the clouds, and the ascending hot air freezes on the mountain peak without ever evaporating. Consequently, rain does not fall upon the wilderness, thunder does not clap on the earth, ice forms constantly on the high summit, and snow never flutters over the warm ground. At present, the people there worship Joseph and Moses as their sages, and their religion is called Islam [*Huihui jiao*], for our Heavenly Father, God, once displayed his power to these two men, and their virtues have remained known to this day. 

As can be seen, Hong Rengan only explicitly identifies the Egyptians as Muslims, although it's possible to backtrack a bit and say that he implies the Turks were, too, if the criterion was the importance of Joseph and Moses. Muhammad is of course absent from his description of Islam. It is interesting that the assessment of Islam is not *wholly* negative. On the one hand, he is critical of the Turks for following the Mosaic Law but not also the New Testament, and clearly advocates for Christian proselytisation in the region. On the other hand, at least in terms of tone, his view of the Egyptians' reverence of Joseph and Moses seems reasonably favourable. The section on Persia seems completely off religion-wise, but could well be based on first- or second-hand encounters with Zoroastrian Parsis in Hong Kong – [see this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mklhxj/what_is_the_history_of_chinas_relationship_with/gtnkgu5/) which I had with /u/Xuande88.

Obviously we cannot extrapolate Hong Rengan's writings too far: he was, after all, just one person, and moreover he was one person who had rejoined the fold relatively recently and had not been present for developments in Taiping ideology in his absence. However, Hong's more global view of Christianity does seem to have filtered into the wider Taiping leadership, so we could surmise that there was some heightened awareness of Islam as a global religion, but without much actual understanding of the religion itself.

The last reference we have to the Taiping and Islam – in a Taiping or Western source, anyway – is in fact right near the end of the last Taiping document, the confession of Lai Wenguang, a general who escaped the fall of the kingdom in 1864 and led a mixed force of Taiping veterans and Nian rebels in northern China, nearly capturing Beijing in 1866. His fortunes faded rapidly, and he was captured in January 1868, writing a brief confession before his execution in which he stated:

> ...in the autumn of *bingyin*, the sixteenth year [i.e., 1866 – the sixteenth year since the founding of the Heavenly Kingdom in 1851], I specially ordered the Liang Wang, Zhang Zongyu, the Young Wu Wang, Zhang Yuque, and the Huai Wang, Qiu Yuancai, to advance to Gansu and Shaanxi and make an alliance with the Muslims for the purpose of mutual assistance. But Heaven did not protect me, and I arrived at my present state. What more can I say?

As with Hong Rengan, Lai was only one person, but it does seem, from the way he frames his confession, that he did see himself as continuing the Taiping war effort, retaining the use of the Taiping year number and of Taiping titles for his subordinates (although it seems that at least Zhang Zongyu's was in fact self-assigned). Whether he believed an alliance was viable for religious or purely pragmatic reasons is of course not stated, but it is perhaps worth noting that the Taiping did actually help kick off the Muslim rebellions in the northwest. When detachments of Shi Dakai's expeditionary force arrived in the Gansu borderlands in 1862, communities across the religious divide armed themselves in anticipation, and the Muslim militias may have sought to ally with the Taiping against their local non-Muslim rivals. It would have been reasonable, therefore, for Lai to expect at least some Muslim groups to be amenable to allying with the Taiping survivors. 

Moreover, other accounts, though not from Taiping writers, show that there was active cooperation between Muslim and Taiping forces well before 1866, and this cooperation involved Lai himself. Lai had ended up in the north as part of a failed Taiping-Nian expedition towards Beijing that was supposed to be led by Chen Yucheng in early 1862, but which had more or less failed before it started when Chen and his retinue were besieged at Luzhou. The other Taiping generals pressed on regardless, and were supported by several points by Muslim forces from Yunnan under Lan Dashun and Lan Ershun, which had originally attempted to link with the Taiping renegade Shi Dakai under orders from the Yunnanese rebel ruler Du Wenxiu.

Our understanding of Taiping-Muslim cooperation during the lifetime of the kingdom itself, however, is complicated somewhat by an earlier confession by Li Xiucheng, the old Taiping commander-in-chief, who, at the time of his execution in July 1864, denied that there was any contact between the Taiping and the Muslim rebels of Yunnan, Gansu and Shaanxi. The information need not contradict the above: the Yunnanese were mainly interested in Shi Dakai, who had gone rogue in 1858, while Lai Wenguang's survivors were seeking out the Gansu and Shaanxi rebels some two years after Li Xiucheng's death. But the fact that the Yunnanese sought out the Taiping, and that Lai only sought refuge in Shaanxi in desperation, suggests that the Taiping were, by and large, not approaching the Muslim rebels as natural allies.

The material for Judaism is simultaneously more extensive and more scant than for Islam, depending on how you want to approach it. We could talk endlessly about Biblical Hebrews and Jews, as the Taiping obviously held the Old Testament as one of their three principal canons (the others being the New Testament and the Taiping's own textual corpus), and like most conventional Protestants they were perfectly willing to accept the conceit that Jews pre-Christ were theologically valid and God's chosen people. Indeed, one of the earliest Taiping texts to adapt Biblical scripture, the *Three-Character Classic* (1853), includes a lengthy section on the Plagues of Egypt and the Exodus, which if read in a metaphorical sense can be understood as analogous to the Taiping: God sent Moses to inflict the plagues upon the Egyptians and liberate his chosen people, the Hebrews; God has sent Hong Xiuquan to inflict punishment upon the Manchus and liberate his chosen people, the Han.

But when it comes to contemporary Jews, the Taiping really say very little, which is perhaps unsurprising: the only significant Jewish population in China was an enclave a couple of hundred strong in Kaifeng (which still exists today), the surviving sources for which have always been patchy. We know that the Taiping captured Kaifeng for a time in 1857, which (as was often the case in the Taiping War) led to severe damage by the time the Qing retook it, and we know that the synagogue, which was in disrepair by 1850, had clearly been demolished by 1866. It is unclear if this was due to Taiping action, but the reports from the Kaifeng Jews themselves, limited and often vague as they were, suggest that it was likely a natural result of the state of disrepair not only of the structure but indeed of the community writ large, rather than any intentional act of destruction by an outside party.

No Taiping sources survive for the occupation of Kaifeng which detail their position with regards to the Jewish population, but there is one(!) source that does, if briefly, mention the Kaifeng enclave, and it is, surprise, surprise, Hong Rengan in the *New Treatise on Aids in Administration*. Immediately following on from the section on the Ottoman Empire, he writes:

> The Jews, forty years after Jesus Christ’s ascent to heaven, were angrily punished by God and driven out of Israel; those who believed in Jesus Christ also escaped to other countries. That there are now Jews in every country is proof and evidence of this, and it is also the will of our Heavenly Father. In China for example, there are many Jewish people in Xiangfu *xian* of Kaifeng prefecture, Henan, with their sheepskin books on which Hebrew words are written. But these people, from Song to the present day, in the space of many years, have merely observed the rituals without knowing the words or the real meaning. When asked why they follow their religion, their answer is that they are hoping for the birth of Christ the Saviour. Jews of other countries are also like this; they do not believe that the Saviour was born 1,859 years ago.

This is pretty conventional stuff for someone instructed by Protestant missionaries, especially the notion of Jews being ignorant of the arrival of the Saviour. Its rather critical view of the Kaifeng Jewish community is in accord with other contemporary sources: letters by the Jews themselves and by Christian visitors to the city show that the community was very much in decline, with virtually nobody still literate in Hebrew since the death of the last rabbi some fifty years earlier. It is still unfortunate and inconvenient for our purposes that Hong Rengan says nothing of what might be done, nor does he make any reference to the earlier Taiping attack and its implications.

So that's a lot about individual texts and their implications, now let's pull it all together. The Taiping, or at least some among them, were clearly cognisant of the status of Judaism and Islam as fellow Abrahamic monotheistic faiths. Insofar as we have any assessment of what they thought of the religions as practiced (which comes entirely from Hong Rengan), they seem to have been relatively ambivalent, appreciating that they did have a common recognition of the Old Testament, but seeing their own religion as more advanced and closer to God's intentions. Possibly for reasons of ethnic nationalism, the Taiping generally made no effort to deliberately destroy places of worship, at least for Islam – the destruction of the Dijiang mosque may have been an outlier or the result of collateral damage, while there is no explicit causal link between the Taiping capture of Kaifeng and the destruction of its synagogue, which could have been at any point between 1852 and 1866. And, the Taiping were very much willing to work with Muslim military allies, but this was largely for pragmatic reasons. So, not a wholehearted embrace as coreligionists, but also not a zealous objection to all deviations from the Taiping faith.
