### 274: [Was Hong Xiuquan, leader of the Taiping rebellion a bad father?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tpvvpr/was_hong_xiuquan_leader_of_the_taiping_rebellion/), submitted on 2022-03-28 07:21:12+08:00.

----- __274.1__ -----2022-03-30 03:44:30+08:00:

Hong Xiuquan's issue is an interesting, er, issue, as it's not something discussed much in the historiography. But to answer this question we can't just talk about Hong Xiuquan's relationships with his children in a vacuum. We must first establish what the Taiping ideal of fatherhood was.

### What made a good Taiping father?

While references to domestic life are, unfortunately, few and far between in the surviving published Taiping material, they are not so absent that we cannot at least in some sense get an idea of what role parents, and specifically fathers, were supposed to play in the Taiping worldview.

Filial piety was of course doubly important to the Taiping, being both a critical dimension of Chinese belief systems as well as enshrined as the fifth of the Ten Commandments. Filial piety, framed through both 'native' Chinese and Christian lenses, was a recurring motif in Taiping texts, and every once in a while there would be some discussion of what parents, for their part, were supposed to do in return. The *Taiping Songs on World Salvation*, composed by the East King Yang Xiuqing and published in 1853, is the one that does so most substantially, with a portion of the second ode devoted to the matter. Here, Yang uses parents as an analogy for God, whom the Taiping consistently termed the Heavenly Father. As translated by Walter Medhurst, the section reads:

> Parents in the treatment of their children,  
> Are they ever free from anxiety?  
> They suckle them, nourish them with meat and drink;  
> In everything their minds are attentive.  
> By the time the children are somewhat older,  
> They are apprehensive of their committing faults;  
> Hence they teach them propriety and righteousness,  
> And all the day long they watch them.  
> There are no lengths to which they do not go,  
> Their love for their children is steadfast;  
> Such an inexhaustible amount of kindness,  
> When can it ever be repaid?

On the matter of fatherhood more specifically, though, we can turn to the *Youxueshi*, or *Ode for Youth*, and its sections on family:

> **On the Households' Way**

> The family members related by bone and flesh  
> Should in joy and harmony unite.  
> When the feeling of concord unites the whole,  
> Blessings will descend upon them from Heaven.

> **On the Fathers' Way**

> When the ridgepole is straight, nothing will be irregular below;  
> When the father is strict, the Way will be formed.  
> Let him not provoke his children to wrath,  
> And the whole dwelling will be filled with harmony.

It should be quite obvious now that the most important role of the father in the Taiping worldview was moral instruction. Taiping fathers were expected to correct misbehaviour and to instruct their children in proper behaviour, but not in such a way that they caused resentment. So, did Hong Xiuquan do that?

### Was Hong Xiuquan a good Taiping father?

While we don't know a huge amount about Hong Xiuquan's relationships with his children, we do know a decent amount about that with his heir apparent, Hong Tianguifu. Born Hong Tiangui in 1849, he briefly became Heavenly King upon his father's death in 1864, before being executed by the Qing after he was captured during an attempt to escape to Guangdong. Before his execution, however, he was required to write a confession, which, although brief, does give us a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the Taiping palace and of Hong Xiuquan's family life. Excerpting the relevant section, translated for publication in the *North China Herald* in 1865 (with some amendments):

> At the age of nine I had four wives given to me, and I was forbidden access to my mother or sisters. The old Heavenly King composed 'The Ten Poems on Salvation' for me to read. They are all n the reasons for keeping men aloof from women and forbidding intercourse between them. Some of the poems I still remember. I had a yearning for my mother and sisters after I reached my ninth year, and used to take advantage of when the old Heavenly King had business at court to steal a visit with them. The old Heavenly King told me to study religious books and would not allow me to study ancient books [i.e. the classics], which he said were all demonic. I managed, however, to read secretly thirty or more volumes, and still retain some recollection of their subjects and contents. I had never been outside the city gates.

While we do have surviving copies of *Ten Poems on Salvation*, their contents are not much more elaborate than what Hong Tianguifu describes above, and are frankly rather tedious. What is pretty clear from all this is that for his part, Hong Xiuquan *did* fulfil what the Taiping saw as the father's key responsibility: the moral instruction of the child. Practicing as he preached, he did indeed instruct his son in the reading of religious texts and in his particular vision of morals and ethics. However, he arguably failed to 'not provoke his children to wrath', given the very overt acts of rebellion that Tianguifu describes himself as having undertaken. Whether he was a good father or not to Tianguifu is thus perhaps a matter of perspective: in Xiuquan's own mind he was doing his duties as he had prescribed, but from Tianguifu's standpoint, Hong was overbearing at best and draconian at worst, failing in terms of the specifics of how that instruction was supposed to manifest.

Unfortunately, we know little else about Hong's relationships with his other children, particularly his two oldest daughters Tiangui, but this little slice does suggest that, at least with regards to his designated successor, he did take his perceived fatherly responsibilities seriously. Whether this was successful in execution is another matter, although it is perhaps worth noting that Tiangui's rebellion was as much against the beliefs (separation of the sexes and condemnation of the Confucian classics) themselves as it was their proponent.

----- __276.1__ -----2022-03-29 22:19:00+08:00:

Nearly a year ago, I wrote [an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mn9mro/what_did_the_taiping_think_of_judaism_and_islam/gtwprn9/) to a question on Taiping views on Judaism and Islam, which I had a good amount of fun with and so will repost here.

____

> "There is no god but God, and Tai-ping-wang is the brother of Jesus."

This quotation adorns the title page of John Milton Mackie's *Life of Tai-Ping-Wang, Chief of the Chinese Insurrection* (1857), and for anyone familiar with English renditions of the *Shahada* (Muslim declaration of faith), it bears a striking resemblance, perhaps even intentionally on Mackie's part:

> I bear witness that there is no deity but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God.

The origin of the quote, however, is hard to pin down as Mackie does not cite any particular text, and I don't know anywhere near enough about Anglophone writing on Islam at this time to say whether there was any conscious attempt at allusion. But, there is little need to speculate on the motives of an American commentator who never went to China, and whose interest in the Taiping seems to have been a temporary affectation in a career otherwise focussed on German literature. If nothing else it's a neat detail, and does get those mental gears turning as to how the Taiping related to the other major Abrahamic faiths.

Now, the question as phrased is Judaism and then Islam, but given my lead-in I suppose I'll have to do it the other way around. The Taiping relationship with Islam is generally poorly attested. In the surviving corpus of texts by Taiping authors, Islam or Muslims appear a grand total of three times, and there is a single throwaway reference in a British report from 1859. However, few as these references are, we can mine quite a bit of information out of them.

Reverend Alexander Wylie, a British Protestant missionary and translator, visited Taiping territory as part of an informal British delegation in 1858, and reported on scenes of desolation and devastation owing to the ongoing war between the Taiping and Qing. Wylie was apparently interested to see what had become of the Catholic churches in the Yangtze valley, which French missionaries had reported the effective dissolution of back in 1853. He reported as follows in a letter published in July 1859 and probably written around January:

> There was no appearance of the existence of Roman Catholicism, but I found Mohammedan mosques still standing among the ruins at Chin-keang [Zhenjiang] and Nanking [Nanjing], and one demolished at Teih-keang [?Dijiang?].

With no further elaboration, all we have to go on is that the Taiping generally, but evidently not consistently, left Muslim places of worship as is, and generally, but not consistently, avoided persecuting Muslims in their territory. But this raises some interesting questions, the most important of which is, of course: *Why* were the Taiping not as concerned about Islam (at least up to 1858), when they were opposed to just about every other religious tradition, and did, even if by mistake, persecute Catholics?

A likely explanation, though a necessarily speculative one thanks to the paucity of primary evidence, is that Islam was not practiced by Han Chinese. Islam was the only major religion in the Qing Empire with a very specifically ethnic tie, with the Islam-practicing Hui being considered a distinct ethnicity from the majority Han. The definition of 'Hui' certainly changed over time, shifting from being mainly used for Muslims in Qing Turkestan, to any Muslims in the empire, to specific groups of Muslims (some Turcophone, some Sinophone) outside of Qing Turkestan, but it was nevertheless a marker of ethnic identity emerging largely out of religious background. Conversion to and from Islam was neither common nor expected, and so the two groups would remain distinct. As such, Islam may not have been considered a 'corruptive' force towards Han Chinese in the same way as Buddhism or Confucianism, or indeed for a brief while Catholicism (before the Taiping came to recognise their common origin).

Later in 1859, Hong Rengan, a cousin of the Taiping monarch Hong Xiuquan, arrived in Nanjing after a stint in Hong Kong as an apprentice translator for Protestant missionaries, and wrote a reform manifesto titled the *New Treatise on Aids in Administration* (資政新篇 *zizheng xinpian*). One of its sections, 'On the Rule of Law', advocates at one point for a move towards regularising foreign relations on equitable lines, as part of which Hong Rengan seems to have begun writing about the customs of foreign countries in order to explain the proper etiquette for each of them, but after the first entry he largely opts to describe their admirable and/or condemnable features to serve as either positive or negative exemplars for the Taiping kingdom. As part of this, he comes to describe three majority-Muslim regions, those being the Ottoman Empire, Iran (then ruled by the Qajars), and the Eyalet of Egypt:

> Turkey, in the southwestern part of which lies the ancient state of Israel, borders Russia on its northwest. As the people of this country do not believe that Jesus Christ is the Saviour, they still cling to the Mosaic Law, without change or modification. Hence, the country is not strong. [In the year 1856], it was invaded by the Russians and was rescued from catastrophe through the assistance rendered by England and France. This country, being the sacred place where the Heavenly Elder Brother was born, must eventually be converted to Christianity, for it is said in the New Testament that when the ten thousand nations of the world have been converted to the faith, Israel will be ashamed.

> [two other sections]

> Persia lies to the southeast of Israel. The Persians worship one of God’s creations, namely, the sun. They do not eat dogs or pigs and they believe in the demon Buddha. At present, though they are called Persians, their land is in reality under foreign domination, of which they are not ashamed. They seek only after wealth and power, never fighting for honour; hence they wander about, moving around with outers, without the slightest sense of loyalty or discipline. They resemble the Chinese of today who have no sense of shame under the domination of the Manchus. This is so because each is concerned only with his own welfare and has no means of achieving unity.

> Egypt, also known as Masri, is situated to the southwest of Israel, with the Red Sea as its boundary. In this place there is no cold in the entire year, and it is extremely hot in the summers. There is a mountain called Ya-la-pe, which is the highest in the world. It was on this mountain that Noah’s Ark was anchored. It is covered with clouds during all four seasons, and its summit is rarely seen. The Egyptians have never seen rain or snow, nor have they ever heard the sound of thunder. In this land there are few springs, but there is much desert. During the time between spring and summer, clouds gather atop the mountain, and waterfalls race down in all directions. Just before the water recedes, the farmers sow their seeds in the fields; by the time the water subsides, the sprouts are growing luxuriantly. This is so because the mountain is high and reaches the clouds, and the ascending hot air freezes on the mountain peak without ever evaporating. Consequently, rain does not fall upon the wilderness, thunder does not clap on the earth, ice forms constantly on the high summit, and snow never flutters over the warm ground. At present, the people there worship Joseph and Moses as their sages, and their religion is called Islam [*Huihui jiao*], for our Heavenly Father, God, once displayed his power to these two men, and their virtues have remained known to this day. 

As can be seen, Hong Rengan only explicitly identifies the Egyptians as Muslims, although it's possible to backtrack a bit and say that he implies the Turks were, too, if the criterion was the importance of Joseph and Moses. Muhammad is of course absent from his description of Islam. It is interesting that the assessment of Islam is not *wholly* negative. On the one hand, he is critical of the Turks for following the Mosaic Law but not also the New Testament, and clearly advocates for Christian proselytisation in the region. On the other hand, at least in terms of tone, his view of the Egyptians' reverence of Joseph and Moses seems reasonably favourable. The section on Persia seems completely off religion-wise, but could well be based on first- or second-hand encounters with Zoroastrian Parsis in Hong Kong – [see this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mklhxj/what_is_the_history_of_chinas_relationship_with/gtnkgu5/) which I had with /u/Xuande88.

Obviously we cannot extrapolate Hong Rengan's writings too far: he was, after all, just one person, and moreover he was one person who had rejoined the fold relatively recently and had not been present for developments in Taiping ideology in his absence. However, Hong's more global view of Christianity does seem to have filtered into the wider Taiping leadership, so we could surmise that there was some heightened awareness of Islam as a global religion, but without much actual understanding of the religion itself.

----- __276.2__ -----2022-03-29 22:19:22+08:00:



The last reference we have to the Taiping and Islam – in a Taiping or Western source, anyway – is in fact right near the end of the last Taiping document, the confession of Lai Wenguang, a general who escaped the fall of the kingdom in 1864 and led a mixed force of Taiping veterans and Nian rebels in northern China, nearly capturing Beijing in 1866. His fortunes faded rapidly, and he was captured in January 1868, writing a brief confession before his execution in which he stated:

> ...in the autumn of *bingyin*, the sixteenth year [i.e., 1866 – the sixteenth year since the founding of the Heavenly Kingdom in 1851], I specially ordered the Liang Wang, Zhang Zongyu, the Young Wu Wang, Zhang Yuque, and the Huai Wang, Qiu Yuancai, to advance to Gansu and Shaanxi and make an alliance with the Muslims for the purpose of mutual assistance. But Heaven did not protect me, and I arrived at my present state. What more can I say?

As with Hong Rengan, Lai was only one person, but it does seem, from the way he frames his confession, that he did see himself as continuing the Taiping war effort, retaining the use of the Taiping year number and of Taiping titles for his subordinates (although it seems that at least Zhang Zongyu's was in fact self-assigned). Whether he believed an alliance was viable for religious or purely pragmatic reasons is of course not stated, but it is perhaps worth noting that the Taiping did actually help kick off the Muslim rebellions in the northwest. When detachments of Shi Dakai's expeditionary force arrived in the Gansu borderlands in 1862, communities across the religious divide armed themselves in anticipation, and the Muslim militias may have sought to ally with the Taiping against their local non-Muslim rivals. It would have been reasonable, therefore, for Lai to expect at least some Muslim groups to be amenable to allying with the Taiping survivors. 

Moreover, other accounts, though not from Taiping writers, show that there was active cooperation between Muslim and Taiping forces well before 1866, and this cooperation involved Lai himself. Lai had ended up in the north as part of a failed Taiping-Nian expedition towards Beijing that was supposed to be led by Chen Yucheng in early 1862, but which had more or less failed before it started when Chen and his retinue were besieged at Luzhou. The other Taiping generals pressed on regardless, and were supported by several points by Muslim forces from Yunnan under Lan Dashun and Lan Ershun, which had originally attempted to link with the Taiping renegade Shi Dakai under orders from the Yunnanese rebel ruler Du Wenxiu.

Our understanding of Taiping-Muslim cooperation during the lifetime of the kingdom itself, however, is complicated somewhat by an earlier confession by Li Xiucheng, the old Taiping commander-in-chief, who, at the time of his execution in July 1864, denied that there was any contact between the Taiping and the Muslim rebels of Yunnan, Gansu and Shaanxi. The information need not contradict the above: the Yunnanese were mainly interested in Shi Dakai, who had gone rogue in 1858, while Lai Wenguang's survivors were seeking out the Gansu and Shaanxi rebels some two years after Li Xiucheng's death. But the fact that the Yunnanese sought out the Taiping, and that Lai only sought refuge in Shaanxi in desperation, suggests that the Taiping were, by and large, not approaching the Muslim rebels as natural allies.

The material for Judaism is simultaneously more extensive and more scant than for Islam, depending on how you want to approach it. We could talk endlessly about Biblical Hebrews and Jews, as the Taiping obviously held the Old Testament as one of their three principal canons (the others being the New Testament and the Taiping's own textual corpus), and like most conventional Protestants they were perfectly willing to accept the conceit that Jews pre-Christ were theologically valid and God's chosen people. Indeed, one of the earliest Taiping texts to adapt Biblical scripture, the *Three-Character Classic* (1853), includes a lengthy section on the Plagues of Egypt and the Exodus, which if read in a metaphorical sense can be understood as analogous to the Taiping: God sent Moses to inflict the plagues upon the Egyptians and liberate his chosen people, the Hebrews; God has sent Hong Xiuquan to inflict punishment upon the Manchus and liberate his chosen people, the Han.

But when it comes to contemporary Jews, the Taiping really say very little, which is perhaps unsurprising: the only significant Jewish population in China was an enclave a couple of hundred strong in Kaifeng (which still exists today), the surviving sources for which have always been patchy. We know that the Taiping captured Kaifeng for a time in 1857, which (as was often the case in the Taiping War) led to severe damage by the time the Qing retook it, and we know that the synagogue, which was in disrepair by 1850, had clearly been demolished by 1866. It is unclear if this was due to Taiping action, but the reports from the Kaifeng Jews themselves, limited and often vague as they were, suggest that it was likely a natural result of the state of disrepair not only of the structure but indeed of the community writ large, rather than any intentional act of destruction by an outside party.

No Taiping sources survive for the occupation of Kaifeng which detail their position with regards to the Jewish population, but there is one(!) source that does, if briefly, mention the Kaifeng enclave, and it is, surprise, surprise, Hong Rengan in the *New Treatise on Aids in Administration*. Immediately following on from the section on the Ottoman Empire, he writes:

> The Jews, forty years after Jesus Christ’s ascent to heaven, were angrily punished by God and driven out of Israel; those who believed in Jesus Christ also escaped to other countries. That there are now Jews in every country is proof and evidence of this, and it is also the will of our Heavenly Father. In China for example, there are many Jewish people in Xiangfu *xian* of Kaifeng prefecture, Henan, with their sheepskin books on which Hebrew words are written. But these people, from Song to the present day, in the space of many years, have merely observed the rituals without knowing the words or the real meaning. When asked why they follow their religion, their answer is that they are hoping for the birth of Christ the Saviour. Jews of other countries are also like this; they do not believe that the Saviour was born 1,859 years ago.

This is pretty conventional stuff for someone instructed by Protestant missionaries, especially the notion of Jews being ignorant of the arrival of the Saviour. Its rather critical view of the Kaifeng Jewish community is in accord with other contemporary sources: letters by the Jews themselves and by Christian visitors to the city show that the community was very much in decline, with virtually nobody still literate in Hebrew since the death of the last rabbi some fifty years earlier. It is still unfortunate and inconvenient for our purposes that Hong Rengan says nothing of what might be done, nor does he make any reference to the earlier Taiping attack and its implications.

So that's a lot about individual texts and their implications, now let's pull it all together. The Taiping, or at least some among them, were clearly cognisant of the status of Judaism and Islam as fellow Abrahamic monotheistic faiths. Insofar as we have any assessment of what they thought of the religions as practiced (which comes entirely from Hong Rengan), they seem to have been relatively ambivalent, appreciating that they did have a common recognition of the Old Testament, but seeing their own religion as more advanced and closer to God's intentions. Possibly for reasons of ethnic nationalism, the Taiping generally made no effort to deliberately destroy places of worship, at least for Islam – the destruction of the Dijiang mosque may have been an outlier or the result of collateral damage, while there is no explicit causal link between the Taiping capture of Kaifeng and the destruction of its synagogue, which could have been at any point between 1852 and 1866. And, the Taiping were very much willing to work with Muslim military allies, but this was largely for pragmatic reasons. So, not a wholehearted embrace as coreligionists, but also not a zealous objection to all deviations from the Taiping faith.

To be honest, only Gen 3 and EN have been explicitly themed (and even then, pirates aren't 'fantasy' as such). HoloX does have the secret society schtick but arguably that only serves as a lore backstory for 5 members who would, without it, be pretty different (Iroha especially stands out a bit lore-wise). So it's not that ID is the exception, but that EN is.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

Nope, just doesn't exist. Miko originally debuted under Cover but outside Hololive in August 2018, and then got moved into Hololive at the end of the year. I'm not 100% on why Miko debuted as 3D although given timescales etc. (Mel debuted in May and Gen 1 in June 2018) I would imagine she was being worked on before Hololive pivoted to Live2D.

This question has been removed because it is [soapboxing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or otherwise a [loaded question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/): it has the effect of promoting an existing interpretation or opinion at the expense of open-ended enquiry. Although we understand if you may have an existing interest in the topic, expressing a detailed opinion on the matter in your question is usually a sign that it is a loaded one, and we will remove questions that appear to put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.

### 288: [What would you say is the best Roman Emperor?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tscxe8/what_would_you_say_is_the_best_roman_emperor/), submitted on 2022-03-31 02:25:28+08:00.

----- __288.1__ -----2022-03-31 02:29:06+08:00:

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).
