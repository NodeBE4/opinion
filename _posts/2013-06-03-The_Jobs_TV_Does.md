    This is Part 3 of a three-part series on what changes, if any, may be coming to TV
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   TV, as I have recounted in the last two articles, is as firmly entrenched as an incumbent can be.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The idea that you can cut the cord and simply watch the shows you currently want to watch (unbundling) is a fantasy; the economics that make those shows possible depend on the current pay-TV model (See Part 1:
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/the-cord-cutting-fantasy/">
     The Cord-Cutting Fantasy
    </a>
    )
   </li>
   <li>
    Great content has few substitutes, high barriers of entry, and depends on networks as de facto venture capitalists willing to take risks on new shows (See Part 2:
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/why-tv-has-resisted-disruption/">
     Why TV Has Resisted Disruption
    </a>
    )
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Competing with this model has, and will continue to, fail. There is no
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/steve-jobs-on-television/">
    go-to-market strategy
   </a>
   that is feasible.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, the only way things will change is through
   <em>
    true
   </em>
   disruption.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disruption is a funny word; in most of the tech press, it has come to mean little more than “competitive,” and functionally superior products are often labeled as “disruptive.”
  </p>
  <p>
   This is precisely backwards; a disruptive product is
   <em>
    inferior
   </em>
   to the incumbent, and usually relies on a completely different business model (usually a lower margin one). A disruptive product is almost always cheaper, and in fact usually doesn’t
   <em>
    seem
   </em>
   competitive at all, at least in the beginning.
   <a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" href="#footnote_0_368" id="identifier_0_368" title="You could get far with the assumption that anything the blogosphere calls disruptive, isn’t. It’s simply competitive">
    1
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Competitive (or “sustaining”) products simply try to provide the same
   <em>
    function
   </em>
   but better. TIVO is a classic example in this space; TIVO’s competitive proposition is that it is a
   <em>
    better
   </em>
   set top box than the one you get from your cable company:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Both the set top box from your cable company (STBFYCC) and the TIVO change channels
   </li>
   <li>
    Both the STBFYCC and the TIVO display a channel guide
   </li>
   <li>
    Both the STBFYCC and the TIVO pause live TV
   </li>
   <li>
    Both the STBFYCC and the TIVO record shows to watch later
   </li>
   <li>
    Both the STBFYCC and the TIVO can be programmed to record a specific show
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The TIVO does a lot more, and does it better, but the differentiation is at the margins. It is a sustaining product, and has serious limitations: getting cable cards is a pain, and the upfront cost is significant relative to STBFYCC. I have no doubt Apple, say, could create a set top box even better than a TIVO; I also have no doubt that it would suffer the same fate.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, if a better set-top box is doomed, what might disrupt TV?
  </p>
  <p>
   The theory of disruption rests on the idea of “jobs to be done.”
   <a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" href="#footnote_1_368" id="identifier_1_368" title="For more on jobs-to-done, check out this article on the Facebook Phone">

   </a>
   TIVO does the same job as a set top box; but – and this is the crucial point – the set top box is only a means to an end. What is the
   <strong>
    job
   </strong>
   we hire TV to do?
  </p>
  <p>
   It turns out there are quite a few. Some of the jobs TV has traditionally done include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Keep us informed
   </li>
   <li>
    Educate
   </li>
   <li>
    Give a live view of sporting events
   </li>
   <li>
    Enlighten and story-tell
   </li>
   <li>
    Provide escapism
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   For decades TV was better at each of these jobs than anything else in consumers’ lives. It was in this period of superiority that the present economic system of pay-TV was developed, and, in a world where so many jobs were done by one device, any price was a great deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s in jobs-to-be-done, however, where the unbundling that matters is happening. “Keep us informed” is the obvious one: the idea of relying on TV news is so archaic to most of you that I know I raised your hackles by even putting it in that list. Same thing with “educate” – one can learn far more from the web than even the best TV.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words, two of the jobs TV has traditionally done are now done far better, and far more cheaply, by personal devices like computers, tablets, and phones. That is disruption.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet, we pay more than ever for TV; the vast majority of the population gives enough of their attention to some combination of sports, story-telling and escapism to sustain the current model.
  </p>
  <p>
   It’s attention that is key; our attention is a zero sum resource – every minute I spend playing a game, for example, is a minute I don’t spend watching TV. And, if any company “cracks” TV, it’s not that they’ve figured out how to do TV better, but that they’ve figured out how to win a greater and greater share of consumer’s
   <em>
    attention
   </em>
   by doing the same
   <strong>
    jobs
   </strong>
   that TV does, but better.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   TV is so entrenched because it’s actually cheap for what you get, it benefits from tremendous network effects, and it’s a default choice for most people. In fact, its entrenchment is not unlike the entrenchment of the PC, which ruled the roost for 25 years: cheap for what you get, tremendous network effects, and Windows was the default choice.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultimately, what disrupted the PC was
   <strong>
    not
   </strong>
   a competitive product; even today Windows still has &gt;90% share of PCs. However, Windows commands an ever dwindling share of the time spent on all devices; phones and tablets have taken away
   <em>
    attention
   </em>
   because they do many of the jobs we previously hired PCs to do – read, draw, music, video, games – better.
  </p>
  <p>
   The disruption of TV will follow a similar path: a different category will provide better live sports, better story-telling, or better escapism. Said category will steal
   <em>
    attention
   </em>
   , and when TV no longer commands enough attention of enough people, the entire edifice will collapse. Suddenly.
  </p>
  <p>
   I’d bet on escapism being the next job we give to something else, for a few reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The economics of live sports are completely intertwined with the pay-TV model; this will be the last pillar to crumble
   </li>
   <li>
    Networks still play a crucial role in providing “venture-funding” for great story-telling. Netflix is the great hope here
   </li>
   <li>
    Escapism is in some sense indiscriminate; it doesn’t matter how our mind escapes, as long as it does. Yet it’s also highly personal; the more tailored the escape, the more fulfilling. This is why there are hundreds of TV channels. However, there will never be as many TV channels as there are apps.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Imagine a $99

   </a>
   “console” with an optional $49 controller and an App Store.

   </a>
   That’s a lot of potential escapism, and a lot of user attention. It’s a lot of margin too, at least at high volumes. I think it’s a space where a company that thinks different could have a “
   <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/17/the-cook-doctrine/">
    a significant contribution
