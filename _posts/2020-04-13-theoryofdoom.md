Essentially every aspect of your comment is unavailing. In addition to your failure to cite a single source supporting your incorrect interpretation of the meaning of "arsenokoitai," that term is (a) not the only word that was subsequently, and incorrectly, translated to refer to "homosexual," as there were many words in both the old and new testaments which were wrongly mistranslated as such, during the 19th century; (b) Greek (modern or ancient) was not the only language so translated; (c) to the extent that word appears in limited contexts, "arsenokoitai" does not mean "men who have sexual relations with men," as you have incorrectly claimed; (d) the word "arsenokoitai" does not mean "homosexual," as you have incorrectly claimed; and (e) the modern English simplifications from the 17th century KJV, such as the NIV, fail to capture the particular actions referenced in Romans, Leviticus, etc. that were actually being referenced.
