### 612: [Historically, what types of activities or movements have been able to counter a slide towards authoritarianism?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/w1q1ps/historically_what_types_of_activities_or/), submitted on 2022-07-18 12:09:24+08:00.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 615: [How did "dispose" semantically shift from "put apart" 🡺 to "transfer title to property"?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/w1sm7y/how_did_dispose_semantically_shift_from_put_apart/), submitted on 2022-07-18 14:45:30+08:00.

Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to /r/linguistics.

If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.

### 616: [Cacophanous Copium Congregation - Weekly Discussion Thread, 18th July, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/w2234d/cacophanous_copium_congregation_weekly_discussion/), submitted on 2022-07-18 23:25:07+08:00.

----- __616.1__ -----2022-07-20 23:00:16+08:00:

> Not vTuber related

To be fair, the video does feature both Ironmouse and [Scarlett Rainn](https://scarlettrainn.carrd.co/) so it kinda is.

----- __616.2__ -----2022-07-21 12:16:17+08:00:

I believe she will be collabing with Nene at one point; the original time didn't work out but there was a rescheduling planned.

----- __616.3__ -----2022-07-22 00:44:02+08:00:

...Wasn't that in the free portion though?

----- __616.4__ -----2022-07-22 00:53:21+08:00:

There's a difference between '$50 for 3rd Fes wasn't worth it' and 'I felt like I got more out of the $50 I paid for Calli's concert than the $50 I paid for each day of 3rd Fes', and it's one which you've clearly said you're in the former camp on. For my part, I did enjoy 3rd Fes and thought it was worth the price of admission, but Calli's concert was definitely *more* worth the price. Which is weird to say given that Calli's concert had 24 songs, while 3rd Fes had 28 and 26 respectively, while also being considerably lower-tech in some regards, but I imagine it was a mix of:

* Calli being my oshi, 24 Calli songs is a lot more enticing than 26/8 songs of which maybe half to two thirds feature a member I actively follow;

* The songs were much more densely packed with no MC segments, so it *felt* like more was going on;

* It was a bit more of an intimate atmosphere even in the livestream, with a much more substantial 'vibe' to it;

* Because it was Calli throughout, there was a sort of continuity of atmosphere to it across songs without it being broken up into individual members' sections;

* The producers really must have had fun doing new visual effects for every single song;

* It's Calli. Everything is a banger. Even the shitposts? Especially the shitposts.

----- __616.5__ -----2022-07-22 01:02:35+08:00:

No, she isn't, just hijacking a human body for a bit.

----- __616.6__ -----2022-07-22 01:21:19+08:00:

...It was Nijisanji that shuttered its KR and IN branches, not Hololive.

----- __616.7__ -----2022-07-22 01:23:40+08:00:

> the AR tech there was actually quite a bit more impressive than Calli's concert

Might be because Calli's concert didn't include the AR, but did do more visual effects for stream viewers.

----- __616.8__ -----2022-07-22 01:28:11+08:00:

Ah, I'd known about the former but not the latter. That said, who knows at this stage?

----- __616.9__ -----2022-07-22 08:07:45+08:00:

ah fair, I don't use USD on the regular anyway so IDK the Yen exchange rates.

----- __616.10__ -----2022-07-22 08:54:03+08:00:

Head of international development or similar IIRC.

----- __616.11__ -----2022-07-22 08:55:57+08:00:

I've had this with Izzzyzzz and Josh Strife Hayes recently, despite having very little exposure to late 2000s/early 2010s girl-oriented tween media or MMOs, respectively. They're just oddly engaging about their subject matter.

----- __616.12__ -----2022-07-22 08:59:11+08:00:

I said this when the trailer first dropped, but I wonder why some members' names are the wrong way round here.

----- __616.13__ -----2022-07-22 09:03:24+08:00:

Didn't care enough to check, but did care enough to post.

----- __616.14__ -----2022-07-22 09:10:39+08:00:

The announcements at the start said no cheering. By about the midpoint that rule started to be broken. By the end it seemed like 'rules? what rules?'

----- __616.15__ -----2022-07-22 09:11:20+08:00:

'Rui' is correct to how it's spelled in katakana, to be fair.

----- __616.16__ -----2022-07-22 09:22:06+08:00:

> Bae with Miori Celesta

I'm honestly (pleasantly) surprised that went ahead, not because Miori is particularly controversial but more because of Bae's past funnily enough.

----- __616.17__ -----2022-07-22 09:27:39+08:00:

> Nijisanji's chinese fanbase only became a thing after the guys debuted.

I mean Nijisanji has straight up had a CN branch for years. NijiEN's fanbase on the other hand, that's a different story.

----- __616.18__ -----2022-07-22 14:47:11+08:00:

Update: it's not; that's coming in December (whatever it is).

----- __616.19__ -----2022-07-22 19:58:44+08:00:

Hololive has come to accept that all its 5-member generations are going to lose one member and are pre-empting it in the lore material for Tempus.

----- __616.20__ -----2022-07-23 15:11:59+08:00:

I'm not crying you're crying

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 626: [[Baelz] Calli bypassed the middleman](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/w4esjh/baelz_calli_bypassed_the_middleman/), submitted on 2022-07-21 19:54:51+08:00.

----- __626.1__ -----2022-07-21 23:53:01+08:00:

> For context, she 24 songs with almost no breaks. Then the encore section began and she went twice as hard as before.
> 
> 

Correction, she sang 18 and then did a 6-song encore section.

----- __626.2__ -----2022-07-22 08:41:20+08:00:

When I last counted in late April she had 34 original songs, but you've made me count again because that was a while ago and now I may as well post her entire orisong list somewhere for reference. Now, the Virtual Youtuber Wiki lists the following 20:

* RIP
* ReaperかRapper? 自己紹介ラップ
* Dead Beats
* Live Again
* Cursed Night
* Off with their Heads
* Ibasho
* Red
* Grim Reaper is a Live Streamer
* Bully
* Guh
* Dawn Blue
* End of a Life
* UnAlive
* Dead on Arrival
* Lose-Lose Days
* Huge W
* Resting Power
* Scuffed Up Age
* Ouroboros

However, that doesn't include collab originals, the C-Man EP, or her new 6-song EP. If we *do* include those then we add:

* Spiral Tones (With Rikka)
* Cloudy Sheep (With Watame)
* Myth or Treat (Myth)
* Crown (With Boogey Voxx)
* Graveyard Shift (With Boogey Voxx)
* Yona Yona Journey (With Taku Inoue)
* Q (With Gura)
* Wicked (With Suisei)
* Journey like a Thousand Years (Myth)
* CapSule (With Suisei)
* C-Man 
* Street Fite (With Hayko)
* My Reality
* Money (Hand me the Glock)
* Mera Mera
* Villain Vibes (With AmaLee/Monarch)
* Holy嫉妬
* Make 'Em Afraid
* Kamouflage
* Let's End the World

So that doubles her orisong count from what the list says, with a further 12 collab and 8 solo originals – albeit with C-Man accounting for 1 and 3 of these, respectively. It would honestly be easier to say which orisongs she *didn't* do out of those 40 than the 23 she did do (there was a new orisong with Watame). Doing some quick back-of-the-envelope maths, of her 40 total songs, it would have been *possible* to do 29 (28 solo + 1 with Gura + 2 with Suisei + 1 with Watame - 3 done as C-Man) as part of this particular concert.

Speaking of, if you do want a setlist read on and see below:

1. Guh
2. Holy嫉妬
3. Kamouflage
4. Dead on Arrival
5. Red
6. Q (w. Gura)
7. Grim Reaper is a Live-Streamer
8. CapSule (w. Suisei)
9. Wicked (w. Suisei)
10. New Orisong (w. Watame)
11. Cloudy Sheep (w. Watame)
12. Bully
13. UnAlive
14. Dawn Blue
15. Lose-Lose Days
16. Scuffed-Up Age
17. Live Again
18. End of a Life
19. Make 'Em Afraid
20. Dead Beats
21. Mera Mera
22. Huge W
23. Let's End The World
24. R.I.P.

Which means the 6 theoretically could done but didn't were:

* ReaperかRapper? 自己紹介ラップ
* Cursed Night
* Off with their Heads
* Ibasho
* Resting Power
* Ouroboros

Obviously, she wouldn't have been able to do any collab originals where the collab partner wasn't there, and was supremely unlikely to do any of the C-Man releases as part of her set.

Going by colloquial definitions of the two polities, 'Korea' and 'China' have a shared history stretching back many centuries, and it would be difficult to cover it all in a single post.

Oh my god, you scooped me! I've been sitting on a half-started writeup for months! Hats off to you, sir. That said, I feel like I need to issue a correction or two:

> About a year later, in January of 2017 Martin moved to a studio in France, and posted his first video showcasing his plans for a new marble machine - called the Marble Machine X (or MMX), a robust, reliable machine which he could take on a world tour.

Martin actually operated out of two workshops in Sweden for the majority of 2017, before moving to France in November.

er

That's it. Well done.

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

Do I know of some? Yes. Would I recommend them? No. With one exception. *China: A New History, Second Enlarged Edition*, originally by the late John Fairbank (completed just before his death in 1991) and amended by Merle Goldman, is about the only broad overview history of China that I would consider reasonably academically solid, and even that has caveats given the relative age of the original manuscript before Goldman's revision and expansion for the second edition (2006). Arguably a more comprehensive and up-to-date overview would require doing a bit more reading with individual specialists in particular periods – my personal recommendation would be a run of seven books, consisting of the *History of Imperial China* series by Mark Edward Lewis, Dieter Kühn, Timothy Brook, and William T. Rowe, followed up with Jonathan Spence's *The Search for Modern China* (specifically the 2012 third edition), or Pamela Crossley's *The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800, An Interpretive History*.
