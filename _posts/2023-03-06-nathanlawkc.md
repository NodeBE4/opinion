So rare that Xi speaks in these terms, even in a more private setting with party media. <br>The CCP's getting more aggressive in 3rd term of Xi.<br><br>Chinese leader blames Washington-led ‘containment, encirclement and suppression’ for severe challenges at home https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-xi-jinping-takes-rare-direct-aim-at-u-s-in-speech-5d8fde1a

Re It's not difficult to understand -- the potential war on Taiwan is at the crux of Xi's narrative about the revival of the race. They need to lay a firmer ground to support the narratives.<br>Even though the Ukraine war diminishes the possibility, CCP has to be seen as preparing war.

Hollywood is a gold-digging industry, and has been trying to please CCP. Actors like Richard Gere got canceled for criticizing China's aggression in Tibet. They self-censor yet claim to represent equality and liberty.<br>They should act to show their values.<br>https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7ejeq/donnie-yen-oscars-petition-hong-kong-protests

Re Maybe she wanted to visit her husband, at the risk of  years of imprisonment.<br><br>According to @HKDC, Hong Kong has one of the highest proportions of female political prisoners, and a marriage with activists Beijing does not like could also be a crime. A new reality of our city.

Re @yuenpauwoo Opposed the Uyghur Genocide bill, supported Beijing's Winter Olympics, and claimed that China has a "legitimate" legal system.<br>Now this ridiculous comparison.<br>Time will tell now who needs to register as a foreign agent.<br>#CCP
