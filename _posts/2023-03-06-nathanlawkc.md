So rare that Xi speaks in these terms, even in a more private setting with party media. <br>The CCP's getting more aggressive in 3rd term of Xi.<br><br>Chinese leader blames Washington-led ‘containment, encirclement and suppression’ for severe challenges at home https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-xi-jinping-takes-rare-direct-aim-at-u-s-in-speech-5d8fde1a

Re It's not difficult to understand -- the potential war on Taiwan is at the crux of Xi's narrative about the revival of the race. They need to lay a firmer ground to support the narratives.<br>Even though the Ukraine war diminishes the possibility, CCP has to be seen as preparing war.

Hollywood is a gold-digging industry, and has been trying to please CCP. Actors like Richard Gere got canceled for criticizing China's aggression in Tibet. They self-censor yet claim to represent equality and liberty.<br>They should act to show their values.<br>https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7ejeq/donnie-yen-oscars-petition-hong-kong-protests

On the next day of intl’ women’s day, Tang, wife of Lee, both were labor union veterans in Hong Kong, was arrested outside of the prison where her husband is jailed. <br>She left in 2021 because warnings of her safety emerged. But she went back, for now we’re not sure why. https://t.co/83jYXK0sCR<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqxsAvrXwAE7fzI?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
