### 729: [Magical Michelada Mondays - Weekly Discussion Thread, August 22nd, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wuw70t/magical_michelada_mondays_weekly_discussion/), submitted on 2022-08-22 23:10:16+08:00.

> expressed an interest in learning Chinese

I feel like every time someone says 'Chinese' as though it's a single language I have to call it out.

----- __729.2__ -----2022-08-23 10:41:19+08:00:

In EN at least. I don't think she comes close to even 5% of ID's ability to call chat out on its bullshit.

----- __729.3__ -----2022-08-23 10:47:05+08:00:

Every language is significant to whoever speaks it. And there's plenty you haven't mentioned – Taishanese is a Yue language with very low mutual intelligibility with Cantonese and 3m+ speakers, some 44m+ speak Hakka varieties, there's the Gan languages in Jiangxi, etc.

----- __729.4__ -----2022-08-23 10:57:43+08:00:

Nope, not mutually intelligible (I speak from experience).

----- __729.5__ -----2022-08-23 11:07:35+08:00:

I feel we were spoiled by Myth getting theirs 9ish months in.

----- __729.6__ -----2022-08-23 12:34:25+08:00:

To be fair, no, but I speak as someone who speaks a non-Mandarin Sinitic language. Plus, Spanish and Italian dialects are, on the whole, far more mutually intelligible than Sinitic languages are. It's less 'using "Spanish" as a catch-all for all Iberian languages' and more 'using "German" to also refer to Dutch and Swedish'.

----- __729.7__ -----2022-08-23 13:09:45+08:00:

I didn't say 'actually mutually intelligible', I said *more* mutually intelligible. At least with Italian dialects you might pick up a word or two.

----- __729.8__ -----2022-08-23 13:10:04+08:00:

Basque is a language isolate though, it isn't even Indo-European.

Hi! Thanks for your submission to r/HobbyDrama.

Unfortunately, we have had to remove your post for violating Rule 9:

> Consequences of the drama must be detailed beyond "...and everyone was mad"

This would be suited to Scuffles, but not to being a top-level post.
