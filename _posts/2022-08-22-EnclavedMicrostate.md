### 729: [Mindless Monday, 22 August 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/wuqith/mindless_monday_22_august_2022/), submitted on 2022-08-22 19:00:11+08:00.

----- __729.1__ -----2022-08-24 22:40:54+08:00:

I tend to use Pamela Crossley's terminology of 'Taiping War', if for no other reason than that 'Taiping Civil War' may end up inadvertently misleading. An issue I sort of have – a bit ironic as a Taiping specialist – is that the conflict often gets seen in isolation when it wasn't even the only domestic conflict in the Qing Empire at the time. The Yunnanese revolt of 1856-73 is supposed to have accounted for at least 2 million dead and continues to have a considerable place in the cultural memory of the Muslim communities of southwest China, while the 'Dungan' rebellion in Gansu and Shaanxi in 1862-75 is alleged to have reduced those provinces' population by a combined total of 20 million (though this doesn't distinguish between deaths and displacements). Tallying up death tolls is neither particularly straightforward nor productive, but speaking in purely estimatory terms I wouldn't be surprised if fewer than half of war-related deaths in the Qing Empire between 1850 and 1880 can be specifically attributed to the Taiping conflict.

In broader terms, I feel like 'Qing Civil War' is a valid descriptor for the broad period of conflict within the Qing Empire from 1850 through 1878, of which the Taiping War was the materially largest part. There just isn't really enough consideration of these as interconnected conflicts, and I suspect that relates to the continuing lack of a good framing narrative of *Qing* history in this period. There's a lot of individual, focussed studies, but nothing as yet that tries to really analyse the empire as a singular system.

I feel like every time someone says 'Chinese' as though it's a single language I have to call it out.

----- __730.3__ -----2022-08-23 10:47:05+08:00:

Every language is significant to whoever speaks it. And there's plenty you haven't mentioned – Taishanese is a Yue language with very low mutual intelligibility with Cantonese and 3m+ speakers, some 44m+ speak Hakka varieties, there's the Gan languages in Jiangxi, etc.

Nope, not mutually intelligible (I speak from experience).

----- __730.6__ -----2022-08-23 12:34:25+08:00:

To be fair, no, but I speak as someone who speaks a non-Mandarin Sinitic language. Plus, Spanish and Italian dialects are, on the whole, far more mutually intelligible than Sinitic languages are. It's less 'using "Spanish" as a catch-all for all Iberian languages' and more 'using "German" to also refer to Dutch and Swedish'.

----- __730.7__ -----2022-08-23 13:09:45+08:00:

I didn't say 'actually mutually intelligible', I said *more* mutually intelligible. At least with Italian dialects you might pick up a word or two.

Basque is a language isolate though, it isn't even Indo-European.

----- __730.9__ -----2022-08-23 19:07:25+08:00:

I'm glad you can universalise your experience based on a country where Mandarin is the dominant Sinitic language, but *I am part of the annoyed minority here* as someone whose language is frequently ignored and increasingly endangered, even if markedly less so than a number of other languages, Sinitic or otherwise.

----- __732.1__ -----2022-08-23 20:27:21+08:00:

It will depend how efficiently you apply yourself. For my part I typically only really 'worked' 8 hours a day, two and a half days a week (four days in terms where I had historiography/approaches papers running in parallel with my main term paper), and came away with a First at the end of it all. But that also entailed having done a certain amount of pre-reading out of term, in conjunction with a lot of informal 'work' in the form of simply spending time thinking things over even after handing something in.

Tanks are armoured vehicles that are expected to be fired on by a lot of stuff and hopefully survive. Self-propelled howitzers are artillery pieces, some of which are armoured to give some measure of protection against enemy artillery fire, but rarely if ever protected enough to survive sustained attack because if it gets to that point, you are having a really bad day.

### 734: [Newest consensus on whether the Ming/Qing China was predominantly an atheist/agnostic civilization?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wvq701/newest_consensus_on_whether_the_mingqing_china/), submitted on 2022-08-23 22:24:49+08:00.

----- __734.1__ -----2022-08-24 11:54:51+08:00:

Not meaningfully, I wouldn't say. The Qing balanced a number of religious worldviews in the construction of their empire, precisely because each of their constituent populations' elites had a particular cosmological outlook. I discuss it in some detail in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/e1q2ft/did_any_of_the_qing_emperors_and_court_advisors/) but feel free to ask any follow-ups.

----- __734.2__ -----2022-08-24 13:30:58+08:00:

I would say all of them are false. That Confucianism, Daoism, Mahayana Buddhism and Chinese folk beliefs do not resemble Abrahamic monotheism does not mean these were atheistic belief systems. All of these religions make cosmological claims, and Confucianism in particular – the guiding ideology of the Han literati – is rooted in the idea that there is an ideal cosmological order defined by adherence to rigid hierarchies, and that it is the role of the ruler and his advisors to bring the world in line with this ideal order. Meanwhile Daoist rites like sacrifices to Mount Tai were not merely shows for the gullible public, but clear demonstrations of commitment to upholding the correct Way of things.

This gets more complicated when Tibetan Buddhism is involved, and your perspective will depend on how cynically you view things like the Qianlong Emperor's patronage of the religion. I will stress that my more cynical perspective is *not the only one*, and that some biographers of the Qianlong Emperor suggest that he was in fact devoutly Buddhist in a way that influenced his views of the other religions of his empire. I don't agree fully, but I find a lot of merit to the suggestion that he did nevertheless sincerely engage with these religions, and fundamentally believed in the existence of *a* cosmic order even if he had to navigate between several specific versions of that fundamental idea. To paraphrase the man's own words, the Chinese, Manchus, and Mongols have different words for Heaven, but they all still have words for Heaven.

### 735: [Is Alexander the Great macedonian or greek?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wvv0t1/is_alexander_the_great_macedonian_or_greek/), submitted on 2022-08-24 01:40:30+08:00.

----- __735.1__ -----2022-08-24 12:57:46+08:00:

I see a couple of answers by /u/Iphikrates have been linked, and I'll just start off by saying I substantively agree with them – the question is not one with a simple binary answer, and the discussion around it is dominated by questions of modern nationalism relating especially to disputes between the modern Hellenic Republic and the Republic of North Macedonia (formerly the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). The angle taken in the linked answers is, I would stress, an entirely valid one, given the way that the question is usually asked. That said, my own view on the subject is that as long as we are very clear that we are confining ourselves to a properly historically contextualised understanding of these identities, then we can and indeed should be able to have a meaningful discussion of Greekness and Macedonianness both in the immediate context of Alexander's campaigns and in the broader context of the classical Alexander historiography that would develop over the next half-millennium.

It is vital to stress that perceptions of Greekness and Macedonianness *did matter greatly in Alexander's day*. This is perhaps most apparent in the histories of events after he died (for reasons that may become apparent later), in which Greco-Macedonian tensions are frequently highlighted. Perhaps the most illustrative case is that of Eumenes of Kardia, a Greek who served as Alexander's personal secretary before taking field command under his appointed successor, Perdikkas. Eumenes' perceived non-Macedonianness was a notable hurdle when it came to his attempts to command Macedonian troops:

> When Alexander was dead​ and a quarrel had arisen between the Macedonian men-at‑war and his principal officers, or companions,​ Eumenes sided with the latter in his opinions, but in what he said he was a kind of common friend to both and held himself aloof from the quarrel, on the ground that it was no business of his, since he was a stranger, to meddle in disputes of Macedonians.

> – Plutarch, *Life of Eumenes* 3.1

> Alcetas, then, flatly refused to serve in the campaign, on the ground that the Macedonians under him were ashamed to fight Antipater, and were so well disposed to Craterus that they were ready to receive him with open arms.

> – *Ibid.* 5.2

> Eumenes, who at this time also kept these things in mind, prudently made his own position secure, for he foresaw that Fortune would change again. He perceived that he himself was a foreigner and had no claim to the royal power, that the Macedonians who were now subject to him had previously decreed his death, and that those who occupied the military commands were filled with arrogance and were aiming at great affairs. He therefore understood that he would soon be despised and at the same time envied, and that his life would eventually be in danger; for no one will willingly carry out orders given by those whom he regards as his inferiors, or be patient when he has over him as masters those who ought themselves to be subject to others.

> – Diodoros 18.60.1

But it was one that could be overcome through a mixture of both general beneficence and specific mobilisations of Macedonian symbols of political legitimacy:

> Moreover, having promised to give his soldiers their pay within three days, he sold them the homesteads and castles about the country, which were full of slaves and flocks. Then every captain in the phalanx or commander of mercenaries who had bought a place was supplied by Eumenes with implements and engines of war and took it by siege; and thus every soldier received the pay that was due him, in a distribution of the captured properties. In consequence of this, Eumenes was again in high favour; and once when letters were found in his camp which the leaders of the enemy had caused to be scattered there, wherein they offered a hundred talents and honours to any one who should kill Eumenes, his Macedonians were highly incensed and made a decree that a thousand of the leading soldiers should serve him continually as a body-guard, watching over him when he went abroad and spending the night at his door.

> – Plutarch, *Eumenes* 8.5-6

> As all agreed to his proposal, everything needed was quickly made ready, for the royal treasure was rich in gold. Straightway then, when a magnificent tent had been set up, the throne was erected, upon which were placed the diadem, the sceptre, and the armour that Alexander had been wont to use. Then when an altar with a fire upon it had been put in place, all the commanders would make sacrifice from a golden casket, presenting frankincense and the most costly of the other kinds of incense and making obeisance to Alexander as to a god. After this those who exercised command would sit in the many chairs that had been placed about and take counsel together, deliberating upon the matters that from time to time required their attention. Eumenes, by placing himself on an equality with the other commanders in all the matters that were discussed and by seeking their favour through the most friendly intercourse, wore down the envy with which he had been regarded and secured for himself a great deal of goodwill among the commanders. 3 As their reverence for the king grew stronger, they were all filled with happy expectations, just as if some god were leading them. And by conducting himself toward the Macedonian Silver Shields in a similar way, Eumenes gained great favour among them as a man worthy of the solicitude of the kings.

> Diodoros 18.61.1-3

Apologies for all the block quotes above, but I want to stress as heavily as possible that perceptions of one's identity could be extremely significant, and that the question of how particular leaders presented themselves – and how far those they were appealing to accepted those presentations – is a valid one to ask. What the case of Eumenes shows is that there was a Macedonian conception of an in-group that did not simply include all Greeks by default: Eumenes had to demonstrate that he was fit to lead Macedonians, but even then never really proved himself to be a Macedonian himself. In turn though, this raises another point: one could claim legitimacy within a particular target population's framework of legitimacy, without claiming to be a member of that population, and still be taken seriously. Alexander mobilised Persian and Egyptian symbols of rulership at the same time that he mobilised Greek and Macedonian ones, without necessarily claiming to have been 'a Persian' or 'an Egyptian' as such.

For a more in-depth discussion of Alexander and Panhellenism, with specific examples, have a read of [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ki1uvd/im_a_young_farmhand_in_330_bc_spending_most_of_my/ggsmtmv/), but to condense out the key points, I think we ought to be wary of discussing Alexander's identity and the construction of his rule primarily on the basis of his outreach to the peoples of southern Greece. For one, most of southern Greece ultimately *did not buy it*, and fought against Alexander multiple times – Thebes in 335, Sparta in 331, and Athens and the Aitolian League in 323. For another, we need to be willing to approach Alexander as a universal monarch who simultaneously mobilised several languages of legitimacy, aimed at each individual constituency of his broader imperial sphere. Now, that can be used to justify one of two positions: If we claim Alexander was Greek because he successfully made use of Greek tools of legitimacy, then we equally ought to argue he was Egyptian and Persian. If we do not claim he was Egyptian or Persian simply because of his exploitation of Egyptian and Persian motifs, then we should not extend that to the Greeks either. This is, of course, presuming that we only base our view of him from his public-facing persona. We cannot exclude the possibility that he privately saw himself both as Greek and as Macedonian, but I would argue that much of his behaviour in his campaigns suggests otherwise. His appointment almost exclusively of Macedonians as satraps, his dismissal of large portions of his Greek allies after Gaugamela, and his cynical resettlement of former anti-Macedonian Greek mercenaries in the Iranian and Bactrian highlands all point to someone who saw his rule as predicated on the maintenance of a position of Macedonian superiority within his empire, and relied on a sense of Macedonian in-group loyalty. In other words, I would argue that Alexander ought to be understood as a Macedonian who nevertheless maintained a series of non-Macedonian public personas.

As with any discussion of Alexander it is vital to really dig into the sources, and I would like to stress that the notion of Alexander as a Greek hero, while not spun from whole cloth, is largely the product of two late literary histories, those of Arrian and Plutarch. I discuss these in more detail [in this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l06m2l/concerning_alexander_the_great_how_much_of_the/gjwy3ha/) and to some extent [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sv4k5i/did_alexander_the_great_get_valuable_intelligence/hxf2izy/), but to put it bluntly, both of these sources have a vested interest in portraying Alexander as extremely culturally Hellenised, and his campaigns, at least against the Persians, as sincere fulfilments of the Panhellenic dream of retribution for the Persian invasions of the Greek mainland and continued rule over the Greeks of Ionia. While based on sources contemporary with Alexander, they are selective in their use of these sources, and in such a way that specifically pushes their own narratives of Alexander as a pan-Greek hero, and we ought therefore to be extremely sceptical. Indeed, we ought to be *especially* so given that Plutarch is so quiet on Greco-Macedonian tensions in the *Life of Alexander*, when, as seen, the *Life of Eumenes* highlights such tensions with great frequency.

----- __735.2__ -----2022-08-24 13:22:32+08:00:

In the end, we probably ought to ask ourselves, 'what is a Greek?' and 'what is a Macedonian?' and while I don't think there is a one-size-fits-all definition, I think it helps to suggest the following: to possess a particular identity, you must make a claim to possessing that identity sincerely and in good faith; to a lesser extent, others holding the same identity must acknowledge it as such. And with Alexander, I simply do not believe that either criterion is matched. Alexander's claims to Greekness were, where they are reasonably certain not to be later interpolations, invariably confined to contexts in which he was communicating with Greeks; he did not propound Greekness to non-Greek peoples. Moreover, there is much to suggest that while some Greeks acknowledged these claims as legitimate within his own lifetime, they did not represent some grand consensus. The myth of the Panhellenic Alexander emerged out of a Hellenistic and Roman context.

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

This is not an answerable question because [the Silk Road never existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jsb5my/whats_the_state_of_scholarship_on_the_silk_road/gbyl2uc/). There never was a singular, marked route called the 'Silk Road' at any point in history.
