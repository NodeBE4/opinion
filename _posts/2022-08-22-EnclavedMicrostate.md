### 729: [Magical Michelada Mondays - Weekly Discussion Thread, August 22nd, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wuw70t/magical_michelada_mondays_weekly_discussion/), submitted on 2022-08-22 23:10:16+08:00.

> expressed an interest in learning Chinese

I feel like every time someone says 'Chinese' as though it's a single language I have to call it out.

----- __729.2__ -----2022-08-23 10:41:19+08:00:

In EN at least. I don't think she comes close to even 5% of ID's ability to call chat out on its bullshit.

----- __729.3__ -----2022-08-23 10:47:05+08:00:

Every language is significant to whoever speaks it. And there's plenty you haven't mentioned – Taishanese is a Yue language with very low mutual intelligibility with Cantonese and 3m+ speakers, some 44m+ speak Hakka varieties, there's the Gan languages in Jiangxi, etc.

----- __729.4__ -----2022-08-23 10:57:43+08:00:

Nope, not mutually intelligible (I speak from experience).

----- __729.5__ -----2022-08-23 11:07:35+08:00:

I feel we were spoiled by Myth getting theirs 9ish months in.

----- __729.6__ -----2022-08-23 12:34:25+08:00:

To be fair, no, but I speak as someone who speaks a non-Mandarin Sinitic language. Plus, Spanish and Italian dialects are, on the whole, far more mutually intelligible than Sinitic languages are. It's less 'using "Spanish" as a catch-all for all Iberian languages' and more 'using "German" to also refer to Dutch and Swedish'.

----- __729.7__ -----2022-08-23 13:09:45+08:00:

I didn't say 'actually mutually intelligible', I said *more* mutually intelligible. At least with Italian dialects you might pick up a word or two.

----- __729.8__ -----2022-08-23 13:10:04+08:00:

Basque is a language isolate though, it isn't even Indo-European.

----- __729.9__ -----2022-08-23 19:07:25+08:00:

I'm glad you can universalise your experience based on a country where Mandarin is the dominant Sinitic language, but *I am part of the annoyed minority here* as someone whose language is frequently ignored and increasingly endangered, even if markedly less so than a number of other languages, Sinitic or otherwise.

### 730: [[Formula 1] Off the Grid: F1's new owners shake things up by ditching Grid Girls, people are mad.](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/wv5ra7/formula_1_off_the_grid_f1s_new_owners_shake/), submitted on 2022-08-23 05:28:40+08:00.

Hi! Thanks for your submission to r/HobbyDrama.

Unfortunately, we have had to remove your post for violating Rule 9:

> Consequences of the drama must be detailed beyond "...and everyone was mad"

This would be suited to Scuffles, but not to being a top-level post.

### 731: [How many hours is an average UG weekly workload?](https://old.reddit.com/r/oxforduni/comments/wvm5zz/how_many_hours_is_an_average_ug_weekly_workload/), submitted on 2022-08-23 19:20:34+08:00.

----- __731.1__ -----2022-08-23 20:27:21+08:00:

It will depend how efficiently you apply yourself. For my part I typically only really 'worked' 8 hours a day, two and a half days a week (four days in terms where I had historiography/approaches papers running in parallel with my main term paper), and came away with a First at the end of it all. But that also entailed having done a certain amount of pre-reading out of term, in conjunction with a lot of informal 'work' in the form of simply spending time thinking things over even after handing something in.

----- __731.2__ -----2022-08-24 02:32:52+08:00:

> you'll really get caught out on that sort of a timescale.

I never was!

----- __731.3__ -----2022-08-24 02:33:44+08:00:

I ended up doing three (including a drama society which meant a lot of extra time commitment), although I tended to let that one take priority over the others rather than commit to absolutely everything.

### 732: [For people who dont know these tank silencers exist because there is a village nearby. Otherwise they would constantly hear noises of over 100db. this silencer reduces the noice by about 20db](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/wvmiq5/for_people_who_dont_know_these_tank_silencers/), submitted on 2022-08-23 19:38:46+08:00.

----- __732.1__ -----2022-08-24 02:54:59+08:00:

Tanks are armoured vehicles that are expected to be fired on by a lot of stuff and hopefully survive. Self-propelled howitzers are artillery pieces, some of which are armoured to give some measure of protection against enemy artillery fire, but rarely if ever protected enough to survive sustained attack because if it gets to that point, you are having a really bad day.
