Thanks to @GeringTuvia for sharing this recent SMG video on "telling China's story" with Zhang Weiwei, China's new voice on discourse power and China in the world. The naivete and self-congratulation (and scripted nodding) can be extreme.

RT Tessa Wong 黄晓恩<br>Months ago I reported on the ziganwu, Chinese online nationalists who attack anyone deemed as insulting China. Then they started attacking me – so I reported on that too.

RT Tom Kellogg<br>Re This film should be placed right beside works like @Anne_MarieBrady's Marketing Dictatorship and the day-to-day work of @cnmediaproject as a key exploration of how propaganda works to mold reality in contemporary China -- a must see. (6/end)

The former director and editor-in-chief of the China Youth Daily newspaper,Xu Zhuqing, passed away in Beijing on January 5 from lung cancer. He led the paper through what many now see as its golden age in the intellectual ferment of the 1980s. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/11/remembering-xu-zhuqing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/11/remembering-xu-zhuqing/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIzq5C0aUAE_JG2?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
