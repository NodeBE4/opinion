Thanks to @GeringTuvia for sharing this recent SMG video on "telling China's story" with Zhang Weiwei, China's new voice on discourse power and China in the world.

But worth a view. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j99aYMqfrLk&t=2175s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j99aYMqfrLk&t=2175s</a>

The former director and editor-in-chief of the China Youth Daily newspaper,Xu Zhuqing, passed away in Beijing on January 5 from lung cancer. He led the paper through what many now see as its golden age in the intellectual ferment of the 1980s. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/11/remembering-xu-zhuqing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/11/remembering-xu-zhuqing/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FIzq5C0aUAE_JG2?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
