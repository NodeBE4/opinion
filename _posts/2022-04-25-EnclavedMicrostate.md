Looks like it's just a somewhat americanised version of a [Mitraillette.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitraillette)

Frankly, Ame *is* the metaverse at this stage.

Something often tacitly ignored is the nomadic world here: notions of Chinese continuity rely heavily on eliding the point that nomadic regimes have dominated northern China several times, culminating with the Mongols establishing control over the whole thing for nearly a century. Painting China as this fully independent autochthonous entity rather blatantly elides that it wasn't.

So uh I guess I decided to post the thing in the previous thread after it was already off, so I'm reposting the exact same thing here.

____

So I have no idea how far this is of interest to anybody, but the discussion around Tsunderia's graduations and its effect on the agency's ranking relative to other EN agencies got me interested enough to do some data entry yesterday to find out. I won't share the full dataset here, but I did a bit of functioning and number crunching to produce [some graphs](https://imgur.com/a/sVVWrle).

To put it mildly, Tsunderia has dropped considerably within the league. To put it more extremely, Tsunderia has dropped *out* of the league. It had been a close contender with PRISM for the #2 spot in terms of total subscribers, while sitting comfortably in #3 for mean subs per member. It's now #5 in both categories, with *half* the total and average subs of Cyberlive at #4.

*That said*, a huge part of that is because of just how popular Miori Celesta is. At the time of her graduating, Miori accounted for a whopping *65%* of the agency's subscribers. Even if nobody else left, that would mean a huge hit in both total and average subs. But these are also, for that same reason, quite superficial numbers: how much traffic was Miori necessarily driving to the rest of Tsunderia, given how far ahead of the others she seems to have gone?

Which in turn raises an interesting note about the 'top-heaviness' of the other agencies: Production Kawaii looks like it has a big lead over Phase-Connect, but it would end up sandwiched between Phase-Connect and Cyberlive without Nene Amano. Cyberlive without Emma would only just edge ahead of Tsunderia post-graduations. PRISM and Phase-Connect, by contrast, seem to have a more even spread, and both would stay where they are rankings-wise without their top member.

What's interesting is that this doesn't contrast *that* heavily with the 'big 3' EN agencies (Holo/Niji/Vshojo), where some agencies have some quite extreme breakout stars, and some don't to the same extent. HoloEN is the top-heaviest, with Gura accounting for around 30% of its total YT subscribers; VShojo is quite close with Ironmouse having a little over 25% of its Twitch followers; NijiEN is the most evenly spread with Vox accounting for only 10% of the total subscribers. On the whole, the top-heaviness trends somewhat lower than at the smaller agencies, but not by an absurd margin, and Holo and Niji would definitely fall in the middle of the pack if mixed in with the others.

Anyway, that was me rambling about stats for a while.

This just in: it has recently been revealed that a surprising number of VTuber fans are in fact cannibals.

I genuinely hadn't clocked any prior discussion on 'Pettan 5' so if that's an issue I've edited that out. I did also do all the stats for the big 3, although I didn't do charts simply because the other stats are so disproportionate (though I can add those if desired). Looking at top-heaviness and mean time for all 8 agencies:

Agency | Mean time at agency (in months) | Top-heaviness %age
------|-------------------------------|------------------
HoloEN | 13.1 | 28.3%
NijiEN | 5.5 | 10.0%
VShojo | 15.9 | 28.1%
Tsunderia | 7.9 | 44.4%
Phase-Connect | 7.8 | 19.4%
Cyberlive | 5.4 | 42.8%
PRISM | 9.8 | 29.6%
Kawaii | 8.0 | 44.1%

So a quick note that because I now had to account for VShojo, the way the top-heaviness %age worked was modified slightly. Total subs for each agency were calculated not as total subs across all platforms, but the total of each individual member's higher sub counts between YT and Twitch. Basically, what I did was presume – not necessarily accurately, but well enough – that for instance most of Nyanners' 795k Twitch followers overlap with her 1.4m YT subscribers, while Ironmouse's 1.16m Twitch followers include most of her 685k YT subscribers. So I took the higher sub count, whichever platform it was, instead of just totalling YT+Twitch. If I had gone for all platforms rather than taking the higher of each, Ironmouse would be 22.2% of VShojo's total subs.

In the kouhai/kohai case, it's more complicated because it is a long vowel, so most common Romanisations render it with a diacritic, so either kōhai (Hepburn) or kôhai (Kunrei/Nihon-shiki). It would be technically incorrect to render it *kohai* without such a mark, hence why it's not entirely uncommon to write it out as *kouhai* if you can't easily produce a diacritic; it also matches the Japanese orthography more closely.

----- __377.5__ -----2022-04-26 11:10:35+08:00:

On the matter of top-heaviness, I came up with it as a quick and dirty way to look at the relative sub counts between the top member and the rest, given that with one exception (NijiEN), all of them have between 7 and 12 members which is a comfortably narrow range. I have been thinking of instead taking the ratio of the top member's subs to the agency mean, or even the mean of everyone *except* the top, which should account better for agency size. (EDIT: [I also graphed those](https://imgur.com/DV2bmJ0).)

As for VShojo numbers, as noted there are VShojo members with higher Youtube subscribers than Twitch followers – Nyanners and Melody in particular – hence the 'take the higher' approach.

As for tabled numbers I can do that; would probably be easier to take a screencap of my table and post an imgur link so [I've done that](https://imgur.com/yp1INNU).

Yes to the former, and both yes and no to the latter – sometimes they do attend in person to some extent, for instance Kiara was physically at Dokomi.
