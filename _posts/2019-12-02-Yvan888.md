若中国合法，我不一定强烈反对

但我自己肯定不会去支持合法大麻 毕竟我觉得烟酒都无趣的很 lol

----- __33.1__ -----2019-12-08 13:25:57+08:00:

Meanwhile, CCP wonders why China's soft power sucks af

Try to imagine a China with 10x population than Japan and South Korea and without censorship

----- __33.2__ -----2019-12-08 13:40:13+08:00:

tbh TW's soft power is much weaker than JP and SK and being overshadowed by mainland China

(if we just talk about soft power)

----- __33.3__ -----2019-12-08 14:45:24+08:00:

pretty sure it's not the main reason

If Taiwan can have success in the economy, then they could achieve the same thing in culture even if there's outside  pressure

Not saying in the world, even in mainland China, Taiwan's cultural influence keeps decreasing 

Go back to the 90s 00s, the mainland kids consume Hong Kong movies, Taiwan songs, Japanese animes, ​and Kpop...

Now, where is Taiwan's and Hong Kong's (added: emerging) influence? On the contrary, how many Taiwanese consuming CDrama, Cpop and Chinese web novels?

----- __33.4__ -----2019-12-08 15:23:24+08:00:

It's political correct to say that

----- __33.5__ -----2019-12-08 23:48:20+08:00:

These are hard power

----- __33.6__ -----2019-12-08 23:59:49+08:00:

That's why I say *decreasing*

Decreasing doesn't mean they're weak and vacuous now, but it's a tendency

If they cannot lead this game, then I doubt they have influence in the future (my bad, I should add *emerging* before *influence* in my last comment)

When is Jay Chou? When is Mayday? 

I mean, even if we talk about Jay Chou, what is his new popular song? "说好不哭"?

Of course there are emerging artists from Taiwan but I doubt any of them could have this dominance in greater China

Added: it depends on your generation 

I mean, you can argue that there are lots of mainlanders listening HK and TW emerging singers, but their influence cannot compare to the ones in 1980-2010

----- __33.7__ -----2019-12-09 00:01:12+08:00:

very insightful analysis, thanks 👍

----- __33.8__ -----2019-12-09 00:57:06+08:00:

Remind you:

I'm a guy who has consumed the entertainment content more from HK and TW (also JP) than from ML China when I was young. 

It's clear that both HK and TW entertainment dominance declines a lot in ML China, not only music itself but also dramas, novels, shows, self-medias, ​etc. 

Not to mention there are some contents TW had nothing to do at the beginning such as cartoon

> ”一定是中国作弊了”

讲道理，中国人作弊真的很猖狂，从我个人经验看，即使是985和美本中国人，也非常地严重，什么代写啊小抄啊之类的不少，向师兄师姐拿题目更是常规操作。

虽然诸如印度的学生也不少是这样，但只说西方人的话，他们还真有资格说这句话。

另外，中国作弊的更大的问题是，系统性的作弊是如此猖獗，以致很多人其实意识不到自己在作弊，比如国内泛滥成灾的TOEFL/GRE机经和文书代写。

----- __34.2__ -----2019-12-08 12:16:54+08:00:

几年前我可能认可你这句话，但现在我即在985待过又在美本待过，我倒是很理解为什么西方人会这么想我们

----- __34.4__ -----2019-12-08 14:51:14+08:00:

那当然有很多是优秀的不作弊的（就像原sub里面说的），但作弊的也很多

而且，像我说的，如果用严格的标准，把TG机经、文书代写这些都当作弊的话，那人又要减半了

----- __36.1__ -----2019-12-08 08:29:36+08:00:

OBOR is a comprehensive and huge project. 

Projecting China's economic influence? Sure. 

Enlarging China's geopolitical influence? Sure. 

But does it mean it's a zero-sum game? I don't think so. It's more like dealing with the bank, you can benefit from it to develop your countries but can also end up being bankruptcy

Also, some people think OBOR is a pure project seeking for foreign control is wrong. OBOR is also a manifestation of China's domestic issues, such as the ongoing supply-side structural reform (i.e., cutting overcapacity, destocking, deleveraging, reducing costs and identifying growth areas) and maturing domestic market (so Chinese companies must expand oversea to find other emerging markets)

---

Not saying OBOR is an angel, but OBOR is just controversial but not disreputable, at least until now. And these controversies also exist in other projects:

The people who regard OBOR as debt trap always don't realize that lots of third world countries hold the same opinion about IMF as well

The people who regard OBOR as neo-colonization always don't realize that the western (actually any other foreign countries') cooperations have the same notoriety according to some third world nationalists

etc.

But, well, they will just say the third world leaders who buy OBOR are all corrupt and selfish leaders begging for China's money and deny any balanced analysis

If you're interested in how China's state media portrays OBOR, here is a [a series of One Belt One Road Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NtprkECCiU) by CCP's mouthpiece

You can also visit the third world countries​ forums to see how they view OBOR

----- __36.2__ -----2019-12-08 08:57:54+08:00:

I don' think there is a clear Yes-or-No answer to this question, it depends on the bilateral negotiation. The agreement was signed by both sides. It just likes you cannot use Yes-or-No to answer the Argentina-IMF issue or European debt crisis.

But I can tell you that actually OBOR is​ always questioned by Chinese domestic scholars too because they think it's at high risk that China cannot get back the loan and a waste of Chinese wealth. These arguments wouldn't happen if OBOR is an uncontested one-side beneficial plan.

If yes, I have to remind you that 95% people in this sub are western expats but not Chinese

I'm not saying their arguments are wrong, most of them are pretty insightful too, but if you want to hear some opinions from the other side, I'm afraid that here is not a suitable place

----- __36.4__ -----2019-12-08 09:22:03+08:00:

Both answers above are pretty correct

The information control in China is crazy and increasing in these years.

However, go back to your question:

> How easy is it for an average Chinese to get hold of any information/ bypassing state control?

Pretty easy. 

Actually, it's zero-difficult to get VPNs (there are tons) and bypass the GFW.

And it's not hard and low risk to see the political sensitive contents on youtube etc

Not to say there are a huge amount of Chinese international students and global businessmen and researchers annually. All of them can get access to western media and information...

But it's at high risk if you try to broadcast "unharmonious" contents and organize an anti-government activity

However, their values and view of the world were shaped when they're kids so it's not that easy for them to off-load the indoctrinated contents even if they have a Ivy League degree or something...

> He also talked about information exchange e.g. all young people know Justin Bieber but we don't know any Chinese pop stars. So his argument is that Western media is more restrictive because it doesn't show anything about China except negativity. But a Chinese knows a lot about Western culture (positive and negative) so China is more open to Western information. How true is this?

It's a very silly argument... It's just because the west (and also Japan and South Korea) have greater soft power 

> Is the average Chinese well informed about the West (in an objective manner) or they just know propaganda?

It depends on what you're asking. At least the well-educated teenagers know much about the west: arts, history, politics, economy, etc. For example, [a discussion about your country on​ a Chinese website](https://www.zhihu.com/question/24839853)

It includes some contents you may view as sensitive or banned. For example, [*1984* is actually popular in China](https://search.douban.com/book/subject_search?search_text=1984&cat=1001)

But overall, they are still at odds with the universal values

----- __36.6__ -----2019-12-08 09:47:29+08:00:

LMAO 

I'm not talking about how I think but how some third world people think 

I think you misunderstand one point, when the people choose to accept China's money, it doesn't mean they like China and hate the west. They just want to balance the great power influences in their countries. They can use the power from China to balance the west now. They can also use the power from India to balance China in the future. By putting the eggs in different baskets, they can try to seek a larger benefit for their countries. That's all.

Added: your argument has no conflict with my argument even if on the IMF's part. 

> The IMF is NOT comparable to the OBOR.. The IMF doesn't do development financing, they are a lender of last resort ...

I'm not talking about IMF is like OBOR or vice versa. But there are people thinking IMF is a debt trap even if the IMF is a lender of last resort (on the contrary, I don't know there are some guys thinking World Bank is a debt trap and that's why I mention IMF here)... Further, the conspiracy theorists think it's a game played by the international financiers and IMF is a tool of them to try to control the assets or something, e.g. 1997 Soros's Asian Financial Crisis (Again, it's their opinions, not mine)

Edit2: 

> People who criticize the IMF, and say we can get money from China ... If Chinese don't like the World Bank, they can tell the World Bank to stop lending them 2 Billion US a year.

I'm not talking about China here and it has nothing to do with China. Otherwise, why I used *the third world* but not *China*
