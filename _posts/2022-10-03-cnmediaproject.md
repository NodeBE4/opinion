Until Xi Jinping's banner term is shortened at the upcoming 20th National Congress, this will be a serious problem for shorter bridges.<br><br>Matthew Walsh: Slogan season in Beijing, and this one in Dongzhimen just rolls off the tongue: “Spare no effort in composing a new chapter of comprehensively building a socialist modern Beijing under the guidance of Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.”<br><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FeEedn-aYAAMhat?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

A quick look at how various policy-related permutations of Xi Jinping's "banner term" (旗帜语) have been faring ahead of the 20th National Congress. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/03/xiplomacy-gets-rare-stage-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/03/xiplomacy-gets-rare-stage-time/</a>

Exhausted by the speculation and commentary over the upcoming 20th National Congress of the CCP, which will prove important (but as exciting as watching paint dry)? . . . . Perhaps you should read about "political depression" in the CMP Dictionary. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/political-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/political-depression/</a>

Re This piece by Martin Wolf in the FT is also well worth a read. "Ten years is always enough." <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa1510a3-0ea9-4eab-a67c-392c7704fdb1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ft.com/content/fa1510a3-0ea9-4eab-a67c-392c7704fdb1</a>

Our latest: a fascinating example of how the Chinese leadership appropriates popular memes from social media to incorporate them into "mainstream" (CCP-led) propaganda. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/06/no-lying-down-on-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/06/no-lying-down-on-covid/</a>

"Lying down" (躺平) rose in popularity in 2021 in China as an anti-battle-cry against ambition. Now the CCP leadership is turning the buzzword into a harsh critique of those who suggest the country should relax Covid-related restrictions. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/06/no-lying-down-on-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/06/no-lying-down-on-covid/</a>

It's not often that we promote a post that is more than 5 years old. But CMP's analysis in March 2017 of how Xi Jinping MIGHT POSSIBLY frame his "banner term" and seal his legacy is a crucial look at the 20th National Congress thru what might have been. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2017/03/19/xi-jinping-gotten-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2017/03/19/xi-jinping-gotten-crown/</a>

Re At that time, we looked at several possibilities, which included Xi Jinping Theory" (习近平理论) and "Xi Jinping Strategy" (习近平战略).

Re Might it instead have been "Xi Jinping Concept” (习近平理念)? . . . All of these seemingly pointless questions are in fact very important within the CCP's political culture and history. Understanding that is critical to understanding what comes at the 20th Nat. Congress.
