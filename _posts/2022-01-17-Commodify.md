### 35: [What were the main factors that led to the French losing against the Việt Minh during the First Indochina War?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/s5j4m1/what_were_the_main_factors_that_led_to_the_french/), submitted on 2022-01-17 03:16:59+08:00.

That they were basically fighting China. The book Building Ho's Army goes into this in detail. The French War in Indochina had roughly two phases. From 1946 to 1949, things were going fairly well. Come the end of the Chinese Civil War, you see the newly formed PRC send an almost endless supply of food, munitions, rifles, and money to the Viet Minh. Noting the deficiency of his forces up to that point, Ho Chi Minh subordinated his generals to a group of PLA officers known as the Chinese Military Advisory Group. That group started planning operations using their experience in the Chinese Civil War, starting with Route Coloniale 4 and culminating in Dien Bien Phu.

The extent of this support and the kind of army it allowed the Viet Minh to build is difficult to understate. So often the First Indochina War falls under the same imagery as later COIN wars - a small group of guerrillas blending into the population and conducting hit and run attacks until the occupier is exhausted. Nothing could be further from the truth. By the start of the Siege of Dien Bien Phu, the Viet Minh was a *conventionally superior* force to the French army and was physically in control of [the vast majority of the country](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/First_Indochina_War_map_1954_en.svg).

As soon as the Nationalists lost across the border, French defeat was essentially a given. Even if Dien Bien Phu had been their most decisive victory since the days of Napoleon, the Viet Minh would simply rebuild. China was giving them a blank check to cover all their expenses, more guns and ammunition than they had men to use, and some its best officers on loan. The only way the French could have won was by killing every Vietnamese male of age to deny the Viet Minh a source of recruits. The other option was to disrupt the Viet Minh's rear areas and securing territories along the Chinese border. The French did attempt this and it was working in some places, but it ultimately culminated in Dien Bien Phu.

>The PLA were involved in building the Viet Minh's capabilities after 1949. Prior to that the PLA could provide little to no aid. But the Viet Minh proved highly capable even when left to their own devices. The DRV in the north mobilized their population to an enormous degree and while they lacked arms and experience, they still proved a formidable barrier to the French army winning. Sure, the French won most of their battles in the north; but drew or lost plenty more. Such that by 1947 that the DRV in the north could hold their own against even the largest French offensives.

That's the thing though - they were restricted to the North when they had at one point controlled the majority of the country, losing it to a mix of Japanese (post-surrender), British, and French forces up 1947 and seeing their main force confined to a mountainous pocket in the north. Combat performance improved significantly after 1949 and they regained the majority of Vietnam again.

> No, it really wasn't. Operation Lea in 1947 is a good example of just how much trouble the French were in. Operation Lea's goals was to: (a) capture the Viet Minh leadership; (b) seize a large base of operations; and (c) surround and destroy the Viet Minh forces in the region. The French with 15,000 men (including paratroops) with a vast superiority in artillery, armored vehicles and aircraft faced off against twice their number of Vietnamese with no heavy arms and achieved none of their goals.

It was a strategic failure, but a considerable tactical success and certainly didn't speak highly to Viet Minh *combat* abilities at the time, just their capacity to maneuver (relatively) more quickly than the French in the North. Operation Lea involved a march all the way from Lang Song, through Cao bang and connecting with the French frontline at Yen Bai in the West. It divided the Viet Minh base area in two and involved a pursuit of the main Viet Minh force over more than 200 km of dense mountains.

> This was followed by Operation Ceinture the goal of which to seize control of territory between major French positions in the north and to destroy the Viet Minh forces operating there. The French sent out 25,000 men, failed to connect and after a month abandoned all their gains because they didn't have the men to hold them down. The French lacked the men to hold down Vietnam and they knew it. The entire conducted of the war in the north was essentially dictated by that fact. The French mobile elements were repeatedly thrown at the Viet Minh to no strategic effect. The only real strategic successes of the French after the initial seizure of the cities were their offensives aimed at improving their defensive positions to reduce the number of men needed for garrison duty. In short, the French were well aware from 1946 things were not going well and things which had hitherto been "impossible" like granting Vietnam a measure of independence, something that the French had denounced in 1946 as radical nonsense, was accepted reality by 1948. If the French had granted Vietnam limited independence in 1946, the Viet Minh would have agreed to peace. When the French finally got around to doing this in 1948, the Viet Minh turned their noses up at it, seeing it as a desperate measure, and demanded even more substantive concessions.

This is very true. The French were an order of magnitude less powerful, both in terms of resources and deployable manpower to the Americans in the second war and quickly realized the elimination of the Viet Minh was not a possibility - only their containment and a negotiated solution.

### 36: [Why did the US Navy lose as many Cruisers as they did in the Guadalcanal campaign?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/s65o35/why_did_the_us_navy_lose_as_many_cruisers_as_they/), submitted on 2022-01-17 22:48:21+08:00.

----- __36.1__ -----2022-01-18 00:15:37+08:00:

The majority of the CAs were lost in a single battle: the engagement around Savo Island. During this battle, a Japanese cruiser force noticed a group of American cruisers at night and attacked it. Night battles tend to favor the side that lands a shot first, since the fires silhouette the enemy ships and make them easier to hit, and nighttime drill was a huge emphasis for the IJN and a non-emphasis for the USN. The Japanese also had a better torpedo and generally better naval gunnery. Put together, these factors turned the battle into a slaughter.

Japanese and American cruiser losses for the rest of the campaign were roughly equal.

### 37: [Was battle of Imphal winnable?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/s6seai/was_battle_of_imphal_winnable/), submitted on 2022-01-18 16:08:00+08:00.

----- __37.1__ -----2022-01-18 23:48:44+08:00:

Only if the British had made the same mistake they were making for three years before that and placed their depots closed to the front. The British decision to hold supply deep in the rear essentially doomed the Japanese offensive from the start. There was absolutely zero way the IJA could have scored even an operational success at that point (as u/124876720 brought up, a strategic success was out of the question), since there was no avoiding starvation. The argument is sometimes made by Japanese historians that Mutaguchi should have waited for more food, but no such food was forthcoming because of submarine warfare. More, it had been an established assumption of the IJA since Malaya that, when fighting Europeans, you didn't have to worry about supplies because you could just take them. This is one of the few campaigns in WW2 where we can confidently say the outcome was predetermined and nothing could have changed it.

### 38: [Machiavelli fought for Florence to revive the citizen legions of ancient Rome, but forces raised long these lines were catastrophically defeated at Prato in 1512. Was Machiavelli's idea implausible, or was it merely not given enough time?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/s7d1mo/machiavelli_fought_for_florence_to_revive_the/), submitted on 2022-01-19 08:51:40+08:00.

>Basically Machiavelli's premise was wrong regarding mercenary competence. Machiavelli believed that mercenaries at the time (called condottieri) were unreliable charlatans that fight for the highest bidder and would frequently change sides since they owe no loyalty to their employer but fight merely out if financial obligation. Now, I've never seen any statistics regarding the reliability of paid soldiers in the Italian Wars period. But to reduce them to merely unreliable turncoats ignores a very important fact: these were professional soldiers.

To expand on this, Stephen Turnbull's *The Knight Triumphant* spends a whole page going through times Machiavelli claimed there were few or no deaths in mercenary battles, but in fact hundreds of mercenaries died for their employers in each engagement.

Machiavelli was a member of the *popolo* class of Italy, a rising professional-mercantile bourgeois class. They resented the lords and their mercenary armies. Like virtually everyone else in the middle ages, Machiavelli was relying on a mix of unreliable field reports and rumor to derive his conclusions about battles. It's almost certain that he and his fellow popolo revolutionaries *actually* believed the mercenaries were a bunch of overpaid cowards whom "properly motivated citizens" could defeat.

----- __38.2__ -----2022-01-20 03:03:03+08:00:

*A lot* changed by then. For one armor and melee combat were no longer important for victory. Contra popular belief, armored, mounted soldiers were not at their nadir in Machiavelli's age but at their peak. The knights who were getting mowed down by English longbowmen in the Hundred Years War were largely wearing chainmail and partial plate. By Machiavelli's time, full plate had become a widespread innovation and essentially rendered its users invulnerable to arrows and sharp or piercing weapons. It's no surprise in light of this that *half* the French army that invaded Italy during Machiavelli's lifetime were mounted knights - fifty years after they had supposedly performed "disastrously" in the Hundred Years War. In the same way tanks culminated with the modern MBT, the technology of armor only reached perfection towards the end of its useful life.

By Napoleon's time, battles were being fought by unarmored men in formations drilled to perform the very simple task of reloading and firing in volley. The role that required the most skill in an army was that of the skirmisher, but this too was infinitely less complicated than the intricacies of being a soldier in Machiavelli's time. Knowing how to aim, reload, and fire a musket is much less complicated than learning to fight with weapons and wrestle (the second being decisive in all fights between two armored men).

We have no sources that go into detail as to *why* Machiavelli's soldiers were crushed by the armored Spanish and their mercenaries, but I think it's pretty obvious when you look at the training and equipment of the two sides.

----- __38.3__ -----2022-01-20 03:53:32+08:00:

Absolutely critical skills which a wealth of primary source evidence says can be drilled into men in a quarter or less. Try learning wrestling in that time.

----- __38.4__ -----2022-01-21 00:11:18+08:00:

Agincourt for one - the whole thing was settled with a scramble in the mud.

----- __38.5__ -----2022-01-21 00:19:14+08:00:

They did: the Spanish eventually introduced disciplined pike squares which had first been in use by the Swiss. This innovation was decisive.

----- __38.6__ -----2022-01-21 01:45:36+08:00:

They *mostly* didn't do any one thing because all medieval battles involved soldiers deploying a combination of skills. The only place to find a fight that involved only jousting, shooting, swordplay, or wrestling was a tourney.

### 39: [Russia/USSR sold weapons to China which Beijing went on to copy. Despite Russia's anger, they continue to sell weapons to China. Is this common in arms trade?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/s7kkwi/russiaussr_sold_weapons_to_china_which_beijing/), submitted on 2022-01-19 15:28:00+08:00.

----- __39.1__ -----2022-01-20 02:52:00+08:00:

Great post. To expand upon the licenses post, today China and Russia have settled on a fairly reasonable agreement where China is effectively allowed to reverse engineer platforms but is not allowed to export them, usually given the PR wrapping of "sale of licenses". This is one of two reasons (the other being their unwillingness to alter production lines for foreign orders) that China is not a major arms exporter. It's effectively Russia acknowledging that a country as large and industrially strong as China is not going to settle on being an arms importer and allowing them to build domestic lines as long as they don't compete with Russian products internationally.

### 40: [Suppose a garrison in the Russian Far East in 1812. When do they hear that Napoleon is invading Russia in the west? Can they be mobilised to defend Moscow? How would they even get there?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/s8lbph/suppose_a_garrison_in_the_russian_far_east_in/), submitted on 2022-01-20 23:20:53+08:00.

----- __40.1__ -----2022-01-21 00:47:04+08:00:

They would likely be ordered to stay put, if they hear at all. All the most valuable parts of the Russian far east today - Vladivostok and the area up the Amur - was not part of Russia in 1812, but only became part of Russia during the Taiping rebellion. The Russian Far East at the time was a barren, inhospitable, and scarcely populated territory with only minimal garrisons. The only significant conflicts in that area were the Russian-Qing border wars more than a century earlier, in which both sides deployed troop numbers in the low thousands.

Logistically, it was very difficult to supply even these garrisons. Well into the late 19th century, Russia's immediate East - the Volga region and Western Siberia - were subject to pervasive Kazakh raids. That problem had to be resolved first before any stable logistical connection to the East could be established. For the duration of the Russian Empire - but especially in the early 19th century - it was essentially multiple political units strung together only by allegiance to the ruler. The vast majority of Russia's non-Slavic populations served the Tsar as vassals and envisioned him as their Khan. The Bashkirs famously went into battle against Napoleon as *horse archers*. This arrangement required minimal "garrison activity", and therefore a low commitment of troops by the central government, but also meant very few forces could be procured from any area East of the Urals. The auxiliaries Russia relied on to bolster local rulers had little attachment to the central government, and the garrisons Russia deployed were too small to make a different.
