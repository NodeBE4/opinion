### 456: [8+ Redding CA police officers brutalize man. Attack him with K-9 and stomp on his head.](https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/10ol3f0/8_redding_ca_police_officers_brutalize_man_attack/), submitted on 2023-01-30 06:44:48+08:00.

This is why all the "back the blue" shit is intolerable.  More stupid fucking cops being stupid fucking cops.  Just what this country needs.  And California cops seem to be a special breed of pathologically anti-social and sadistic.

What is your internship in? 

Relatedly, I agree with you.

> student teaching?

Ah, yes.  The racket of higher education.

>  But I ALSO PAY TUITION for a whole semester

You're getting ripped off.  Work in the private sector.

I disagree, but you're an education major and do not appear to be pursuing, or have obtained, a terminal degree, so the reasons why aren't likely to make sense for you. 

In the United States, when you're in graduate school pursuing a terminal degree, particularly something of value (e.g., STEM field, something quantitative-focused and the like), there is a financial value that attaches to the labor involved in *your* actually teaching undergraduate students.  

There is also some financial value associated with doing that in worthless fields (e.g., women's studies, sociology or history), but it's nominal.  

The financial value that's on the line is, at the very least, all the money a college/university didn't have to pay someone with a terminal degree for those hours providing instruction.

It turns out universities/colleges really like to have their graduate students teach courses like that, or do all the heavy lifting involved with teaching such a course, because the university is always financially better off in that case.

For example, if an actual professor who can secure grants is spending time teaching undergrads, the university isn't benefiting from the grant money he might secure if his time was spent doing those things.

Likewise, if an actual professor who can generate "elitist cred" (e.g., writing papers that get cited by literally everyone in the field doing anything that matters), or contributing to the research underlying such a paper, then the professor is increasing the probability of the university's receiving future grants or other monies.  

That means teaching undergraduates is a lesser priority (if any priority at all), because this is about money for university administration.  Maybe the graduate students get enough money in the form of a stipend so that they can just barely afford not to starve.  Maybe not.  But the University President is going to make 750k/yr (or probably more) for doing nothing other than wining and dining the rich and powerful alums, to get more money for . . . whatever money can be used for.

What you likely do not understand, and are probably intellectually incapable of accepting, is that the more time a professor (or any relevant actor) spends teaching a course, the less better off he is, his department is, the president of the university is and everyone in university administration.  

So that means that students are a lesser priority.  Many of them want to learn, but the reality is that at a certain level of university (where I am sure you are not presently attending, otherwise you might have gathered some sense of this) most of the students could teach themselves and only really required some guidance as to where to focus their efforts.  

The rouse is that you're there to learn stuff about things.  The reality is that you are a mere inconvenience to the pursuit of financial gain, that is still somewhat necessary to justify the university's existence.  And you pay them for the privilege, in exchange for a degree signifying that you attended and maybe learned something.  Although if you're majoring in education, it seems fairly unlikely you learned anything other than how to do let a frat boy take Jello shots off of various parts of your body while playing beer pong. 

Unless you're one of the woke types, in which case you not only learned nothing but you likely had no fun in the process of incurring more than a hundred thousand dollars of student debt in exchange for a piece of paper that signifies you made poor life choices.

Indeed, a racket by definition.  And you've just heard from a ghost in the machine.

Don't pick a stupid major.  Stupid majors include, but are not limited to, education, women's studies, communication, history, sociology, psychology, English and the list goes on and on.  In your best life, you are working in Silicon Valley doing something like content moderation on Twitter or maybe you work in Human Resources at Google.  Layoffs abound, but that was foreseeable because those fields create no value whatsoever.  Pick a major that enables you to create value.

> Ozzy and Black Sabbath are some of the biggest musical influences in modern rock. As long as humans have music, his legacy will live on. He’s one of those guys that I never really pictured dying. It’s sad that he’s getting up there. What a legend.

Black Sabbath was my introduction to metal and I've loved Ozzy Osbourne since the first time I heard Paranoid.  

His music has changed over the years, but he is a legend in his own rite.  

I wish I could get one more Ozzfest.

I am reminded of a Bill Burr comment on bands in that situation.

> According to my dad, some of the COs would tip the more violent inmates off about child abusers

According to the accounts of people I know that have knowledge of such situations (I'm sorry I can't be more specific), that is indeed what happens.  That information will eventually be known by the general population, one way or another.  Even prison gangs that hate each other agree that they all hate child abusers more.  And they'll cooperate with one another to exact their own variety of justice.

----- __461.3__ -----2023-02-05 00:02:07+08:00:

What does that refer to?  I'm not trying to be petulant I just really have no idea what that means.  I have never taught grade school students and I haven't heard that term before.

If everywhere had ubiquitous monitoring, then maybe a certain mathematician whose name starts with the letter "K" was right.

### 463: [Bill That Would Allow Inmates to Trade Their Organs for Less Prison Time Introduced in Massachusetts](https://old.reddit.com/r/DarkFuturology/comments/10t2lqw/bill_that_would_allow_inmates_to_trade_their/), submitted on 2023-02-04 10:27:18+08:00.

Talk about creating an incentive to flood the prisons.  

It takes no difficulty whatsoever to realize how certain individuals might even be targeted for "incarceration," based on their genetic information (known or inferred from aggregated databases).

For example, suppose you (or someone sufficiently closely related to you) submitted their genetic information to 23andMe or any other such company. 

With that information, at least one of the following two things could be accomplished:

First, an exact donor match might be identified.

Second, a very precise pool of candidate donors could be narrowed from the general population.

How that information might be used should shock the conscience of any decent, thinking person.
