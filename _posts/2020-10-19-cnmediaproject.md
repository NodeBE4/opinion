A recent @WSJ article reports that Chinese officials have threatened to detain U.S. citizens in response to the Justice Department’s prosecution of Chinese military-affiliated scholars. How seriously should the US take these threats?

1/ Sweden's post & telecoms authority has announced that #Huawei will be excluded from the 5G network. This includes essentially the entire network, including radio access (RAN). This is the most open and most far-reaching option Sweden could have chosen. <a href="http://shorturl.at/cqELX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://shorturl.at/cqELX</a>

Re 3/ Until 1 January 2025, operators have to make sure all central functions are located in Sweden and depend on Swedish personnel only. The decision is based on a law that was adopted last year and came into force on 1 January 2020. It allows the security services the exclusion.

Re 6/ Assessment: ZTE and Huawei are effectively banned in most EU countries, though by different means and to different degrees. Sweden has chosen a particularly explicit and rather comprehensive ban (though not going entirely as far as the UK).

A cool read, basically to know China up-close. For observers, students of geopolitics and strategists :) <br>Thank you @ananthkrishnan for the wonderful trip <br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkyAstkVcAAeTIr?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

I wrote about increasingly prevalent Weibo account censorship, aka account bombing (炸号) for @restofworld. This is a story about suppression and resistance. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/weibo-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://restofworld.org/2020/weibo-bombing/</a>

Re-upping this story for folks in Asia. Arguments over to what extent trends in present-day China echo the Cultural Revolution are always fraught. We’re obviously a long way from teenagers murdering their teachers. Still, there are startling parallels...<br><br><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-xi-jinpings-china-nationalism-takes-a-dark-turn-11603382993?mod=hp_lead_pos10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-xi-jinpings-china-nationalism-takes-a-dark-turn-11603382993?mod=hp_lead_pos10</a>
