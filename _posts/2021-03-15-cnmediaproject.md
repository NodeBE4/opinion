Re @CarlMinzner @dbandurski More soon from CMP on this. Yes, there is a marked increase in Xi Jinping power signaling in the report this year. Just mentions of "Xi Jinping" are up almost 90% in a report only about 20% longer.

Re @CarlMinzner @dbandurski The appearance of "Xi Thought" permutations like "Xi Jinping Thought on Rule of Law" are notable -- but  interesting to see "Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy" actually disappear between 2020 and 2021 reports.
