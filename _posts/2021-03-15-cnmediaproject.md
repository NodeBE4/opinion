Re @CarlMinzner @dbandurski More soon from CMP on this. Yes, there is a marked increase in Xi Jinping power signaling in the report this year. Just mentions of "Xi Jinping" are up almost 90% in a report only about 20% longer.

Re @CarlMinzner @dbandurski The appearance of "Xi Thought" permutations like "Xi Jinping Thought on Rule of Law" are notable -- but  interesting to see "Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy" actually disappear between 2020 and 2021 reports.

What does Li Zhanshu's work report to the NPC Standing Committee tell us? David Bandurski breaks (some of) it down -- so you don't have to suffer through it. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/03/15/what-does-li-zhanshus-report-tell-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/03/15/what-does-li-zhanshus-report-tell-us/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ewh-LmmXIAMiJ4u?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Chris Fraser<br>“Hong Kong risks losing its standing as a vibrant place for world-class research, teaching, and the sharing of ideas, where students and scholars can innovate for everyone’s benefit.” I would say it is already too late. <a href="https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/2021/03/reverse-the-rapid-deterioration-of-academic-freedom-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/2021/03/reverse-the-rapid-deterioration-of-academic-freedom-in-hong-kong/</a>
