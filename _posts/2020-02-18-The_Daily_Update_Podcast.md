  <p>
   Today Stratechery is launching a new product: the
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/podcasts/">
    Daily Update Podcast
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <h4>
   What is the Daily Update Podcast?
  </h4>
  <p>
   The Daily Update Podcast is the audio version of the
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/daily-update">
    Daily Update
   </a>
   . The Daily Update consists of three subscriber-only posts that, in addition to the free Weekly Article, arrive in your inbox every morning. Now, you can not only read the Daily Update via email or the web, you can also choose to listen to the Daily Update (and the Weekly Article) in your favorite podcast player.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Who reads the Daily Update Podcast?
  </h4>
  <p>
   Most days, I will read the Daily Update, with an assist from
   <a href="https://twitter.com/damanr">
    Daman Rangoola
   </a>
   (he reads the blockquotes, to make it easier to follow). If I am traveling or otherwise unable to record, then Daman will record the Daily Update Podcast.
  </p>
  <p>
   As for who listens to the Daily Update Podcast (which, to be clear, includes the free Weekly Article), it is Daily Update subscribers only.
  </p>
  <h4>
   When does the Daily Update Podcast come out?
  </h4>
  <p>
   The Daily Update podcast will come out a few hours after the Daily Update email. It takes some time to edit the podcast, including adding all of the cool features that make this a particularly unique podcast.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, the show notes for every podcast contain the full Daily Update post, so you can easily find links and illustrations. The Daily Update podcast also supports chapters, which correspond to the different sections of the Daily Update or Weekly Article. Plus, some podcast players, like
   <a href="https://overcast.fm/">
    Overcast
   </a>
   , show Stratechery illustrations as cover art at precisely the right moments:

  </div>
  <p>
   And yes, future
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">
    Stratechery interviews
   </a>
   will be more than just transcripts.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Where do I listen to the Daily Update Podcast?
  </h4>
  <p>
   The Daily Update Podcast can be played in any podcast player that supports the open ecosystem of podcasting (unfortunately this does not include Spotify, Google Podcasts, or Stitcher; to be very clear, this is not my choice). You can also read the Daily Update in any RSS Reader.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Why did you launch the Daily Update Podcast?
  </h4>
  <p>
   The Daily Update Podcast has been one of the most requested features since I launched the Daily Update. Many subscribers have long commutes and would like to listen to the Daily Update in the car, on the train, or while walking.
  </p>
  <h4>
   How does the Daily Update Podcast work?
  </h4>
  <p>
   Every Daily Update subscriber has access to their own individual feed. Stratechery makes it easy for you to add that feed to your favorite podcast player.
  </p>
  <p>
   Start by
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/podcasts/">
    visiting the Daily Update Podcast page
