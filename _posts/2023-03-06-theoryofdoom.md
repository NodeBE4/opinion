### 496: [Mom Looking for Advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/11j0tpx/mom_looking_for_advice/), submitted on 2023-03-06 00:13:19+08:00.

Your son is not trans.  

Anyone who pushes you to conclude that he is trans is wrong.  

Let your son be your son.  Tell everyone else who wants to make him into something he is not to fuck off. 

Please DO NOT TAKE HIM to any "gender" clinic.  If you did, you would ruin his life.  And when he is old enough to realize what was done to his body, he will hate you for failing to be the adult and protecting his best interest.

> Because some of those people want there to be more of them…

Correct, no matter how much harm that causes.

----- __496.3__ -----2023-03-06 04:04:34+08:00:

> It's been described by various people as "woke homophobia."

That is 100% correct.  There is nothing more repulsive than woke homophobia.

> My daughter is 13 and I am surprised by how many girls she has known her whole life, who never were gender non-conforming in any way, have suddenly come out as trans. 

That's because of a social phenomena called a cascading or snowballing effect. 

It is clear in the data: when trans became trendy, lots of kids started to think they were trans when they absolutely were not.  They were just awkward tweens and teenagers, who listened to incompetent "advice" from "professionals" who were pushing a political agenda.  

It's very dark and very unpopular to talk about.

> I don't need a certain family member telling me there's some other, "better" version of him (esp. as her version of better seems less likely. Maybe I am a transphobe, but it does not seem more likely to me that a trans woman will find a long term longing relationship than a gay man--and unlike this certain relative of mine, I don't think there is anything inherently disgusting or "violent"--her word not mine--about sex between two men. Also, why is anyone talking to me about he 11 year olds potential future sex life?). And I sure as hell don't need him hearing any of that. Because as far I am concerned, he's perfect.

You are not a transphobe.  That certain family member of yours seems to be out of touch with reality.  

Let your son be your son, and keep the people who want to remake him into something they'd like him to be out of his life.

I seriously recommend you keep that certain family member of yours OUT of your son's life.

Everything about that individual's involvement here makes my skin crawl.

Upvoting this good advice.

To the extent this question seeks guidance on how to engage in a criminal action without being caught, it is not appropriate for this subreddit.  This is not the place.

We also strongly caution you from taking legal advice received from anyone on the internet.  We would be very concerned if you or anyone with a similar question relied, to your/their detriment, on any legal advice you received here.  That's why we can't allow this question. Please seek competent legal advice from a licensed, practicing attorney with expertise on the matter.

### 498: [Saw my boyfriend on Sniffies, how do I tell him I'm fine with it](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/11j4xrx/saw_my_boyfriend_on_sniffies_how_do_i_tell_him_im/), submitted on 2023-03-06 01:51:58+08:00.

I am sorry for asking a question everyone here seems to know the answer to . . . but what is "Sniffies"?
