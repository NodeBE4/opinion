Your son is not trans.  

Anyone who pushes you to conclude that he is trans is wrong.  

Let your son be your son.  Tell everyone else who wants to make him into something he is not to fuck off. 

Please DO NOT TAKE HIM to any "gender" clinic.  If you did, you would ruin his life.  And when he is old enough to realize what was done to his body, he will hate you for failing to be the adult and protecting his best interest.

> Because some of those people want there to be more of them…

Correct, no matter how much harm that causes.

> It's been described by various people as "woke homophobia."

That is 100% correct.  There is nothing more repulsive than woke homophobia.

> My daughter is 13 and I am surprised by how many girls she has known her whole life, who never were gender non-conforming in any way, have suddenly come out as trans. 

That's because of a social phenomena called a cascading or snowballing effect. 

It is clear in the data: when trans became trendy, lots of kids started to think they were trans when they absolutely were not.  They were just awkward tweens and teenagers, who listened to incompetent "advice" from "professionals" who were pushing a political agenda.  

It's very dark and very unpopular to talk about.
