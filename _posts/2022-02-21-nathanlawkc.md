Not sure why we continue to allow Chinese officials to use the platform they banned in the PRC to spread lies and stigmatization (with an Iphone).<br>Anyone overlooking the ongoing Crimes Against Humanities in Xinjiang, Tibet and suppression in Hong Kong is the colluder of dictators<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMRv8XmXMAA48SL?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

🇺🇦🏴<br>1. The documentary “Winter on Fire” has been a documentary Hong Kong protestors are watching. We  understand how it feels to have a threatening neighbour and people’s will being suppressed by authoritarian power.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMXEiDMWQAQ2SL6?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. Our Ukrainian friends have been supporting our struggles against dictatorship. It’s time that we support their fight. Talk to your Ukrainian friends, shop Ukrainian products, follow the news, and most importantly, urge the international community to act.<br>#StandWithUkraine<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMXDi3KWYAIgGK6?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

I want to pay my tribute to the protestors in Mosco and other cities in Russia — they have shown that not all nationals support dictators like Putin, Xi, and many others.<br>We all share the pain of living under a brutal regime. The fight is also ours, to end the dictatorship.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMcGGMHWQAYJwkF?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Misinformation campaign is a weapon and war strategy from Russia. The state media RT does the same thing as China’s CCTV, to spread lies for the brutal regime and destabilize targets. Countries supporting freedom should consider banning state propaganda organs from operating.

The courage of Ukraine🇺🇦 changed the world’s attitude towards Putin. The protest in Hong Kong changed the world’s attitude towards Xi. Yet, we need change in action, in building a world that protects people from dictatorship. It’s been failing, and it’s time to stop the failure.

“Anyone who rejects military action as a last resort weakens the pressure that needs to be maintained on dictators and consequently makes a war not less but more likely.” <br>This is actually from 🇩🇪 former chancellor Merkel in 2003, before she came into power. Deterrence needed.
