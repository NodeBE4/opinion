Not sure why we continue to allow Chinese officials to use the platform they banned in the PRC to spread lies and stigmatization (with an Iphone).<br>Anyone overlooking the ongoing Crimes Against Humanities in Xinjiang, Tibet and suppression in Hong Kong is the colluder of dictators<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMRv8XmXMAA48SL?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

🇺🇦🏴<br>1. The documentary “Winter on Fire” has been a documentary Hong Kong protestors are watching. We  understand how it feels to have a threatening neighbour and people’s will being suppressed by authoritarian power.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMXEiDMWQAQ2SL6?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. Our Ukrainian friends have been supporting our struggles against dictatorship. It’s time that we support their fight. Talk to your Ukrainian friends, shop Ukrainian products, follow the news, and most importantly, urge the international community to act.<br>#StandWithUkraine<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMXDi3KWYAIgGK6?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

I want to pay my tribute to the protestors in Mosco and other cities in Russia — they have shown that not all nationals support dictators like Putin, Xi, and many others.<br>We all share the pain of living under a brutal regime. The fight is also ours, to end the dictatorship.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMcGGMHWQAYJwkF?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
