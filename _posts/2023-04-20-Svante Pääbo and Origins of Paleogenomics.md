拍攝日期：2023/01/09主講人：黃貞祥 （國立清華大學分子與細胞生物研究所助理教授）2022 Nobel laureate Svante Pääbo sequenced the genome of the Neanderthal, an extinct relative of present-day humans. He also made the sensational discovery of a previously unknown hominin, Denisova. He also found that gene transfer had occurred from these now-extinct hominins to Homo sapiens following the migration out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. This ancient flow of genes to present-day humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune system reacts to infections. I will talk about his seminal research which gave rise to an entirely new scientific discipline - paleogenomics. By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human.►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
