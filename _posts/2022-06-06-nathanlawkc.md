Attending #Time100 summit with my first #freedomshoe, designed and produced by Tibetan activist Khenzom. It combines our support for Ukraine and Hong Kong, and opposition against dictatorships. Hope leaders in this community can be more prepared to defend democracy.<br>@annakwokfy<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUq2WXdWAAAo99F?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
