### 167: [How the West Can Weaken Putin: Encourage Defections Among Soldiers and Diplomats](https://old.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/tqai79/how_the_west_can_weaken_putin_encourage/), submitted on 2022-03-28 22:26:47+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Stephen E. Biegun, Deputy Secretary of State from 2019 to 2021, and David J. Kramer, Managing Director for Global Policy at the George W. Bush Institute and a former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.\]

"The immediate focus of the United States and allies must be on the Russian military and diplomatic corps to encourage defections. Putin's orders are worthless if Russian soldiers and diplomats refuse to carry them out—if they recognize that the emperor has no clothes. Ultimately, the result might be that the emperor is no more."

\[SS from the article by Gideon Rose, Distinguished Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of *How Wars End*.\]

"The description of Putin’s mistakes is a decent summary of not just the earlier Soviet experience in Afghanistan but also much of U.S. national security policy over the last several decades, including the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Washington has repeatedly launched military interventions with extravagantly unrealistic expectations, overestimated its own capabilities and underestimated its opponents, believed it would be loved rather than hated, and thought it could put its favorites into office and then get away easily. And time and again, after running up against the same harsh realities as Putin, it has tried to bull its way forward before ultimately deciding to reverse course and withdraw.Yes, American motives were nobler. Yes, American methods were less brutal (most of the time). Yes, there were many other differences between the conflicts. But on a strategic level, the broad similarities are striking. This means there are several important lessons to be learned from recent American military history—but only if that history is looked at from the enemy’s perspective, not Washington’s. Because it was the enemies who won."

### 174: [The Perilous Long Game in Ukraine: Compromising With Putin May Be America’s Best Option](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ts81mc/the_perilous_long_game_in_ukraine_compromising/), submitted on 2022-03-30 22:45:06+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Samuel Charap, Senior Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation\]

"Policymakers in Washington must wrestle with two distinct kinds of goals. In the near term, U.S. priorities remain denying Putin a battlefield victory, avoiding the escalation of the conflict, and limiting its humanitarian and economic costs. Over the long term, the United States wants to shape Russian behavior in such a way that minimizes risks to U.S. geopolitical interests and international stability and reduces the potential for future regional conflict.

The main challenge today is that Ukraine’s brave resistance—even combined with ever-greater Western pressure on Moscow—is highly unlikely to overcome Russia’s military advantages, let alone topple Putin. Without some kind of deal with the Kremlin, the best outcome is probably a long, arduous war that Russia is likely to win anyway. And such a protracted conflict would cement the current extreme level of hostility between Russia and the West, undermining long-term U.S. interests in regional and global stability. It will be extremely hard, if not impossible, for the United States to achieve either its short- or long-term objectives if the war drags on for months longer. However distasteful it may be to reach a compromise with Putin after the carnage he has unleashed, the United States should work to secure a negotiated settlement to the conflict sooner rather than later."
