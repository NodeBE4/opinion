### 167: [How the West Can Weaken Putin: Encourage Defections Among Soldiers and Diplomats](https://old.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/tqai79/how_the_west_can_weaken_putin_encourage/), submitted on 2022-03-28 22:26:47+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Stephen E. Biegun, Deputy Secretary of State from 2019 to 2021, and David J. Kramer, Managing Director for Global Policy at the George W. Bush Institute and a former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.\]

"The immediate focus of the United States and allies must be on the Russian military and diplomatic corps to encourage defections. Putin's orders are worthless if Russian soldiers and diplomats refuse to carry them out—if they recognize that the emperor has no clothes. Ultimately, the result might be that the emperor is no more."
