### 395: [Are there any artifacts of ancient Japanese armor and weapons before Korean and Chinese influence, and if there isn't, how come? If there is, how did they compare to their neighbors of the time, and how would they have evolved differently if they weren't influenced by Korean and Chinese militaries?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ugg8yo/are_there_any_artifacts_of_ancient_japanese_armor/), submitted on 2022-05-02 11:09:49+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).
