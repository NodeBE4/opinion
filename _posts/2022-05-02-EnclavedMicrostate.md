### 395: [Suisei of Hololive fame brings up RWBY as an inspiration for her album cover](https://old.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/ug7txg/suisei_of_hololive_fame_brings_up_rwby_as_an/), submitted on 2022-05-02 03:50:59+08:00.

> As for saying the name wrong (LWBY)

Also that's probably just a translation mistake – Japanese doesn't necessarily have an /l/ sound as such and so loanwords and transliterations use syllables with 'r' to approximate it, so Suisei may have essentially overcompensated by rendering it as 'L'.

### 396: [Are there any artifacts of ancient Japanese armor and weapons before Korean and Chinese influence, and if there isn't, how come? If there is, how did they compare to their neighbors of the time, and how would they have evolved differently if they weren't influenced by Korean and Chinese militaries?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ugg8yo/are_there_any_artifacts_of_ancient_japanese_armor/), submitted on 2022-05-02 11:09:49+08:00.
