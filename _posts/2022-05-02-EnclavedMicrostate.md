### 395: [Suisei of Hololive fame brings up RWBY as an inspiration for her album cover](https://old.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/ug7txg/suisei_of_hololive_fame_brings_up_rwby_as_an/), submitted on 2022-05-02 03:50:59+08:00.

> As for saying the name wrong (LWBY)

Also that's probably just a translation mistake – Japanese doesn't necessarily have an /l/ sound as such and so loanwords and transliterations use syllables with 'r' to approximate it, so Suisei may have essentially overcompensated by rendering it as 'L'.

### 396: [Are there any artifacts of ancient Japanese armor and weapons before Korean and Chinese influence, and if there isn't, how come? If there is, how did they compare to their neighbors of the time, and how would they have evolved differently if they weren't influenced by Korean and Chinese militaries?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ugg8yo/are_there_any_artifacts_of_ancient_japanese_armor/), submitted on 2022-05-02 11:09:49+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf.

> Droids straight up form Napoleonic-style infantry blocks in combat

The thing of course is that these infantry blocks were mainly used to feed reserves into skirmish lines that performed the bulk of the firing, and to move in with the bayonet once the enemy formation was sufficiently depleted that it could be driven off the field. If you were going to be firing, you'd either send a skirmish force ahead, or form out in lines if you were trying to maximise fire. Blocks are not good for shooty action.

### 398: [Great Black Dragon](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseTranslation/comments/ugzvnt/great_black_dragon/), submitted on 2022-05-03 05:13:25+08:00.

In my view 黑 would also work – the Amur River, for instance, is also known as 黑龍江, so there's plenty of precedent for just using that. Also, seeing as it's supposed to be in Cantonese, tonally I'd argue *dai6 hak1 lung4* sounds better than *dai6 jyun4 lung4* – the latter has three low held tones while the former has a nice low-high-low contour.
