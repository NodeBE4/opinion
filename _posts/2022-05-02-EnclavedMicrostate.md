> As for saying the name wrong (LWBY)

Also that's probably just a translation mistake – Japanese doesn't necessarily have an /l/ sound as such and so loanwords and transliterations use syllables with 'r' to approximate it, so Suisei may have essentially overcompensated by rendering it as 'L'.

> Droids straight up form Napoleonic-style infantry blocks in combat

The thing of course is that these infantry blocks were mainly used to feed reserves into skirmish lines that performed the bulk of the firing, and to move in with the bayonet once the enemy formation was sufficiently depleted that it could be driven off the field. If you were going to be firing, you'd either send a skirmish force ahead, or form out in lines if you were trying to maximise fire. Blocks are not good for shooty action.

In my view 黑 would also work – the Amur River, for instance, is also known as 黑龍江, so there's plenty of precedent for just using that. Also, seeing as it's supposed to be in Cantonese, tonally I'd argue *dai6 hak1 lung4* sounds better than *dai6 jyun4 lung4* – the latter has three low held tones while the former has a nice low-high-low contour.

I did plan this week to write something original but didn't make the time in the end, so, er, it's repost time again! Yay!

Perhaps my favourite historical painting is [*The Yongzheng Emperor Hunting a Tiger*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Album_of_the_Yongzheng_Emperor_in_Costumes_8.jpg), composed by anonymous court painters at some point during his brief reign (1722-35). 

It's a fascinating portrait for a number of reasons, not least the fact that it depicts the emperor in an attempt at Western garb (modelled mainly on Louis XIII and XIV of France), and wielding a trident of uncertain design but definitely distinct from the single-broad-bladed Manchu tiger-hunting spear [(see here)](https://www.mandarinmansion.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/tiger-spears.jpg). The costume is probably the most immediately striking part, and suggests for one that the costume was not actually modelled for, and for another that there was minimal if any input from Jesuit courtiers, some of whom did see employment as court painters though most prominently under Yongzheng's son the Qianlong Emperor. In all likelihood, the painters only had a few Jesuit-sourced portrait busts for reference, which is reflected in the complete stylistic mangling the further down the costume goes: the waistcoat and overcoat become rather flappy below the waist, and are held together by a tied cord (similar to Japanese *haori*) instead of a leather belt, while the leg and footwear are of decidedly Sino-Manchurian style.

But the context is in many ways equally fascinating: this portrait forms part of what was originally a set of fourteen paintings, collated in an album titled, rather descriptively, *The Yongzheng Emperor in Costumes*, depicting the emperor in various garbs a various people, some mythic, some historical, some generic. On one level, the tiger-hunting portrait's depiction of the emperor as a French aristocrat is pretty par for the course in an album that also portrays him, among other things, as a Tibetan lama in meditation, a Persian archer hunting birds, a Daoist magician summoning a dragon, and a Chinese fisherman daydreaming on the shore. But what makes it weird is that the act of tiger-hunting does have some significance in Chinese religious art: one of the eighteen Arhats in Chinese Buddhism (and one of two to be added to the ranks of the previously sixteen Arhats in the late Tang), often associated with Maitreya, is also known as Subduing-Tiger or Taming-Tiger, and depictions of Maitreya subduing a tiger were relatively common as a motif in this part of the Qing. What we have then is a fascinatingly weird blend of established Chinese Buddhism with Qing multiculturalism to... uncertain effect.

One aspect to consider is that although the Yongzheng Emperor subscribed to a relatively assimilationist approach to identity and ethnicity and more or less allowed cultural erosion in the Banners while supporting efforts at colonial expansion in southwest China and Taiwan, he nevertheless continued some of the multifaceted imperial expression associated more strongly with his predecessor and his successor. The depiction of him in a variety of different outfits, even if skewing towards Han elites (at least three of the fourteen portraits show him as a Chinese scholar), is a particularly striking, but also quite private expression of that sort of self-image. Another is that the Yongzheng Emperor was never formally designated the heir apparent, leaving his succession to the throne open to some degree of question. Association with the great monarchs of France may, like the use of Western-style cartography and portraiture by other emperors, have been seen as an alternative, external language of power that could bolster legitimacy to some extent. Or, perhaps, there is the rather strange fact that a Kangxi-era woodblock album, *Fifty-Three Transformation Bodies of Guanyin*, rather inexplicably included an image of a European aristocrat, reminiscent of Louis XIII, as a depiction of one of the aspects of the boddhisatva Avalokitasvara, giving the Bourbon-inspired garb another roundabout religious significance of its own. 

This was not the only portrait the emperor had made of himself in imitation French garb, as there is also a portrait bust of him in similar though differently-coloured wig and clothing, though I thought the more animated portrait was more interesting. I basically concur with Sun Jing's argument that these portraits were an attempt to satiate a personal curiosity about Europeans, trying to create a 'view from within' by having himself placed in the position of one of them, as well as demonstrating the legitimacy of the 'universal empire' by having him portray figures from both within and beyond its borders.

Most of the above is sourced from Sun Jing's chapter in Thijs Weststeijn (ed.), *Foreign Devils and Philosophers: Cultural Encounters between the Chinese, the Dutch, and Other Europeans, 1590-1800*.
