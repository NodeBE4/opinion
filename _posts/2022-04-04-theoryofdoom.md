### 209: [Republican-controlled states have higher murder rates than Democratic ones: study](https://old.reddit.com/r/crime/comments/twuqpj/republicancontrolled_states_have_higher_murder/), submitted on 2022-04-05 21:17:22+08:00.

This is an article about a "study" from a partisan group called Third Way, which was linked several paragraphs in.  According to the article:

> The study found that murder rates in the 25 states Trump carried in 2020 are 40% higher overall than in the states Biden won. 

The "study" only used 2020 data "because 2021 data is not yet fully available."  However, the study purportedly focuses on a so called "[Red State Murder Problem](https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-red-state-murder-problem)," generally, not 2020 homicide rates in particular.  The study in fact made no effort whatsoever to evaluate relative crime rates of red states at any point *before* 2020 and there are serious questions as to the reliability of the incomplete dataset they purportedly derived their analysis from.  

Beyond the obvious, this "study" provided no explanation as to why they failed to consider data *before* 2020, and specifically why they limited their inquiry of states based on 2020 presidential election results by ignoring everything before that time.  No explanation is provided as to why they failed to account for different presidential electoral outcomes going back the last several elections.  And of course, no explanation is suggested, much less offered, as to what if any relationship any such election results had in relation to these purported figures.

The above deficits are an illustrative sampling of why this Yahoo article and the purported "study" on which it is based are inexcusably deficient.  These deficiencies are obvious, impossible to ignore and can be readily ascertained by anyone who even casually review the claims proposed.  Obvious inferences with respect to bias cannot be ignored.  In the best case, these authors are inexcusably incompetent.  In the worst case, this falls squarely within the category of deliberately misleading partisan hackery.  The latter is more likely, however, given the surrounding facts and circumstances.  

Accordingly, this article is removed.  We encourage submissions from reliable think tanks and sources, but Third Way is no such thing when they publish this kind of nonsense.
