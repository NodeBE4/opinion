Viewed by nearly 90% of China's one billion internet users, short videos are the rage. Hoping to ride the wave and change minds, CCP propaganda leaders are rewarding the promotion of Party agendas at home and abroad through the popular medium. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/18/streaming-the-china-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/18/streaming-the-china-story/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJYexeGaIAU5Crg?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Dutch media have reported in the last 24 hours that the Cross-Cultural Human Rights Centre (CCHRC) at Free University, a public research university, has received between 250,000 and 300,00 euros per year in 2018, 2019 and 2020. <a href="https://www.nieuwsnos.nl/nieuws/binnenland/china-financiert-onderzoek-naar-mensenrechten-bij-de-vu-61e81bb9787b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nieuwsnos.nl/nieuws/binnenland/china-financiert-onderzoek-naar-mensenrechten-bij-de-vu-61e81bb9787b8</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJgLmPxacAAx3PF?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re CCHRC content is strikingly in line with the CCP line, though Zwart insists he "is able to operate independently despite the funding from China." Here is a "news" piece attacking the Summit for Democracy and linking to China's foreign ministry. <a href="https://crossculturalhumanrightscentre.com/?page_id=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://crossculturalhumanrightscentre.com/?page_id=12</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJgOOT2aIAMARaX?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Notice the site reads: "Opinions expressed in the blogs do not necessarily express the opinions of the CCHRC, but have been added here after careful selection." How carefully?

Re Scholars and their supposed independence aside, it is clear that the Free University has tangled itself in a web of external influence operations over the issue of human rights. For a further hint of the complex circles leading back to Beijing, consider this:
