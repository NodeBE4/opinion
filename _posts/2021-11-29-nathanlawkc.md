It's hypocritical to counter "anti-Asian hate" but defend China's human rights record. Millions of Uyghurs are suffering in concertion camps now. They can only get away from it by equating "criticizing China" to "advancing US imperialism." <br>I can't even explain how lame it is.<br><br>Fiona Edwards: The cold war warriors/lackeys of US imperialism are spreading fake news about yesterday's successful and peaceful ANTI-RACIST rally in London's Chinatown.<br><br>150 people attended.

My deepest gratitude to @GretaThunberg for her hand-writing letter to my friend @joshuawongcf, who has been jailed for over a year.
