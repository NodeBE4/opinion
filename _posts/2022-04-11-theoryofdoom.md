A source would be helpful here, if you can find one.

Don't be obstinate.  This is what you wrote:

Get a source.

### 217: [I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Probability Theory, and have an issue with retaining methods I used a while ago.](https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/u2302q/im_currently_pursuing_a_phd_in_probability_theory/), submitted on 2022-04-13 00:23:31+08:00.

You are never going to actually retain the method just by reading it.  And even if you can conceptualize it in some level of abstraction after reading a book or article about it, you'll forget it a week later unless you repeatedly apply it.  

So, the solution is repeated application.  If you learn a new method, try to apply it.  Then try to apply it in another context.  Then try to apply it in another context.  Do this over and over again.  Or at least think through how you would apply it; work it out, or at least work out how you would work it out, whether in your head or on paper.  

But try to actually apply it.  Then tear apart why you probably applied it wrong and start over.  Then try to re-do it.  Then tear it apart and try to improve.  Lather, rinse and repeat.

> It’s definitely true that many applied statisticians take that approach, but many statisticians are also very concerned with establishing rigor of our methods! 

Shout it from the rooftops.

This is critically important to realize, even given the obvious problems associated with counting absolute rates of positives (which you and I'm sure many others have discussed on many occasions).  

Taking longer views helps keeps things in perspective.
