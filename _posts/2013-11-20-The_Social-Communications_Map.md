   I took another turn at my map of the social networking space I made for yesterday’s post
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/multitudes-social/">
    The Multitudes of Social
   </a>
   :

   I made a few changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The primary change is relabeling the horizontal axis.
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/multitudes-social/">
     Originally
    </a>
    I had “Interest/Topic-
    <br>
     Based” on the left, and “Real-life Relationship-Based” on the right, but as Victor Pope pointed out
     <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jaggedcow/status/402671689529442304">
      on Twitter
     </a>
     , the real difference is really about the symmetry of relationships.
    </br>
   </li>
   <li>
    Relabeling this axis necessitated moving email and Skype to the right, which I think makes sense and is an indication that this is a a good change.
   </li>
   <li>
    I added Tumblr and YouTube, and removed Photostream and Facetime. The original was based on networks I personally use; this new drawing is more representative of usage worldwide. I did leave LINE, but consider that representative of WhatsApp, Kik, Kakao Talk, WeChat, etc.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Finally, I’ve changed the title to make the broader point: social is about communication, and communication is, and always has been, conducted through multiple mediums.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some additional observations, beyond Facebook and Snapchat (which were the focus of the
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/multitudes-social/">
    original post
   </a>
   ):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    There are three primary means of communication: text, photo, and video/voice. Usually a particular service, beyond competing in a specific quadrant, will also specialize in one of these mediums, and then grow into an adjacent medium over time (e.g. Instagram video).
