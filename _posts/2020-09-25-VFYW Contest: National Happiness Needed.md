I just showed my wife that Dingle view, and she said &#8220;Ireland,&#8221; which was slightly closer than my guess. So based on her performance, I asked for her guess this week. She said it looked like Kyoto. So I&#8217;m guessing Kyoto, Japan. (We stayed at the Westin Miyako Kyoto and the highlight for us was Ry&#333;an-ji, the Zen temple.)</p></blockquote><p>Only 2,674 miles off this time. This next reader is too hard on himself:</p><blockquote><p>First time player, long time loser. Is it the Ore Inn in Jiufen, Taiwan?</p></blockquote><p>Another reader goes with another island nation:</p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;m fairly certain this is in Indonesia. The first indication was the architecture.&nbsp;The second was the red-and-white sign on which &#8220;PONRI&#8221; can be made out &#8212; that&#8217;s the acronym for the Indonesian Police.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s actually &#8220;PELRI,&#8221; according to a half-dozen readers with better sight than mine. Another notes, &#8220;a nearby roof has letters spray painted on top that say &#8216;I LOVE BHU.&#8217;&#8221; Banaras Hindu University? Maybe. This reader jumps to the mainland:</p><blockquote><p>This looks like the beautiful Cameron Highlands in Malaysia, a place I briefly visited in 1988 while backpacking around Southeast Asia. I recall visiting a tea plantation but not much else.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a large tourist area with a number of settlements, but I&#8217;ll go with the town of Brinchang.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another reader heads north:</p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s clearly a hill station in northern India but I&#8217;ve exhausted all the ones I know and can&#8217;t find it! AHhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another frustrated reader:</p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve searched India, Spain, Canary Islands, Columbia, Costa Rica, and on and on and on &#8230; so many of them have homes very close to those in the photo, but not quite right. I&#8217;ll choose&nbsp;Zhangmu, Tibet:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-594-950" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f29ddca-9b93-4a80-bedb-3f82929132fb_950x594.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f29ddca-9b93-4a80-bedb-3f82929132fb_950x594.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f29ddca-9b93-4a80-bedb-3f82929132fb_950x594.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:594,&quot;width&quot;:950,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:353173,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-594-950 {            padding-bottom: 62.526315789473685%;            padding-bottom: min(62.526315789473685%, 594px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-594-950 img {            max-width: 950px;            max-height: 594px;          }        </style></a><p>I know it&#8217;s not right, but I&#8217;m stumped yet again &#8230;</p></blockquote><p>This reader gets to the right country:</p><blockquote><p>It has to be the mountain kingdom&nbsp;of <strong>Bhutan</strong>. There are so many tantalizing&nbsp;clues, such as the monastery on the hill above, the unusual outdoor&nbsp;gym to the right, and the infuriating red-and-white sign that I think ends in &#8220;Pelri&#8221;? The Hotel Phuntso Pelri in Thimphu has remarkably&nbsp;similar architecture, but I don&#8217;t think&nbsp;it&#8217;s the same building &#8230;</p><p>I have to send this email so I stop digging&nbsp;into this one &#8212; my head hurts! Perhaps my focus on Thimphu has me in the wrong city entirely, but it&#8217;s my birthday today so I&#8217;m hoping for an honorable&nbsp;mention.</p></blockquote><p>Happy birthday! Some celebratory balloons are at the bottom of this post. Another Thimphu guesser:</p><blockquote><p>I was initially thrown off by the deciduous trees in the photo, since Bhutan is mountainous and cold. But after finding <a href="https://bhutanfound.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/School-Design-Guidelines-2020.pdf">official guidelines for Bhutanese school design</a>, I discovered that schools often make use of deciduous trees to help block the sun in the summer and permit it in the winter.

The architectural elements are repeated all over the country. After looking two or three times at all the temple-like structures in Thimphu &#8212; the country&#8217;s capital and largest city &#8212; I came to accept that none of them matched the Dzong seen in the window. And most of the other of the ten largest cities looked far too sparse. The only thing left to do was power through all the towns in Bhutan &#8230;</p><p>And there was <strong>Mongar</strong>, a little pocket of an urban city.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Pop. 3,502.

One of them provides some great background on Bhutan:</p><blockquote><p>The architecture of Bhutanese apartments is immediately recognizable to anyone, like my son, who has been to Bhutan. Nearly&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;apartment building in the entire country seems to have the same basic range of elements: retail on the ground floor (usually behind an arcade); three or four floors of apartments above;&nbsp;stucco walls painted either white or in a tight range of pale colors; windows with beautiful decorative wood frames, sometimes with medallions between them; and always pitched metal seam roofs that are either red, green or silver with large projecting eaves. There are no all-glass buildings, or Modern buildings with flat roofs, or multifaceted, curved structures. There is definitely no Bhutanese Bloomberg encouraging developers to build apartment towers many floors taller than their neighbors. &nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ve included an image from TripAdvisor showing the interior of a similar room with the&nbsp;same view: </p><a class="image-link image2 image2-931-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68988224-9c71-4054-b497-6b10b9bc2a76_1978x1265.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68988224-9c71-4054-b497-6b10b9bc2a76_1978x1265.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/68988224-9c71-4054-b497-6b10b9bc2a76_1978x1265.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:931,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:405033,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-931-1456 {            padding-bottom: 63.942307692307686%;            padding-bottom: min(63.942307692307686%, 931px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-931-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 931px;          }        </style></a><p>Typically the&nbsp;decorative wood frames are independent of the operable glass windows &#8212; sort of like shutters.&nbsp;I&#8217;m assuming our photographer opened the inner glass window and took the photo with only the edge of outer frame&nbsp;visible. That would explain why there&#8217;s no glass in the photo.</p><p>Regarding the open-air gym equipment next to the pavilion, it turns out in 2016 the World Health Organization provided to Bhutan&#8217;s Ministry of Health over 700 pieces of all-weather gym equipment as part of Bhutan&#8217;s effort to reduce&nbsp;non-communicable diseases &#8212; obesity and related issues &#8212; and to promote a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, it turns out there is no list of where the gym equipment went, only&nbsp;anecdotes that it started to fall apart after a year of heavy use and there were no funds for repairs. To add to the degree of&nbsp;difficulty in finding the gyms, in Bhutan the Google Earth imagery was captured in 2013 &#8212; before the WHO program started &#8212; so the equipment&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t show up there.

In 2018, a town on Bhutan&#8217;s border with India, Pashaka, was ranked 2nd in the world&#8217;s most polluted cities.&nbsp;It&#8217;s not all bad news, however, as Bhutan has made incredible strides in&nbsp;<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/bhutans-unique-success-in-reducing-poverty/">reducing the percentage</a>&nbsp;of residents living in poverty.</p><p>In any event, I had a lot of fun puzzling out this contest.
