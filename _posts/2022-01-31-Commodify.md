### 56: [How does South Korea, Japan, and China view the North Korean Military?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/sgtkyz/how_does_south_korea_japan_and_china_view_the/), submitted on 2022-01-31 13:38:43+08:00.

Japan - Japan perceives hardly any threat from the DPRK and the ruling party trumps up the missile threat primarily as part of its campaign to abolish Article 7 of the Japanese constitution. If war broke out on the Korean peninsula, the only threat that Japan could face is nuclear missiles, but the country has the most robust missile defense system in the region, South Korea is a higher priority target, and North Korea's missiles are not numerous enough to oversaturate Japan's defenses. The primary Japanese target in a war would be the American base at Okinawa, but the US has significant missile defense assets there as well.

A parallel security threat exists in the form of a network of North Korean infiltrators and commandos that has existed in Japanese society since the Korean War. The Chongryon Association, formerly the main Korean association in Japan, mobilizes resentment over decades of discrimination to turn Korean-Japanese towards the North. Through Chongryon, North Korea has been able to assert undercover operators into Japanese society and conduct kidnappings and covert operations. Due to the prominence of the sleeper commando in North Korean military thought, the main threat to Japan in the event of a war will probably be these commandos attacking key targets like nuclear power plants, the power grid, and so on, based on Japan's degree of response. Partly because of this and partly because their help would probably be counterproductive (making North Korea seem like the "nationalist" side of the war), there are no JSDF plans to deploy on the Korean peninsula even if Japan is attacked.

South Korea - South Korea does not see the North as weak but does see it as a known commodity. Due to extensive diplomatic conflicts, a brinksmanship crisis every four years, and its intelligence network, South Korea believes with good reason that it "knows" the North and therefore also knows that it will not attack. South Korea conceives of the North as a rational actor. While its social system and totalitarianism seem insane to the outside world, it should be noted that the DPRK essentially follows traditional Korean governance with Communist wrapping paper: the Joseon dynasty also had tyrannical Kings, frequent palace purges, rigid social classes, and extreme centralization. Such a state nevertheless possesses the capacity to act rationally, and has this capacity to an even *greater* degree than all the other powers in North Asia: with total control of people's minds, the DPRK can't be "blown to war" by the winds of public opinion. It has demonstrated its ability to be peaceful even during the "Arduous March", the country's darkest years.

The South nevertheless prepares for war. The US-South Korean defense plan before the 1970s was to defend the Han River, abandoning half of Seoul in the process. They shifted to a border defense in those years, with the US adopting OPLAN 5027. This OPLAN essentially makes American soldiers "tripwires" for North Korea to kill, forcing the American public to go to war - a major concern in the post-Vietnam era. DPRK command doubled down on its artillery park in those years, developing the formidable M-1978 Koksan and drilling perhaps the most competent towed artillery counterbattery crews in the world. Though in the age of SPA, this claim to fame is like being the best featherweight boxer. 

The South Korean strategy in the event of a war is, contra popular belief, offensive. A defensive war will take place in South Korea's most valuable and populous regions, so it's important the war ends quickly through a sudden strike. The "stupid" South Korean carriers are the smartest investment the country ever made. Ever since it acquired independent naval capability, South Korea has been gearing to perform maritime landings behind North Korean lines, and North Korea has been preparing to stop them with a swarm of small boats and permanent garrisons (complete with *fixed* artillery) in Pyongyang. 

South Korea is aware it will win the war against the North, the question is just at what cost. A Korean war the way most imagine it would lead to South Korea becoming a second world country, dependent on the US and China for protection. Such a strategy would probably also not lead to unification, because China will no doubt deploy to protect Pyongyang once the Northern army falters. Beijing would then only allow reunification when American troops leave the peninsula, and would be the only power with the financial resources to help South Korea rebuild. In other words, the "pop" version of the Second Korean War results in South Korea becoming a protectorate. The ROK needs to win quickly, and knows this.

ROK also has a deep understanding of North Korean military doctrine, which values aggression, deployment at close range, and attack from all sides. By some estimates the DPRK has thousands of commandos sleeping in the South to conduct attacks in the rear, and more than a dozen still active invasion tunnels for the same. ROK intelligence is constantly looking for these people, but that's a very hard thing to do in a populous modern country.

China - While the outlook of South Korea and Japan towards the DPRK are strategically defensive (as in accepting and trying to preserve the status quo), China's approach is strategically offensive. China has been trying to overthrow the Kim family and turn North Korea into a protectorate for decades. Once this is done, it can trade the DPRK to South Korea in exchange for American troops leaving and fully exploit the country's rich natural resources to fuel its titanic, hungry industrial base. On a less sinister note, aside from the ROK government no one is more fed up with the antics of the Kim family than the CCP. Almost immediately after Chinese withdrawal from the DPRK, the Kim family purged the pro-Chinese Yanan faction and aligned strongly with the USSR for most of the remainder of the Cold War. During the Sino-Soviet War scare, it was intimately clear to the Chinese that a Sino-Soviet War would escalate into a Sino-Korean war, as North Korea would try to reclaim Balhae, re-establish ancient Goguryeo and cut Chinese forces in Manchuria off from the rest of the country by sealing off the Shanhai pass.

Wait what are all these words you might ask? In ancient times what is now Northeast China was part of Korea, captured from the Northern Korean kingdom of Goguryeo by the Tang. These lands - more populous and valuable than North Korea itself - were actually the heart of the ancient Korean civilization (!). It is a common ambition of Korean nationalists in North and South to reclaim these lands, and there are still millions of Koreans living there. The North, being the more traditional and nationalistic of the two Koreas, is actually the less palatable Korea for China to deal with, despite being a military ally and a fellow Communist country. The Chinese and South Korean governments are in fact on better terms, though that is not to say they have no disagreements. While both want the Kim family to be replaced, the ROK government is not happy with the enthusiasm with which Beijing pursues this goal - any conflict will reap far more damage on the South than on China, so their incentives are different.

The most recent Chinese attempt to depose the Kims happened in 2012. Following the death of Kim Jong Il, China assisted their main ally in Pyongyang, Jang Song-thaek, in consolidating power under his "Korean Workers' Party Administrative Department". For a year, Jang ruled North Korea as regent and signaled a more moderate tone (which foreign press falsely attributed to Kim Jong-il). He freed tens of thousands of political prisoners (many of them also part of his moderate and Sinophiliac faction) and made frequent liasons with Beijing. But as we know, his story ended poorly and Kim regained control. He did this with the help of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the country's main intelligence network: its commander, Kim Yong Chol (no relation) subsequently became his right hand man.

After the coup and the purge that followed, China scrambled to find alternative candidates for leadership. Kim Jong-un's brother, Kim Jong-nam, was something of a loser and was never a real candidate, but nevertheless was a client of Jang Song-thaek through his patronage network in the Malaysian embassy. The RGB assassinated him in 2017. That same year, Kim Jong-nam's son, Kim Han-sol, rebased to Beijing, where police foiled an RGB attempt to assassinate him too. No doubt, Chinese intelligence was putting out feelers to replace Jong-un with Han-sol, or at the very least intended to use him as a bargaining chip with Pyongyang. However, Kim Jong-un was successful at consolidating his regime and Beijing evidently abandoned this scheme by 2020, when it was reported Kim Han-sol had transferred to American protective custody.

The main military operations China plans for in North Korea is an offensive operation to secure political advantages in a Korean crisis. The Beijing and Shenyang military regions, spanning China's Northeast, remain the two most important and heavily armed PLA MRs, despite Russia having long flipped from an enemy to an ally. This indicates that Beijing takes the prospect of this operation very seriously. North Korea moreover has millions of troops in the Northern half of the country facing China. Any Chinese advance into North Korea would be spearheaded by the Siberian Tigers, the Shenyang Military Region's own special forces unit trained for mountain warfare. Like the US and South Korea, China maintains a sizable amphibious force in the region as well, supported by a carrier battle group and five tank landing ships in the Yellow Sea. The total lift capacity of this fleet is actually roughly equal to that of the entire ROK Navy.

In the past, there were two possible operations where this force could be deployed without fighting the entire KPA. The first was a political struggle where China intervened to back its faction, and the second is a Korean war where China lands troops in Pyongyang and charges down the peninsula to "save" the North (and implicitly replace Kim with someone more amenable). Today, only the second remains a possibility. China wants to avoid open conflict with the DPRK in all other circumstances. Victory in either operation implicitly meant the end of the DPRK, as the entire country would be used as a bargaining chip with South Korea to evict American troops from the peninsula. China's goal today is not to preserve a militarized, officially aligned Communist state. It's to disarm the Korean peninsula, remove a potential threat, and revert Korea to its status of being a loosely aligned "hermit Kingdom" tied to China by trade and antipathy for Japan.
This all begs the question of why China didn't conduct this trade in the two periods where it was "possible". The first was 1953-57, when North Korea was essentially a Chinese puppet ruled by the Yanan faction, and the second was during the arduous march when Kim Jong-il was totally dependent on Chinese aid to survive. In the first period "reunification for departure" was not desirable since China's mindset was different. It had just emerged from a century of wars against Western coalitions and its primary focus was "expelling the barbarians" from Asia. Intra-party debates of the era centered around how many millions of men in how many lines were required to repel an American invasion that Mao & co. believed was very likely, and what percentage of the population needed to have access to firearms to conduct a guerrilla war. Providing aid to North Korea, Vietnam, and other "frontlines against the West" was such a priority that it continued even during the Great Famine. It was not until America started to lose the Vietnam War and Sino-Soviet relations became downright hostile that China believed the barbarians had been sufficiently expelled. Its relations with North Korea subsequently worsened.

In the second period, China did not push for reunification for similar security concerns. After the fall of the USSR, the CCP lived through "two decades of insecurity" where their obsolete military machine could easily have been defeated by an American pre-emptive attack, and where its economy was still reliant on exports to grow. In these years, China sought to make itself a "useful member of the American world order" by providing services to the metropole. It joined the war on terror, bought trillions in American bonds, and actually liked the fact that Kim Jong-il was stirring up so much trouble: Beijing had the key role to play in the Five Party Talks and took full advantage of America's lack of priorities (trying to depose Kim instead of curtail its rising rival) to forestall what it perceived as an inevitable American attack. China's outlook on North Korea only shifted from encouraging its misbehavior to cracking down on it in the 2010s, by which time exports as a percent of GDP had declined by half and military strength had greatly improved.

Just as importantly, Kim Jong-il played his cards right. Amid economic collapse, Kim paradoxically placed all resources in the hands of the military and gambled that Beijing would give him just enough aid to stay afloat. The gamble worked. Aware that a war would probably involve China, destroy the East Asian financial market, and lead to an even greater American presence in the region, Beijing had effectively no ability to use aid as a "lever" against Kim, as it would only be a lever against itself. Jong-il, unlike Jong-un, attempted to appease Beijing where possible and it was under his rule that Jang and his "second Yanan faction" rose.
