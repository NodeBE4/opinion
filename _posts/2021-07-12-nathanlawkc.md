Football has many sides. One is about competition, one is connection. Though I am not competitive, I played football in a few countries. Teammates with diversity are instantly connected. A common language and joys are shared. I love this side of football, not the one with hatred.

Turned 28 today and grateful for all the support received in the past year.
