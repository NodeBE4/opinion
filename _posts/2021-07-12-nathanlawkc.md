Football has many sides. One is about competition, one is connection. Though I am not competitive, I played football in a few countries. Teammates with diversity are instantly connected. A common language and joys are shared. I love this side of football, not the one with hatred.

Turned 28 today and grateful for all the support received in the past year. Will continue to be a voice of Hong Kong, and urge the world to build a stronger global democracy.<br>🎂🎉<br>#StandWithHongKong<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6MHr5TXsAgkZZZ?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
