### 755: [Did John Glenn go to space while serving as a Senator, and is he the only politician ever to do so?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wzztho/did_john_glenn_go_to_space_while_serving_as_a/), submitted on 2022-08-29 00:39:43+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 756: [It is AskHistorians' ELEVENTH BIRTHDAY! As is tradition, you may be jocular and/or slightly cheeky in this thread!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wzztsi/it_is_askhistorians_eleventh_birthday_as_is/), submitted on 2022-08-29 00:40:03+08:00.

----- __756.1__ -----2022-08-29 01:00:08+08:00:

Terrifying to imagine that AskHistorians is now a tween!

I can't claim to have discovered them for particularly amazing reasons, purely that we apparently share VTuber oshis.

### 757: [Kobo Regis stream that that keeps on giving](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/x00hwc/kobo_regis_stream_that_that_keeps_on_giving/), submitted on 2022-08-29 01:09:00+08:00.

> Noel has shifted some attention to Shuba

This can be a bit misunderstood – to paraphrase Noel herself, ['Subaru is my oshi, Flare is *[kiss noises]*.'](https://youtu.be/4TaTV1EQ2Zs?t=482)

----- __757.2__ -----2022-08-29 13:40:14+08:00:

You might be conflating it a bit with Nijisanji's Tomoe and Kana (aka Crossick), who have quite publicly tried to downplay the existence of a ship dynamic at least at present. Noel and Flare definitely dropped aspects that were being 'played up for the camera' so to speak around this time last year, but they've not really overtly said to cut it out the way Kiara did.

### 758: [At what point were the Nazis completely “gone”? Are they even gone?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/x0eloo/at_what_point_were_the_nazis_completely_gone_are/), submitted on 2022-08-29 11:42:16+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it violates our ['20-Year Rule'](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events). To discourage off-topic discussions of current events, questions, answers, and all other comments must be confined to events that happened 20 years ago or more. For further explanation of this rule, feel free to consult [this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glj8c4/rules_roundtable_xii_the_twenty_year_rule/).

### 759: [Does the Soviet Union bear more responsibility for WWII?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/x0fsdy/does_the_soviet_union_bear_more_responsibility/), submitted on 2022-08-29 12:44:58+08:00.

----- __759.1__ -----2022-08-29 13:42:41+08:00:

This question has been removed because it is [soapboxing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or otherwise a [loaded question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/): it has the effect of promoting an existing interpretation or opinion at the expense of open-ended enquiry. Although we understand if you may have an existing interest in the topic, expressing a detailed opinion on the matter in your question is usually a sign that it is a loaded one, and we will remove questions that appear to put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.

### 760: [Many former British colonies, especially in Oceania, South Asia, and the Carribbean, are quite keen – to say the least – on cricket, and consistently perform very well at the international level. Why is this not also the case for Canada?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/x0olcj/many_former_british_colonies_especially_in/), submitted on 2022-08-29 21:19:09+08:00.

Ah, thanks for the link, and thanks u/McFoodBot!

----- __760.2__ -----2022-08-29 23:51:15+08:00:

Thanks! The point about white vs minority experiences is an especially appreciated one.
