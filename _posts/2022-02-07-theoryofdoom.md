### 74: [Illinois school mask mandate ruling puts districts on spot to enforce or make optional](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/smdqvo/illinois_school_mask_mandate_ruling_puts/), submitted on 2022-02-07 09:37:04+08:00.

> If he doesn't appeal the decision, he admits the mandates were illegal and the campaign ads write themselves.

If he does appeal, he loses the suburbs and any prospect at re-election. Politically, he has no choice but to try to preempt the impact by standing down.  That mitigates the harm of his political loss.  Pritzker should have dropped the mask mandates a long time ago.

As an aside, the cohort of highly vocal people on reddit who use language like "anti-maskers" (as if someone who opposed masks was some kind of analogue of the stereotypical "anti-vaxxer") are hardly representative of where the general public is on this issue, in Illinois or nationally.

> I don’t know. Pritzker seems like he’s willing to die on this hill, despite most Democratic governors not reinstating mask mandates at the state level. He’ll double down as long as he thinks he’ll be re-elected or until Newsom and Hochul tell him that he’s being unreasonable.

I disagree with this.  Pritzker is neither particularly competent nor resolute.  He's going to respond to the politics, which have formed the basis of his so-called "COVID mitigation strategy."  And the politics favor change.  

He'll still lose re-election, however.  Even Churchill was thrown out after WWII.  He will be no different.  Any candidate as credible as Bruce Rauner or better will defeat him.

> It's that if this sets off a shockwave, and infections rise dramatically, it'd cause more undue strain on the healthcare system.

The lack of masks or mandated masking has had no effect whatsoever in the southern states and many others in the mountain-west region.  Nor has the presence of masks or mandated masking appreciably reduced community spread in enclosed buildings, in anywhere such "mitigations" have been enforced.  There are variables which influence community spread in enclosed buildings, like ventilation, but no one seems concerned about that anymore.

We'll see how long he keeps this charade up.

> I’m not so sure they can coalesce around a center-right, Trump-distanced candidate who can win over moderates in the collar counties.

Outside of Chicago, Springfield, Urbana-Champaign and (to some extent) Rockford, Illinois is pretty red.  I think they'll all prefer any Republican over Pritzker, even if the one they get is more like Mitt Romney than Josh Hawley.

### 75: [Gov. Pritzker Gives No Specific Metrics For Removing COVID-19 Mask Mandate, But Says It Will Depend On Hospitalizations](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/sn3xy7/gov_pritzker_gives_no_specific_metrics_for/), submitted on 2022-02-08 07:07:06+08:00.

Source?  Not saying I don't believe you but I'd like to see something establishing as much.

----- __75.2__ -----2022-02-08 11:28:27+08:00:

Ok, well I've seen some conflicting information on that but it happens in a couple of days so we'll see.

> I’m a diehard democrat and I am firmly anti mask mandate at this point. Most of my friends are the same way.

Same, for the most part.  Outside of the democrats I know in the 250k+ income bracket, the majority have been so repulsed by the way this pandemic has been handled they will never vote for another democrat again.  Most are afraid to admit it outside of the folks they know share those thoughts, but they're done.  They don't like Republicans and they don't want to see the GOP establishment, but almost without exception they think they miscalculated the lesser of two evils.  Even the most progressive types I've seen in Chicago have had enough.

----- __75.4__ -----2022-02-08 11:44:28+08:00:

I guess we'll see.  I don't know.

----- __75.5__ -----2022-02-08 12:19:52+08:00:

> there's no defending Pritzker's inability to provide any concrete roadmap for ending restrictions at this stage of the pandemic.

I don't know that there's "no" defending.  Practically, there is no medical or epidemiologic threshold that establishes when the pandemic is over.  So it has to be a political decision.  The bottom line is that he wants to be able to pull the plug when the politics make it expedient to do so, he can't if he commits himself to a specific threshold.  The bright side is that his free-floating and unbounded approach gives him political flexibility.  The dark side is that it's pretty transparently not based on anything objective and non-political. 

Not saying I'd do the same thing.  But it's not like I don't understand what he's up to.

----- __75.6__ -----2022-02-08 12:32:01+08:00:

> Pritzker is so guaranteed to win he can stick to his precious masks without any fear.

I don't think Pritzker has any ideological commitment to masks, mandates or any of the "mitigations" he's implemented.  Nor do I think he especially desires to maintain them.  But he doesn't want to pay the price of what will happen if he drops them and then, for whatever reason, cases/hospitalizations rise.  

It won't matter from a data-driven perspective whether the policy change caused or contributed in any way to any subsequent increase.  The by-line is going to be: "Pritzker drops mandate.  Hospitalizations skyrocket!"  That's what he's avoiding.  If hospitalizations skyrocket under circumstances where "mitigations" are in place, then he tells the public he did all he could.  But if they skyrocket after he drops them?  He'll be filleted like a cheap pollock.  

The concept of "hospitalizations or cases as measured by PCR and/or antigen tests" vary independently from policy measures intended to "contain" or "slow the spread" is just too much for the public to grasp.  This is going to be understood at the level of "Bush lied!  People died!"  That's what Pritzker is worried about --- which I guess he should be, given his "leadership style."

I obviously would have handled things differently.  But that's irrelevant, just like every other opinion I have on what he should have done lol.  I'm just some random guy on Reddit.

----- __75.7__ -----2022-02-08 12:46:39+08:00:

I really do think Pritzker is trying to do the best he can.  I just think that he like most politicians cannot tell the difference between science and quackery, a problem that is neither new nor unique to the current pandemic.  

I'm reminded of when eugenics was all the rage about 100 years ago.  So, just outside of living memory in Buck v. Bell, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote this:

> We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.

This is one of the darkest chapters in American legal history, brought about by a set of folks who thought that giving the government the power to do things in service of "public health" was a good thing.  

As a result, thousands of people were involuntarily sterilized in this country based on pseudoscience; the kind of crackpot quackery that is more properly suited for American Horror Story than the annals of American jurisprudence. 

Holmes was no fool, either.  He is one of the most gifted jurists the country has ever seen.  And yet, we have this.  If Holmes could be taken in to this extent by something this egregious, how much better could be expected from JB, who only got into Northwestern because of his family's money?  Not much.

The thing to take away from this --- at least in my opinion, for what little it's worth as just some random guy on Reddit --- is that we really ought to be considering what kind of relationship we want to have with the state.  Do we want to live in the kind of world where the state has that level of control over the body?  If not, then where do you draw the line? 

If we begin from the principle that bodily autonomy is the foundation of liberty, then assaults upon that liberty cannot be haphazardly implemented by administrative decree or even whim of the legislature.  More is required, and there must be limits on the extent to which any such intrusion can come to pass in the first instance.  

But we don't have that discussion, which is sad.  We should be having that discussion as a society.  Leaders should be keeping those principles in mind as they come up with policies, without regard to the exigencies of any current emergency.  That, by the way, seemed to be Gorsuch's point in his concurrence over the OSHA mandate --- if you were curious.

----- __75.8__ -----2022-02-08 13:03:50+08:00:

That isn't an off-ramp.  It's de-cluttering the data ecosystem, by distinguishing patient populations.  Astonishingly, folks in the alleged field of public health could not distinguish between someone who was hospitalized due to COVID infection and hospitalized under circumstances where any positive test was incidental to their reason for admission --- as the article indicates.  It literally took two years for this to be realized.  Stunning incompetence.

----- __75.9__ -----2022-02-08 13:07:43+08:00:

Sure, if he was capable of reaching that conclusion himself.  But he isn't.  He's relying on what others tell him.  It's not like he's running the analysis himself.  It's mildly hilarious to think about him trying, actually.  He wouldn't even know where to begin.

----- __75.10__ -----2022-02-08 13:37:35+08:00:

Maybe.  But the further into this I've investigated, the more it looks to me like it's a problem with the entire field of public health, generally, as opposed to incompetent individuals, particularly.  From what I can tell, this process is like selecting apples from a rotten barrel.  There are exceptions, like John Ionidis at Stanford.  Or Jay Bhattacharya, also at Stanford.  But instead, for some inexplicable reason the world decided to follow the crackpot nonsense of a guy whose h-index was about half of Ionidis's, who wouldn't even release his model's original source code and whose predictions have been off by orders of magnitude to the extent he's ran that same failed model on, everything from MERS, to the bird flu to the swine flu.  His model's assumptions were so unhinged from reality that it added essentially no value whatsoever to any discussion of anything.   Of course I am speaking of Neil Ferguson at Imperial and the team --- who included Americans --- that used a similar model with similarly vapid results.  Scientific fraud doesn't even approximate the level of egregiousness involved in all of this.  Not to get all "deep into the rabbit hole," but when I read his March 2020 paper I was reminded of a book John Perkins wrote titled "Confessions of an Economic Hitman."  There, Perkins details the use of bullshit modeling to justify provision of loans to the third world for infrastructure projects they will never pay back.  According to Perkins, the loans serve as a basis to exert control over those countries' internal politics and his models served as the basis for those loans.  Another example might be Enron's SEC filings about a year before it declared bankruptcy.  Or the mistakes that led to the challenger disaster.  All normalized pathologies.  That is how bad this was.  But the problem is that most people can't tell the difference between actual expertise and quackery --- so there was this reflexive "if you don't agree, then you're anti-science!" nonsense.  And that's how we got here.
