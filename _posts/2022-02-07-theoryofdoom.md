### 74: [Illinois school mask mandate ruling puts districts on spot to enforce or make optional](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/smdqvo/illinois_school_mask_mandate_ruling_puts/), submitted on 2022-02-07 09:37:04+08:00.

> If he doesn't appeal the decision, he admits the mandates were illegal and the campaign ads write themselves.

If he does appeal, he loses the suburbs and any prospect at re-election. Politically, he has no choice but to try to preempt the impact by standing down.  That mitigates the harm of his political loss.  Pritzker should have dropped the mask mandates a long time ago.

As an aside, the cohort of highly vocal people on reddit who use language like "anti-maskers" (as if someone who opposed masks was some kind of analogue of the stereotypical "anti-vaxxer") are hardly representative of where the general public is on this issue, in Illinois or nationally.

> I don’t know. Pritzker seems like he’s willing to die on this hill, despite most Democratic governors not reinstating mask mandates at the state level. He’ll double down as long as he thinks he’ll be re-elected or until Newsom and Hochul tell him that he’s being unreasonable.

I disagree with this.  Pritzker is neither particularly competent nor resolute.  He's going to respond to the politics, which have formed the basis of his so-called "COVID mitigation strategy."  And the politics favor change.  

He'll still lose re-election, however.  Even Churchill was thrown out after WWII.  He will be no different.  Any candidate as credible as Bruce Rauner or better will defeat him.

> It's that if this sets off a shockwave, and infections rise dramatically, it'd cause more undue strain on the healthcare system.

The lack of masks or mandated masking has had no effect whatsoever in the southern states and many others in the mountain-west region.  Nor has the presence of masks or mandated masking appreciably reduced community spread in enclosed buildings, in anywhere such "mitigations" have been enforced.  There are variables which influence community spread in enclosed buildings, like ventilation, but no one seems concerned about that anymore.

We'll see how long he keeps this charade up.

> Edit: NY is going to announce that their universal mask or vax mandate will end this week.

Source?  Not saying I don't believe you but I'd like to see something establishing as much.

Ok, well I've seen some conflicting information on that but it happens in a couple of days so we'll see.
