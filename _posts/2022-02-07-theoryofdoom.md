### 74: [Illinois school mask mandate ruling puts districts on spot to enforce or make optional](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/smdqvo/illinois_school_mask_mandate_ruling_puts/), submitted on 2022-02-07 09:37:04+08:00.

> If he doesn't appeal the decision, he admits the mandates were illegal and the campaign ads write themselves.

If he does appeal, he loses the suburbs and any prospect at re-election. Politically, he has no choice but to try to preempt the impact by standing down.  That mitigates the harm of his political loss.  Pritzker should have dropped the mask mandates a long time ago.

As an aside, the cohort of highly vocal people on reddit who use language like "anti-maskers" (as if someone who opposed masks was some kind of analogue of the stereotypical "anti-vaxxer") are hardly representative of where the general public is on this issue, in Illinois or nationally.

> I don’t know. Pritzker seems like he’s willing to die on this hill, despite most Democratic governors not reinstating mask mandates at the state level. He’ll double down as long as he thinks he’ll be re-elected or until Newsom and Hochul tell him that he’s being unreasonable.

I disagree with this.  Pritzker is neither particularly competent nor resolute.  He's going to respond to the politics, which have formed the basis of his so-called "COVID mitigation strategy."  And the politics favor change.  

He'll still lose re-election, however.  Even Churchill was thrown out after WWII.  He will be no different.  Any candidate as credible as Bruce Rauner or better will defeat him.

> It's that if this sets off a shockwave, and infections rise dramatically, it'd cause more undue strain on the healthcare system.

The lack of masks or mandated masking has had no effect whatsoever in the southern states and many others in the mountain-west region.  Nor has the presence of masks or mandated masking appreciably reduced community spread in enclosed buildings, in anywhere such "mitigations" have been enforced.  There are variables which influence community spread in enclosed buildings, like ventilation, but no one seems concerned about that anymore.

We'll see how long he keeps this charade up.

> I’m not so sure they can coalesce around a center-right, Trump-distanced candidate who can win over moderates in the collar counties.

Outside of Chicago, Springfield, Urbana-Champaign and (to some extent) Rockford, Illinois is pretty red.  I think they'll all prefer any Republican over Pritzker, even if the one they get is more like Mitt Romney than Josh Hawley.

### 75: [Gov. Pritzker Gives No Specific Metrics For Removing COVID-19 Mask Mandate, But Says It Will Depend On Hospitalizations](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/sn3xy7/gov_pritzker_gives_no_specific_metrics_for/), submitted on 2022-02-08 07:07:06+08:00.

Source?  Not saying I don't believe you but I'd like to see something establishing as much.

Ok, well I've seen some conflicting information on that but it happens in a couple of days so we'll see.

> I’m a diehard democrat and I am firmly anti mask mandate at this point. Most of my friends are the same way.

Same, for the most part.  Outside of the democrats I know in the 250k+ income bracket, the majority have been so repulsed by the way this pandemic has been handled they will never vote for another democrat again.  Most are afraid to admit it outside of the folks they know share those thoughts, but they're done.  They don't like Republicans and they don't want to see the GOP establishment, but almost without exception they think they miscalculated the lesser of two evils.  Even the most progressive types I've seen in Chicago have had enough.

----- __75.4__ -----2022-02-08 11:44:28+08:00:

I guess we'll see.  I don't know.

> there's no defending Pritzker's inability to provide any concrete roadmap for ending restrictions at this stage of the pandemic.

I don't know that there's "no" defending.  Practically, there is no medical or epidemiologic threshold that establishes when the pandemic is over.  So it has to be a political decision.  The bottom line is that he wants to be able to pull the plug when the politics make it expedient to do so, he can't if he commits himself to a specific threshold.  The bright side is that his free-floating and unbounded approach gives him political flexibility.  The dark side is that it's pretty transparently not based on anything objective and non-political. 

Not saying I'd do the same thing.  But it's not like I don't understand what he's up to.

> Pritzker is so guaranteed to win he can stick to his precious masks without any fear.

I don't think Pritzker has any ideological commitment to masks, mandates or any of the "mitigations" he's implemented.  Nor do I think he especially desires to maintain them.  But he doesn't want to pay the price of what will happen if he drops them and then, for whatever reason, cases/hospitalizations rise.  

It won't matter from a data-driven perspective whether the policy change caused or contributed in any way to any subsequent increase.  The by-line is going to be: "Pritzker drops mandate.  Hospitalizations skyrocket!"  That's what he's avoiding.  If hospitalizations skyrocket under circumstances where "mitigations" are in place, then he tells the public he did all he could.  But if they skyrocket after he drops them?  He'll be filleted like a cheap pollock.  

The concept of "hospitalizations or cases as measured by PCR and/or antigen tests" vary independently from policy measures intended to "contain" or "slow the spread" is just too much for the public to grasp.  This is going to be understood at the level of "Bush lied!  People died!"  That's what Pritzker is worried about --- which I guess he should be, given his "leadership style."

I obviously would have handled things differently.  But that's irrelevant, just like every other opinion I have on what he should have done lol.  I'm just some random guy on Reddit.
