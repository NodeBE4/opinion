### 434: [I told ChatGPT to write lyrics in the style of Joy Division and in my opinion it delivered eerily well.](https://old.reddit.com/r/JoyDivision/comments/zys84r/i_told_chatgpt_to_write_lyrics_in_the_style_of/), submitted on 2022-12-30 13:34:23+08:00.

Fuck.  That is surprisingly good.

### 435: [What do "decolonize" activists even want at this point?](https://old.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/1003n4s/what_do_decolonize_activists_even_want_at_this/), submitted on 2023-01-01 05:04:24+08:00.

----- __435.1__ -----2023-01-01 09:16:22+08:00:

"Decolonize" activists *want* to give meaning to *their* lives.  They aren't acting on behalf of anyone who is oppressed, but in a futile effort to distract themselves from the nihilistic abyss that is average existence in our postmodern world.

> The goals of these people are just to position their ethnic group as the favored political collaborators of (mostly White) finance capitalists in exploiting the majority of the population (aka "settlers").

You have just offended [every Palestinian on the internet](https://y.yarn.co/0303b209-3ac2-4564-a039-5ab1a300d6ea_text.gif).

----- __435.3__ -----2023-01-02 03:24:03+08:00:

[Sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABQnO6a2Tio&ab_channel=LuciferMagne).

----- __435.4__ -----2023-01-02 03:31:03+08:00:

I love how Palestinians (and those who believe themselves to be advocating on the Palestinians' behalf) think downvoting my comment advances their cause.

Also, I've been a one-state solution guy since the 1990s.

### 436: [Rejecting identities and labels --sign of an unhealthy ego or identification repressed to shadow ?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/100lzi1/rejecting_identities_and_labels_sign_of_an/), submitted on 2023-01-01 23:32:38+08:00.

----- __436.1__ -----2023-01-02 03:26:32+08:00:

Labels have nothing to do with the shadow, as Jung used that term.
