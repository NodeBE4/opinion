### 1149: [Why did the Boshin war end so quickly (just 1 year) ?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11w8esk/why_did_the_boshin_war_end_so_quickly_just_1_year/), submitted on 2023-03-20 12:25:05+08:00.

----- __1149.1__ -----2023-03-21 09:08:49+08:00:

I'd like to elaborate on the linked posts (thanks /u/huianxin) and on /u/ParallelPain's by pointing out that Yoshinobu's situation when he surrendered in May 1868 was considerably less than ideal.

Firstly, Toba-Fushimi. Bakufu casualties were actually quite high, because although 15000 or so men were assembled at Osaka, Yoshinobu had been – not incorrectly – paranoid about local lords declaring for SatChō, and had thus detached considerable forces to garrison key areas, and as a result the combined forces at Toba, Fushimi, and Yodo on 27 January were perhaps 6000 men at a stretch. The 900 or so men killed or wounded would have constituted around 15% of the force, which in a premodern context would be considered par for the course for a defeated army. The casualty rate was much lower than most major American Civil War battles of course – for instance, the Confederates lost a third of their troops at Gettysburg, the Union a quarter – but still, a lost battle is a demoralising affair that troops can have difficulty recovering from, particularly if they are vigorously pursued. Moreover, the detached forces simply don't seem to have been able to serve as a meaningful reserve in the wake of the collapse of the vanguard. So the army was defeated, split into two – one part going to Osaka and the other retreating to Edo – and there was very little ability to actually halt the continued SatChō advance. If the overall Bakufu war effort had been a little reluctant to begin with, then the defeat probably sapped much of whatever enthusiasm there had been.

We also ought to consider that Bakufu losses included not only killed and wounded on the battlefield, but critically, defections to the SatChō army among its central Japanese allies. The overall Bakufu expeditionary force at Osaka included at least 3700 men from its various allies. 1600 were from Aizu, but the remainder were predominantly from central Japan: 1000 from Tsu, 400 from Kuwana, and 1100 from Obama, Kameyama, and Himeji combined, along with uncertain numbers of others such as Matsuyama, Ōgaki, and Miyazu. But Tsu defected during the battle, Ōgaki and Miyazu shortly afterward, and Matsuyama withdrew from the war outright. Aizu and Kuwana were basically the only significant domains to contribute troops to the Bakufu force at Toba-Fushimi and still remain loyal afterward. Otherwise, the SatChō victory had essentially flipped the entirety of central Japan from broadly pro-Tokugawa to broadly pro-SatChō. The situation in northern Japan likewise did not favour the Tokugawa position. Only Aizu and to an extent Shōnai had supported the Bakufu at the start of the war, while the north had broadly declared neutrality. By April, many of the northern domains may have appeared to be aligned with the SatChō-controlled court, and on 3 May – about three weeks after Yoshinobu's surrender on 11 April – Sendai actually formally sided with the court to attack Aizu. So the Tokugawa clan was further hamstrung by its diplomatic isolation: the other lords of Japan simply were not, by and large, willing to commit themselves to the defence of their old hegemon.

It's worth restating ParallelPain's point here that a consistent priority for most of the belligerents seems to have been to ensure that the overall political and territorial integrity of Japan remained intact, because it is worth noting that Yoshinobu did have a nuclear option that would have theoretically allowed him to continue fighting while also denying any claim to be an enemy of the court. This was Prince Kōgen, the abbot of Kan'ei-ji in Ueno (styled Rinnōji-no-miya) and grandson by adoption of Emperor Kōkaku (Meiji's great-grandfather). It had been Tokugawa policy to ensure that the position of abbot of the Kan'ei-ji temple complex, just outside Edo, was held by a collateral prince of the imperial house, just in case it was deemed necessary to hoist their own rival emperor onto the throne. That Yoshinobu chose not to do this says a lot about his will and/or perceived ability to continue the fight. That the Northern Alliance, formed by Sendai after it fell out with SatChō within weeks of attacking Aizu, *did* install Kōgen as the Emperor Tōbu in August, says a lot about *their* investment in the fight.

Because, to pivot to that topic, we could honestly say it's surprising the Boshin War lasted as *long* as it did. The northern domains seem to have rapidly cottoned on to the fact that imperial restoration was actually just a cover for establishing a Satsuma and Chōshū hegemony, and, under Sendai leadership, banded together in an alliance over the course of late May and June. The calculus of attrition probably favoured SatChō anyway, but the vicissitudes of fortune played a part in shaping the conflict to come. Perhaps most critically, Akita Domain rather dramatically switched sides on 21 August and split the Northern Alliance's war effort onto two fronts, which limited Shōnai's ability to reinforce the much-pressed defence of Aizu. But there were also other factors: Tokugawa loyalists by and large cohered around Vice-Admiral Enomoto Takeaki and his rather romantic ambitions of establishing an autonomous fiefdom on Hokkaido, rather than supporting the northerners who had chosen not to support the Bakufu at the start of the year. On the flip side, you had the secondary front in Nagaoka Domain, where a SatChō force under Yamagata Aritomo tried to advance eastward along the coast and take the key northern port city of Niigata, which was deemed a key lynchpin in the supply of arms to Aizu. Despite an apparent superiority in numbers that allowed the SatChō force to quickly seize Nagaoka Castle, Yamagata completely bungled his next moves, spread his forces too wide, and ended up losing the castle again to an Alliance counterattack; Niigata ended up being taken *after* the fall of Aizu by an army advancing westward from the mountains. But either way, the forces of fortune didn't really decisively swing things either way, and the Northern Alliance collapsed under pressure from SatChō forces over the course of October and November. 

As ever, the winter was not good campaigning season, hence there being no real attempt to land at Hokkaido in force until the following spring. But in many ways, the war *could* have ended in April 1868. Indeed, we could probably surmise that, for Tokugawa Yoshinobu, it *should* have done. But the persistence of some Tokugawa loyalists like Enomoto Takeaki or the *shōgitai* guerrillas, plus the rather tactless behaviour of SatChō envoys to the northern domains, helped keep the war going for months past the resolution of the original crisis over the continued status of the Tokugawa clan and its holdings.

I'm not entirely sure that's the case, albeit going purely off what numbers I can glean from Totman, where adding together absolutely everything I can't see more than about 7000 men involved – and that's assuming relatively generous numbers for the uncountables. While the Bakufu theoretically had some 7000 regular troops (6000 in 12 regular battalions, plus the two battalions of Denshūtai/sappei), from what I can gather, only four to six of the battalions, plus the Denshūtai, were actually involved in the fighting.

EDIT: I probably ought to clarify that what I mean here are the numbers *at the battle itself*, rather than the total size of the expeditionary force.

----- __1149.3__ -----2023-03-21 15:18:10+08:00:

Thanks! This certainly complicates the numbers I'd got from Totman, and would suggest potentially a much larger force *overall* (as in, originally assembled at Ōsaka) than the 15k he suggested, assuming that what Noguchi means by a 'regiment' is equivalent to what Totman means by a 'battalion', and that the six regiments/battalions engaged represented only half of the twelve total in the army writ large.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 1152: [[meta] How would you feel if Wikipedia cited your answer from this sub?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11ykq9c/meta_how_would_you_feel_if_wikipedia_cited_your/), submitted on 2023-03-22 22:27:35+08:00.

----- __1152.1__ -----2023-03-24 04:35:31+08:00:

I think what you've suggested aligns mostly with what I think. Kevin's accounts weren't posting premium answers, so the only way to earn money was being partnered for revenue from questions, and from what I can tell, only a portion of the questions Kevin and his accounts responded to were posted by his sockpuppets. At least a few were from real users. Maybe this was a plausible deniability scheme, but either way, Kevin's approach was distinctly non-profit-maximising.

I think the interesting question is why he claimed all the various titles and accolades that he did on his main account: his PhD from the University of Austin being the big one. This is the sort of thing that is theoretically easy to check, but at the same time, if for whatever reason you don't want to believe someone is lying – because to be honest *why would anyone do this* – you wouldn't find it too difficult to work out some alternative rationale. In essence, Kevin was lying about his trustworthiness in order to build a self-sustaining circle of lies. Fascinatingly, he largely did this without producing a single sentence of original writing.

But part of me also wonders if it was some kind of curious social experiment. I don't know if you also caught the [sequel thread](https://twitter.com/EMicrostate/status/1491763068182745088), but if not I highly recommend you do: Kevin had maintained *at least* 20 sockpuppet accounts, and had already survived a partial purge of these a couple of years before I dug up the ring again. By having this ecosystem of sockpuppets, he was able to build up a sort of barrier of plausible deniability, where unless you were aware of the plagiarism, then it seemed utterly implausible that *all* 15-ish of the active accounts engaging with each other were fake. He also brazenly re-used an already-banned account (Josue Dennis Chance) with the same profile picture and bio, and I cannot imagine that was done for any reason other than to stick the finger up at Quora's nonexistent moderation. A lot of this feels like it was trying to see what he could get away with if nobody stopped him. Or it's a Tommy Tallarico situation where the lies build on each other endlessly.

But at the same time, Kevin was still taking care to ensure the ruse made sense. The sudden asking of follow-ups to old answers suggests that Kevin was, if nothing else, aware that a failure to answer follow-ups on Quora, especially genuinely new ones, would be seriously detrimental to his image. This meant, on occasion, doing the 'trickster plays against two chess grandmasters simultaneously' gambit as I describe in the linked thread, wherein Kevin copy-pasted follow-ups from Quora onto AskHistorians, and then crossposted the AH replies back over to Quora. Which is a real gamble in general because you're presuming that the original answerer will be willing to reply to the follow-up, but it's especially risky with older answers where the users might have left the sub, or be too engaged in other pursuits to substantively engage. As noted in that thread, there was a tendency for Kevin to randomly reply in threads asking about older answers on a *similar* topic by a given user, which is pretty unusual, especially if the user in question doesn't maintain an archive of links in their profile – which I do, to be fair.

But the weirdest part to me is that Kevin specifically reposted ELI5 comments as well as AskHistorians, and I'm genuinely curious what the rationale there was. Was he trying to diversify his content to avoid suspicion? This would be odd because a diverse range of expertises is *more* suspicious, not less. I really can't think of any good reason to do that, other than, perhaps, because he wanted to prove that he could.

So as it stands I think there are a few possibilities:

1. Kevin was desperate for attention and found what he thought was an easy way to get it;
2. Kevin was somewhat delusional and believed that this AskHistorians crossposting was doing Quora a service (which in a sense I suppose it was);
3. Kevin was mainly doing it to prove that he could, and that nobody would stop him.

I think the most unfortunate element of all this is that Quora's UI is not very friendly to archive searching, so now that Quora has actually taken action and purged things, we ordinary users performing Quora OSINT can't really go back and dig up more on Kevin Richardson. So this is all we have to go on.
