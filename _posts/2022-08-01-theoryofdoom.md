It starts in the early-mid 1980s, beginning when Richard transfers to Hampden College in Vermont in 1983.

Since we are limiting to a single novel, it's Donna Tartt's "The Secret History," followed closely by "The Goldfinch."

> The Catcher in the Rye being regarded as a coming-of-age novel

It's hard to get past how much of a petulant, whiny brat Holden is. A coming of age novel, where the main character does nothing of the sort.

----- __350.3__ -----2022-08-02 12:00:11+08:00:

That's kind of funny.  When I read Black Swan Green, I posted in an online community that it should replace Catcher in the Rye in schools.

I read Catcher in the Rye, the first time, when I was in 9th grade and I hated it then.  Years later in college, after an inebriated rant on how much I hated Holden, a significant other encouraged me to re-read it with fresh eyes.  

So I did.  And I hated Holden even more.

Totally agree.  And David Mitchell is an infinitely more talented author than J.D. Salinger.
