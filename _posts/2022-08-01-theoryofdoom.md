It starts in the early-mid 1980s, beginning when Richard transfers to Hampden College in Vermont in 1983.

Since we are limiting to a single novel, it's Donna Tartt's "The Secret History," followed closely by "The Goldfinch."

> The Catcher in the Rye being regarded as a coming-of-age novel

It's hard to get past how much of a petulant, whiny brat Holden is. A coming of age novel, where the main character does nothing of the sort.

----- __350.3__ -----2022-08-02 12:00:11+08:00:

That's kind of funny.  When I read Black Swan Green, I posted in an online community that it should replace Catcher in the Rye in schools.

----- __350.4__ -----2022-08-02 12:09:21+08:00:

I read Catcher in the Rye, the first time, when I was in 9th grade and I hated it then.  Years later in college, after an inebriated rant on how much I hated Holden, a significant other encouraged me to re-read it with fresh eyes.  

So I did.  And I hated Holden even more.

Totally agree.  And David Mitchell is an infinitely more talented author than J.D. Salinger.

### 351: [What is your favorite nonfiction book or essay collection mainly because of their mastery of the language and the quality of its prose (its eloquence, rhythms, vocabulary choice)?](https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wi0cj7/what_is_your_favorite_nonfiction_book_or_essay/), submitted on 2022-08-07 06:42:35+08:00.

> DFW is the obvious answer.

It is actually surprising to me that I had to scroll down this far to find what I came here to post.  I almost wonder if the current generation knows who he was and why he mattered.

The way DFW used the english language approximates perfection.
