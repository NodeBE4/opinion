RT‚ÄÇSheena Greitens<br>Terribly sad to hear of Ezra Vogel's passing. He was a remarkable scholar, & his wisdom, energy, humor, & kindness made him a role model for so many. His impact on the field, on US-China relations, & on all who knew him is hard to measure. He will be missed. üôèüèª<br><br>Richard J. Samuels:‚ÄÇ@DanielPAldrich @MansfieldFDN @sfujihira @AbeFellowship @devintstewart Sadly, the reports are accurate. He passed away from complications after surgery.

There is nothing at all wrong with well-supported, well-documented and cogent lack of surprise.<br><br>Alex Dukalskis:‚ÄÇIt bugs me when reviewers criticize something in a paper for being ‚Äúunsurprising‚Äù.
