RT Sheena Greitens<br>Terribly sad to hear of Ezra Vogel's passing. He was a remarkable scholar, & his wisdom, energy, humor, & kindness made him a role model for so many. His impact on the field, on US-China relations, & on all who knew him is hard to measure. He will be missed. 🙏🏻<br><br>Richard J. Samuels: @DanielPAldrich @MansfieldFDN @sfujihira @AbeFellowship @devintstewart Sadly, the reports are accurate. He passed away from complications after surgery.  A giant as scholar, public servant, and human being. Tirelessly curious.  Terrible loss.<br>

There is nothing at all wrong with well-supported, well-documented and cogent lack of surprise.<br><br>Alex Dukalskis: It bugs me when reviewers criticize something in a paper for being “unsurprising”. Counterintuitive findings are interesting when they happen but not every paper or book need be counterintuitive. This isn’t a magic show or a circus: it’s not the author’s job to “surprise” people.<br>
