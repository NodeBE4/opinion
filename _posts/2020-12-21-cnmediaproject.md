RT Sheena Greitens<br>Terribly sad to hear of Ezra Vogel's passing. He was a remarkable scholar, & his wisdom, energy, humor, & kindness made him a role model for so many. His impact on the field, on US-China relations, & on all who knew him is hard to measure. He will be missed. 🙏🏻<br><br>Richard J. Samuels: @DanielPAldrich @MansfieldFDN @sfujihira @AbeFellowship @devintstewart Sadly, the reports are accurate. He passed away from complications after surgery.  A giant as scholar, public servant, and human being. Tirelessly curious.  Terrible loss.<br>

RT Reinhard Bütikofer<br>Vis-à-vis #Vietnam EU in its FTA deal insisted, successfully, that the country would ratify pertinent core conventions of the ILO.

This is an on-the-money thread about moves within the CCP discourse and what is at stake.<br><br>Carl Minzner: (1/x) Starting to suspect that the rectification campaign that will sweep through China's political-legal bureaucracy in 2021 might be a major vector for trying to raise Xi Jinping's ideological place in the CCP political pantheon yet closer to Mao Zedong.<br>

There is nothing at all wrong with well-supported, well-documented and cogent lack of surprise.<br><br>Alex Dukalskis: It bugs me when reviewers criticize something in a paper for being “unsurprising”. Counterintuitive findings are interesting when they happen but not every paper or book need be counterintuitive. This isn’t a magic show or a circus: it’s not the author’s job to “surprise” people.<br>
