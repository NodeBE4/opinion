### 892: [Does anyone have recommendations for good books on China over the last 200-300 years?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yc47fy/does_anyone_have_recommendations_for_good_books/), submitted on 2022-10-24 14:42:18+08:00.

The two relatively standard recommendations are the late Jonathan Spence's *The Search for Modern China* (3rd edition 2012) and Pamela Kyle Crossley's *The Wobbling Pivot – China Since 1800: an Interpretive History* (1st ed. 2010). Each has its upsides and downsides.

Spence's book is decidedly more narrative, although a certain running theme is its reckoning with the idea of 'modernity' and what it means in a Chinese context. His coverage begins in the late Ming and goes up to the then-present, so covers a period about twice as long as Crossley, but the book is also proportionately longer to match. Spence was one of the best prose writers among Anglophone historians, and indeed one of few academic historians of China whose work was read widely outside academic circles, and in that regard the book is incredibly readable. Spence wrote the first edition right on the cusp of the 'New Qing' turn that significantly reframed much of what we understand about the Qing empire, and as a result even in the later editions there may be the odd interpretive quibble coming from the more Manchucentric wings of the Qing history profession, but it is broadly speaking still quite solid and relevant historiographically.

Crossley's book is distinctly more theoretical and interpretive, and its intended audience is somewhat more scholarly if not necessarily narrowly academic. Her writing style can occasionally be a bit obtuse when she gets into highly theoretical or analytical topics, but this is much less pronounced in *The Wobbling Pivot* than some of her other writings (*A Translucent Mirror* is the most egregious example cited). Crossley also makes the odd albeit often inconsequential factual error, especially when covering post-Qing subjects, while her coverage of Cixi's political ascendancy takes a relatively strong view of Cixi as being functionally irrelevant, in contrast to most historians who afford her at least some degree of influence in one or more spheres of power (see for instance Edward Rhoads' *Manchus and Han*). It's a somewhat mixed bag, but serves as a pretty good primer on the period covered, with a focus on bringing approaches and lenses of analysis from the Qing period forward into the 20th and 21st centuries, and suggesting that fundamental continuities persisted past the more superficially apparent disruptions of the Republican and Communist revolutions.
