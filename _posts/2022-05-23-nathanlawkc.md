As I said in commencement speech:<br>"Inviting a Hong Kong activist to campus is not easy and certainly not without cost, let alone awarding me an honorary doctorate degree. So I want to acknowledge, once again, the entire @wjcollege community for your hospitality and friendship."<br><br>John C. Knapp: It was was a privilege to confer an honorary doctorate on @nathanlawkc at today’s @wjcollege commencement. His speech inspired our Class of 2022: “Only by accepting the possibility of failures, breathing in the bravery to adventure . . . can we create our own paths.”<br><br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1528072344756838400/pu/vid/1280x720/b9iQ4XzIJNx5VCq5.mp4?tag=12" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1528072344756838400/pu/img/2leNYPQnjevL5jzY.jpg"></video>

"My life will be full if I realize the dream of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong. But my life is not empty without it, and I am always proud of the hurdles I have overcome ... The result does not define you as a person; the process does."<br>@WJcollege<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1529513605212807170/vid/1280x720/5ygwm3KZTNoTERus.mp4?tag=14" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1529513605212807170/img/HLHV6xHMyc9BxkmG.jpg"></video>

We arranged and went into the meeting as Hongkongers, but we are also citizens of the world.<br>“In the face of the recent tragedy,” I told Leader McConnell at the end, “we should all do something to protect our children.”<br><br>Hong Kong Democracy Council: Our team met with @LeaderMcConnell yesterday regarding #HongKong. We conveyed the urgency of creating humanitarian pathways for Hong Kongers in the United States. @McConnellPress<br><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTyFQHAWQAEY0yr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
