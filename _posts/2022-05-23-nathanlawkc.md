As I said in commencement speech:<br>"Inviting a Hong Kong activist to campus is not easy and certainly not without cost, let alone awarding me an honorary doctorate degree. So I want to acknowledge, once again, the entire @wjcollege community for your hospitality and friendship."<br><br>John C. Knapp: It was was a privilege to confer an honorary doctorate on @nathanlawkc at today’s @wjcollege commencement. His speech inspired our Class of 2022: “Only by accepting the possibility of failures, breathing in the bravery to adventure . . . can we create our own paths.”<br><br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1528072344756838400/pu/vid/1280x720/b9iQ4XzIJNx5VCq5.mp4?tag=12" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1528072344756838400/pu/img/2leNYPQnjevL5jzY.jpg"></video>
