[The 2020 Stratechery Year in Review](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-2020-stratechery-year-in-review/)
------

<div>
<p>From the beginning of Stratechery I have posited that writing about tech is a way to write about everything, given the way in which the Internet is affecting every part of society. The pandemic of 2020 has put this thesis on steroids: the lasting impact of COVID will be not entirely new ways of living, but rather the dramatic acceleration of trends that were already in place, particularly those enabled by technology. This includes real world issues like working-from-home, and new digital questions raised by the sheer quantity of information, much of it wrong, but some very right.</p><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/zero-trust-information/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-2020-03-11-23.15.55-2-1024x815.png" alt="A drawing of The Implication of More Information" width="640" height="509" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4730" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-2020-03-11-23.15.55-2-1024x815.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-2020-03-11-23.15.55-2-300x239.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-2020-03-11-23.15.55-2-768x611.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-2020-03-11-23.15.55-2-791x630.png 791w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-2020-03-11-23.15.55-2.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p><p>Stratechery explored all of these issues this year, in both 44 <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/articles/">Weekly Articles</a> and 141 <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/daily-email/">Daily Updates</a> (including 18 Daily Update Interviews).</p><p>This was also an exciting year for new product launches: in February Stratechery launched <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-daily-update-podcast/">The Stratechery Podcast</a> which lets you consume Stratechery in your favorite podcast player.

Notably, the first four articles were a sort of miniseries published in March; the final article discussed the same issues in the context of the election.</p><ul><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/zero-trust-information/">Zero Trust Information</a> — Zero Trust Networking is security with Internet assumptions; there is tremendous value if we apply the same approach to information.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/defining-information/">Defining Information</a> — In a follow-up to Zero Trust Information, exploring the four types of information and how their value changes with time.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/compaq-and-coronavirus/">Compaq and Coronavirus</a> — Compaq’s descent from a company of action to a brand is a frightening parable for the the West’s focus on talk over action.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/unmasking-twitter/">Unmasking Twitter</a> — Twitter has a new policy to listen to experts about what content to limit; what happens, though, when experts are wrong?</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/twitter-responsibility-and-accountability/">Twitter, Responsibility, and Accountability</a> — Twitter has a new policy to listen to experts about what content to limit; what happens, though, when experts are wrong?</li></ul><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/defining-information/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-Information-4-1024x767.png" alt="A drawing of Utility Versus Interest on Social Media" width="640" height="479" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4754" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-Information-4-1024x767.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-Information-4-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-Information-4-768x575.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-Information-4-841x630.png 841w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stratechery-Information-4.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p><h4>The Big Picture</h4><p>These are the articles where writing about tech means writing about the world broadly; this has never been more true than in 2020, particularly given that we are at <em>The End of the Beginning</em>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/">The End of the Beginning</a> — The beginning of technology was about the shift from batched computing in one place to continuous computing everywhere.

that inevitable moment arrived in a big way in 2020, with Congressional hearings, reports, and multiple antitrust lawsuits. Apple also received unprecedented attention for its control of the App Store; both were big topics on Stratechery:</p><ul><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/first-do-no-harm/">First, Do No Harm</a> — As regulators look closer at acquisitions they should be extremely wary of unintended consequences.
