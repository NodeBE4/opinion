Dictators work together to retain control. The collaboration of Russia and China has never been closer, despite the ongoing Ukraine war. They have pledged to reshape the global order and continue a 'no limits' relationship.<br>The risks democracies face are enormous.

He said it's Russia's national security interest to take "appropriate measures" regarding the Ukraine situation, and China provides support accordingly. <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/china-russia-ukraine-support-li-zhanshu-vyacheslav-volodin-1742731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.newsweek.com/china-russia-ukraine-support-li-zhanshu-vyacheslav-volodin-1742731</a>
