Re Another choice line: "Some media refer to the US as the world's only 'sanctions superpower.'" Correction, PD, an opinion piece in one US newspaper, the New York Times, made this reference.

Re PD editorials are an illuminating look at Chinese state media use of material from pluralistic press environments to support a monistic ideological perspective.
