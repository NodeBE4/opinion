Re @ericfish85 @YuanfenYang Indeed. It reminds one of the "Gold Ingot Case" exposed by Liu Chang at China Youth Daily back in the early 2000s, involving a mine disaster cover-up by local officials AND media including Xinhua. There is pressure in such cases to just make it a 内参.  Not go public.

Re The demand here is not just that platforms behave in terms of content regulation, but that they work “actively” to strengthen the presence of Party-state voices in the “self-media” space, ensuring that the Party’s views and agendas are mainstreamed.

Re Building the Party’s traditional influence over public opinion into the changing information landscape is a major priority, not least because the leadership has recognized mere restrictions on content, the cat-and-mouse game between censor and censored, is counter-productive.

Re As one scholar explained the dilemma four years ago: "When relevant departments block and restrict public opinion arbitrarily ... this lowers the effectiveness of news and opinion guidance, or even renders it ineffective, ultimately impacting the credibility of the government."

One of the perks of major political meetings like the annual <br>"two sessions" of the NPC and CPPCC . . . . Overwrought fonts, usually red and gold, glistening with the light of two suns. And so it is at People's Daily Online.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvtMlZ_XYAA64ZV?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
