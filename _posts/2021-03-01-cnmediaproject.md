Re @ericfish85 @YuanfenYang Indeed. It reminds one of the "Gold Ingot Case" exposed by Liu Chang at China Youth Daily back in the early 2000s, involving a mine disaster cover-up by local officials AND media including Xinhua. There is pressure in such cases to just make it a 内参.  Not go public.

Re The demand here is not just that platforms behave in terms of content regulation, but that they work “actively” to strengthen the presence of Party-state voices in the “self-media” space, ensuring that the Party’s views and agendas are mainstreamed.

Re Building the Party’s traditional influence over public opinion into the changing information landscape is a major priority, not least because the leadership has recognized mere restrictions on content, the cat-and-mouse game between censor and censored, is counter-productive.

Re As one scholar explained the dilemma four years ago: "When relevant departments block and restrict public opinion arbitrarily ... this lowers the effectiveness of news and opinion guidance, or even renders it ineffective, ultimately impacting the credibility of the government."

Re More variety surely at the provincial and municipal levels, right?  Wrong. Nanfang Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Guangdong CCP Committee, and Beijing Daily, the same of the BJ municipal CCP Committee.

Re The commercial spin-offs, or 子报 (lit. "child papers") have just a bit more leeway. And they do use it, sparingly. Here is Southern Metropolis Daily, under the Nanfang Daily Group.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvtQ3PhXcAM3boc?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re On the NFDB front-page you can see that the story about the opening of the session leads, with primary mention of Xi. But the biggest headline below the photo is for news that changes will be proposed to the Hong Kong electoral system.
