A must-read (and internalize) cautionary tale.<br><br>Zeyi Yang 杨泽毅: For the second @techreview China Report, I analyzed the spread of that ridiculous rumor about a coup in China. The fact that it grew so big and tricked so many, with the help of Indian Twitter and Falun Gong media accounts, is both funny and depressing.<br> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/27/1060131/twitter-misinformation-coup-china-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/27/1060131/twitter-misinformation-coup-china-india/</a>

There is a great deal of waste, inefficiency and even stupidity in how China conducts "external propaganda" — something probably too overlooked by scholars of "influence" (so broadly applied today). Important to highlight the ways state media are trying to get more strategic.<br><br>Devin Thorne: @cnmediaproject Cited your and @schoenmakersk’s article on personal brands (个人IP) too!<br>

Re To be clear, this "stupidity" is not about minds, but about the system, which drives initiatives through a top-down process of command without real attempts and efforts to understand global audiences. Under this system, the real audience becomes the commander.
