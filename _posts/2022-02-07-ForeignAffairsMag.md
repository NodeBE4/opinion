### 115: [How to Break the Cycle of Conflict With Russia: Seeking Consensus Isn’t Appeasement—It’s Pragmatism](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/smsc6r/how_to_break_the_cycle_of_conflict_with_russia/), submitted on 2022-02-07 23:05:19+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Samuel Charap, Senior Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation\]

"Until Russia, the United States, Europe, and the states stuck in between them reach a consensus on a revised regional order, post-Soviet Eurasia will remain a source of instability and conflict. Our proposal shows that such consensus might yet be possible."

### 116: [Burundi’s Vicious Crackdown Never Ended: America and the EU Just Chose to Ignore It](https://old.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/snkxtx/burundis_vicious_crackdown_never_ended_america/), submitted on 2022-02-08 22:00:41+08:00.

----- __116.1__ -----2022-02-08 22:02:06+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Mausi Segun, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa Division.\]

“Instead of hoping that the Burundian government will change its ways, the United States and the European Union should publicly push the country’s leaders to take concrete and measurable steps to improve their dire human rights record.”  
Burundian President Ndayishimiye took office pledging to deliver “peace and justice for all.” Instead, he has continued his predecessor’s brutal crackdown on dissent. But the West seems willing to ignore the new regime’s human rights violations, writes Mausi Segun.

----- __117.1__ -----2022-02-08 22:40:11+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Erica Chenoweth, Professor of the First Amendment at the Harvard Kennedy School, and Zoe Marks, Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School\]

“Although many autocrats and aspiring autocrats no doubt believe the sexist and misogynistic things they say, their campaigns to restrict women’s empowerment and human rights also seek to undermine potential democratic movements that would oust them.”

“Although many autocrats and aspiring autocrats no doubt believe the sexist and misogynistic things they say, their campaigns to restrict women’s empowerment and human rights also seek to undermine potential democratic movements that would oust them.”

In recent years, authoritarian leaders have launched a simultaneous assault on women’s rights and democracy that could roll back decades of progress on both fronts. Read why so many autocrats seem to fear women.
