Re 2/<br>From one extreme to another extreme doesn't work.<br>It shows the myth that authoritarian governments have better efficiency and work rate is inaccurate.<br>China analysts had been predicting when Beijing would end their strict control when most of the world restored normality.

Re 4/<br>With the messiness of the end of strict control, Chinese nationals are too afraid to go out, bodies are piled up outside mortuaries, hospitals are overcrowded, and pharmacies are running out of medicines used in COVID conditions.

Re 6/<br>After the recent Party Congress, when Xi centralized so much power, there was already analysis saying that the transformation of the CCP from a collective leadership to a single-strong-man leadership would lead to many problems.

Re 7/<br>The lack of flexibility in policy implementation when the lower tier officials have to follow every word of the top without questioning, haphazard ways of changing policies, and more unpredictable moves… all manifest in this episode of sudden change.

Re 9/<br>When the PRC spoke on the importance of retaining the COVID measures was describing how deadly the virus is, people's perception was not changing in a few days. Many still see COVID as more dangerous than it is, and rush to the hospital no matter how light the symptoms are.

Re 12/<br>The current crisis shows the weakness of a dictatorial regime, at the expense of people's lives. Stop glorifying the CCP regime &amp; its model because you don't understand how it works, or want to attack the "West" in general. Checks &amp; balances, and division of power matters.

Anyone who reports to PRC/HK authorities and puts the people speaking up against these regimes at risk should be arrested and prosecuted.<br>They are putting the people who criticize a dictatorial regime in danger -- including their families. It's evil. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63967785?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63967785?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email</a>

當政權要求你「愛國」，一切聽黨走時，你有想過國家愛你嗎？<br>中國的白紙示威過後，很多人都在想這個問題。於2019年初，我在一場公聽會中，曾經以香港人的身份回答過。<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1604213532634931200/vid/640x640/1CP-4DEyudLbnU1c.mp4?tag=16" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1604213532634931200/img/qBRIq1CmXKDQu6YL.jpg"></video>
