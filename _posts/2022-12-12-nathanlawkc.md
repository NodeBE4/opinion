Re 2/<br>From one extreme to another extreme doesn't work.<br>It shows the myth that authoritarian governments have better efficiency and work rate is inaccurate.<br>China analysts had been predicting when Beijing would end their strict control when most of the world restored normality.

Re 4/<br>With the messiness of the end of strict control, Chinese nationals are too afraid to go out, bodies are piled up outside mortuaries, hospitals are overcrowded, and pharmacies are running out of medicines used in COVID conditions.

Re 5/<br>This is nothing like how we expected a relaxation of COVID measures – people going out and spending more, the economy's engine restarting… If a gradual process of relaxing the measures had been in place, things would have been much better.

Re 8/<br>The change of narrative towards the pandemic is also shocking. We must understand the public discussion climate in China – when the Party has made a line on one thing, only supporting speeches are available.

Re 10/<br>And the stigmatization of "living with COVID" also bounces back to themselves. State media had been portraying this idea as a foreign state conspiracy to overthrow the Party and put them at risk. They now have a hard time convincing people that we're going to be ok.

Re 12/<br>The current crisis shows the weakness of a dictatorial regime, at the expense of people's lives. Stop glorifying the CCP regime &amp; its model because you don't understand how it works, or want to attack the "West" in general. Checks &amp; balances, and division of power matters.

Anyone who reports to PRC/HK authorities and puts the people speaking up against these regimes at risk should be arrested and prosecuted.<br>They are putting the people who criticize a dictatorial regime in danger -- including their families. It's evil. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63967785?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63967785?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email</a>

當政權要求你「愛國」，一切聽黨走時，你有想過國家愛你嗎？<br>中國的白紙示威過後，很多人都在想這個問題。於2019年初，我在一場公聽會中，曾經以香港人的身份回答過。<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1604213532634931200/vid/640x640/1CP-4DEyudLbnU1c.mp4?tag=16" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1604213532634931200/img/qBRIq1CmXKDQu6YL.jpg"></video>
