Submission Statement: 

The FSB is one of the KGB's successor agency.  According to purported intelligence sources inside the FSB, Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine was doomed to fail from its instantiation --- evidence of which abounds.  Russian casualties may exceed 10,000.  While only 498 fatalities in combat are acknowledged by the Russian defense ministry, the true number could be even higher than the 10,000-death estimate because contact has been lost with major Russian army divisions.  Even Ramzan Kadyrov's "hit squad" has been massacred by Ukrainians.  Kadyrov is a Chechen terrorist leader supported by Vladimir Putin's government.  

According to sources inside the FSB, Vladimir Putin's government's inept performance appears to be the result of his own delusions and Soviet-reminiscent tail-wagging-the-dog type mismanagement:

Suddenly it happens and everything comes down to your completely groundless analysis.  [We are] acting intuitively, on emotion . . . our stakes will have to be raised ever higher with the hope that suddenly something might come through for us.  By and large, though, Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat.

> an outright re-igniting of the Chechen wars.

This is unlikely, since Kadyrov owes his position to Putin.  But I have, frankly, been shocked to find Kadyrov's Chechen fighters have proven so inept.  Some believed them to be Eastern Europe's [Gurkhas](https://www.grunge.com/338917/why-gurkhas-are-considered-the-toughest-soldiers-in-the-world/).

### 156: [Going into year 3 of COVID-19 in Chicago, the new message is adaptability](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/t91c30/going_into_year_3_of_covid19_in_chicago_the_new/), submitted on 2022-03-08 06:26:35+08:00.

> The Democrats are the forever-maskers, though.  These two groups of people have gone hand-in-glove up until about three weeks ago. The Dems would/will go back to masks and restrictions again in an instant if they thought it was politically viable to do so. Keep that in mind this November, regardless of what the COVID situation may look like this spring, summer, or early fall.

Not exactly.  You're certainly correct that a cohort of democrats fall into the category of "forever maskers," but the overwhelming majority of actual democratic voters realize that masks and associated mandates were little more than theatrical.  Maybe they didn't see that at first, but their perspectives changed as time went on and forecasted COVID-related armageddon failed to materialize when other states dropped their mandates.  What changed about three weeks ago, as you note, wasn't what democrats believed or didn't believe, though.  What changed was what many were willing to acknowledge in public.  The pressure to conform to certain proclaimed norms in this pandemic resulted in many ignoring what was right in front of them; going along to get along, just to avoid meeting the fate of those who questioned whatever the current official line happened to be at any given point in time.  

At this time, only a much, much narrower cohort of still believes that mask-wearing makes a difference to community spread and/or their individual susceptibility to infection --- with or without regard to vaccination status.  That cohort's beliefs are unlikely to be changed by the presence or absence of any evidence, for several reasons.  First, that cohort only came to believe masks mattered due to media reports, based on speculation or outright misrepresentation.  Second, that cohort lacks the ability to independently recognize, much less understand, what constitutes evidence for or against their beliefs.  Third, that cohort's commitment to the idea of masks and mask efficacy has seemingly more to do with masks' subjective psychological effect than anything empirical.  So arguing with them is kind of like arguing against Gwyneth Paltrow, on the matter of whether her "healing crystals" work as advertised.  Keep in mind, however, that most of these people were trying --- yes, actually trying --- to do what they *really believed* to be "their part" to "stop the pandemic."  Because that's what they were told by "the Science" himself, Anthony Fauci.  Notice how conspicuously absent he's been in the media, lately?  But I digress. 

> We absolutely should not trust these people regarding the masks. They already brought them back once when there was no need to. Apart from politics, there is absolutely no reason to think they won't do it again. They do not get the benefit of the doubt about this.

I don't disagree, but there's something a lot bigger at stake here.  What is at stake isn't limited to re-imposition of mask or vaccine mandates, or other such nonsense.  Rather, what is at stake is the same as it was after 9/11 when establishment-type political whores massively expanded the scope of government power (e.g., forced the Patriot Act through congress, redefined the word "torture" to accommodate their so-called "war on terror" and the like) while vitiating Americans' most basic civil liberties (e.g., the right not to be subjected to persistent government surveillance, the right to habeas corpus and etc.).  

The issue presented by both mask mandates and other "public policy" measures that were based on either speculation or outright fraud in this pandemic relates to the nature of what kind of relationship we ought to have between the state and individuals.  

Here's the issue:  When and under what circumstances should unelected technocrats be allowed to set public public policy?  That's the issue we need to come to a consensus on, including in view of the technocrats' performance over the COVID-19 pandemic.  To begin to assess that question, a public inquiry into their decisions must follow at least at the federal level.  Should an "emergency" ever be used for the purpose of expanding government power, ever?  Neil Gorsuch's concurrence in the employer vaccine-mandate case explains why this matters.  If we allow the scope of the federal government's power to be expanded in the face of each new emergency, we incentivize persistent states of emergency in a slow-moving march to authoritarianism.  

The point is that civil liberty isn't negotiable.  Nor are fundamental, constitutionally guaranteed rights (e.g., freedom of speech, press and assembly) contingent upon the purported absence of any extant public emergency.

Your argument is that if you're not directly impacted by a public policy change, then you have no right to weigh in on it? 

Or were you just looking to move the goalpost?

### 160: [CMV: Age of consent in the USA should be federally mandated at 18 years old across all 50 states.](https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/tagkie/cmv_age_of_consent_in_the_usa_should_be_federally/), submitted on 2022-03-10 04:18:36+08:00.

> However, the federal government can be like "Do this thing or we withhold federal funding". 

The scope of federal regulatory authority is constitutionally limited, in such a way that absent specific constitutional authorization to do something the states retain that power.  Generally, the commerce clause is one of the broadest sources of congressional authority.  The Supreme Court struck down federal laws relating to violence against women, as falling outside the scope of what the commerce clause authorizes to be regulated.  The idea of regulating the age of consent seems like it would be outside the scope of at least the commerce clause, for similar reasons.  Whether there's another power Congress could find its authority in, I don't know.  But I doubt it.  That means that, most likely, even if congress said "raise the age of consent to 18 or we'll withhold highway funding," (compare to how we got drinking ages to 21, for example) it would probably fail judicial scrutiny.  The difference is that consumption of alcohol is an economic activity, whereas having sex isn't.

----- __160.2__ -----2022-03-10 21:11:06+08:00:

Prostitution is the oldest "profession" (read: an economic activity).  You may not be aware, but there's a difference between prostitution and having sex.  Unless you're one of those incels who can't get laid without paying for it, sex is not an economic activity.

Higher energy costs means that everything is more expensive, most importantly food which will invariably hurt human life and wellbeing far more than it will help reduce any environmental harm.  

So higher energy costs means that instead of a few hundred elderly people suffering heat exhaustion, many thousands more children will go hungry.  Not an acceptable tradeoff.
