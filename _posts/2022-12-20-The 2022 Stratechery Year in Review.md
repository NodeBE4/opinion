[The 2022 Stratechery Year in Review](https://stratechery.com/2022/the-2022-stratechery-year-in-review/)
------

<div>
<p>It was only a year ago that I opened the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/the-2021-stratechery-year-in-review/">2021 Year in Review</a> by noting that the news felt like a bit of a drag; the contrast to 2022 has been stark. The biggest story in tech not just this year but, I would argue, since the advent of mobile and cloud computing, was the emergence of AI. AI looms large not simply in terms of products, but also its connection to the semiconductor industry; that means the impact is not only a question of technology and society, but also geopolitics and, potentially, war. War, meanwhile, came to Europe, while inflation came to the world; tech valuations collapsed and the crypto bubble burst, and brought to light one of the largest frauds in history. All of this was discussed on Twitter, even as Twitter itself came to dominate the conversation, thanks to its purchase by Elon Musk.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/narratives-1.png?resize=640%2C320&#038;ssl=1" alt="&quot;Paperboy on a bike&quot; with Midjourney V3 and V4" width="640" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10011" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/narratives-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/narratives-1.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/narratives-1.png?resize=1024%2C511&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/narratives-1.png?resize=768%2C383&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/narratives-1.png?resize=1200%2C599&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p><p>Stratechery, meanwhile, entering its 10th year of publishing, underwent major changes of its own; a subscription to the Daily Update newsletter transformed into a subscription to the Stratechery Plus bundle, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>, my twice-weekly 15-minute show with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>’s John Gruber.</li><li><a href="https://sharptech.fm/">Sharp Tech</a>, my new twice-weekly hour-long show with Andrew Sharp.</li><li><a href="https://sharpchina.fm/">Sharp China</a>, a new weekly show with Andrew Sharp and <a href="https://sinocism.com/">Sinocism</a>’s Bill Bishop.</li></ul><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">Stratechery Interviews</a>, meanwhile, became its own distinct brand, befitting its weekly schedule and increased prominence in Stratechery’s offering.

This article used homework as a way to discuss how verifying and editing information will not only be essential in the future, but already are. I wrote two other articles about AI:<ul><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/">DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Content</a> — Machine-learning generated content has major implications on the Metaverse, because it brings the marginal cost of production to zero.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-ai-unbundling/">The AI Unbundling</a> — AI is starting to unbundle the final part of the idea propagation value chain: idea creation and substantiation.

An additional challenge for Shopify is the changing nature of Amazon’s moat:<ul><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/beyond-aggregation-amazon-as-a-service/">Beyond Aggregation: Amazon as a Service</a> — Amazon&#8217;s new Buy With Prime announced the arrival of Amazon Logistics as a Service, and is a big red flag for Shopify.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/">Digital Advertising in 2022</a> — The advertising has shifted from a Google-Facebook duopoly to one where Amazon and potentially Apple are major forces.

Discovery</a> — Warner Bros. Discovery is a company that makes a lot of sense, both because of its content and also its strategy, which treats streaming as an additional channel, not a reason-for-being. <em>See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/warner-bros-discovery-and-the-nba-the-zaslav-doctrine/">Warner Bros.
