I hope this movie can be brought to MAJOR streaming platforms and to as many audiences as possible.

Please #RT if you want to watch "Revolution of Our Times." We all know China will intimidate any platform that hosts the movie. We are here to counter it, to demonstrate #PEOPLE's #POWER and support a genuine artwork that deserves praise. <br>#StandWithHongKong @RoOT_film<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6qmfPvX0AA5GOM?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
