RT David Barboza<br>At his home, Orville Schell came upon an article he withdrew from The New Yorker about his search for forced labor camps in China in 1991. Now, more than 20 years later, he's publishing it. And it's quite a read! <a href="https://www.thewirechina.com/2022/01/30/changeless-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thewirechina.com/2022/01/30/changeless-china/</a>

RT Selina Wang<br>Inside v. outside the #WinterOlympics bubble. My colleague @David_Culver &amp; I haven't seen each other in ages. But the closest we could get was meters apart. Inside the closed loop, we're literally fenced in. <br>It's disconnected Beijing residents from the Games  @cnn @OutFrontCNN<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1488706564374552576/vid/1280x720/B2fpxtSP58HJmkVi.mp4?tag=14" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKj1V40XsAMRU_J?format=jpg&amp;name=orig"></video>

New in the CMP Dictionary: the "Three Closenesses" (三贴近). One of the earliest CCP phrases to encompass the notion of media developing and becoming more commercial, while at the same time maintaining political discipline. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/three-closenesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/three-closenesses/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKj9NO0akAESlCa?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

The CCP's obsession with #-based phrases can be exacting. But this year China's politics will center on just 2 crucial catchphrases: the “2 Establishes” and the “2 Safeguards" -- and 1 simple message: Xi will lead China beyond 2022. <a href="https://bit.ly/35IWcPj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/35IWcPj</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKl74R4aIAgmNm0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Jeff Wasserstrom<br>Reading: an ARC of Indelible City by ⁦@limlouisa⁩. It’s even better than I expected &amp; that’s saying a LOT. I’ve long admire her work but this daring, bracingly personal, carefully crafted &amp; researched chronicle of a beloved city’s still a revelation. <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/646684/indelible-city-by-louisa-lim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/646684/indelible-city-by-louisa-lim/</a>

RT Devin Thorne<br>Re I tried to use a tight methodology here, which means a lot more work can be done on this topic. Stella Chen’s recent report @cnmediaproject on China’s video game industry is a great example of diving deeper: <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/25/gaming-for-the-china-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/25/gaming-for-the-china-story/</a>

Beijing has railed against the “politicization of sports" by critics ahead of the Winter Olympics. But the government's own language shows that it views these Games as a political opportunity to tell the official "China story" at the cost of other voices. <a href="https://bit.ly/35PgIOg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/35PgIOg</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKvASijaUAAjFp0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
