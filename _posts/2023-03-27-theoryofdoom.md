I have never heard of "mandatory" tutoring, as an additional instructional component, nor have I ever seen a college math professor give participation points for such a component (particularly, where doing so would change the course requirements mid-way through the semester).  If that grading criteria was added after the course began, it likely does not comply with intradepartmental (or university) policy.  However, if that criteria was a part of the original syllabus, OP needs to have a discussion with the professor.

If OP is doing well without the tutoring, it is insane to penalize him/her by requiring mere participation in a separate instructional component.  

> This next bit is going to sound harsh, but I'm speaking from the viewpoint of the professor and department. 

I am also speaking from the viewpoint of a professor.  And my response to you will seem a bit harsh, because you seem to have missed the point of what a math class is supposed to do.  

Further, from the viewpoint of a professor who routinely butted heads with incompetent departmental and university admins, in my experience, the folks on the admin side tend to be the ones who are too incompetent to conduct a proper class.  Almost without exception, they lack anything approximating instructional ability, and more or less function as the "HR" of universities.  The folks who fill these roles rarely publish.  Doing so is often beyond the limits of their ability.  If they publish, they can only pass muster in journals no one has ever heard of.  Their h-indexes are lower than some of the post docs I've worked with. And they have not even submitted a grant proposal in years, or if they have, they never got funded.  Is this your situation?  

> While I may not agree with the professor's policy, my issue is that it seems pretty late in the semester to address this policy. If all expectations were given to you upfront and you stayed in the course without asking your professor for potential accommodations, etc., the you implicitly agreed to the policy. Then, you failed to comply, and now you're complaining because you didn't do the work. I'm not saying that is what happened. But that's what it's going to look like.

I am getting the sense that you do not actually teach.  Let's unpack this situation together.

First, OP is in an "online only" math class.  Which is terrible.  The post-COVID incoming classes seem to be further behind than any prior, because everyone dropped the ball during the pandemic.  I remember when this bullshit began.  Pearson and McGraw Hill started aggressively marketing their "online components" as course supplements to a standardized curriculum for lower-level classes.  University department heads, who did not understand (and did not bother to understand) how those classes were taught thought this would be a great idea.  But they incorrectly assumed those platforms would work as advertised.  They never did. 

Second, you assume OP knew the tutoring was mandatory, or should have known the tutoring was mandatory, as of the date the class began.  Did you read the OP?  OP has a 4.0 GPA outside of **this** class, in particular.  Students with 4.0 GPAs tend to be able to perform, whether they have a good professor or not.  But you assumed the professor communicated the course grading criteria clearly from the start.  It seems to me like if the grading criteria *were* communicated clearly from the start (read: written in the initial syllabus), OP wouldn't be in this situation.

Third, although OP wasn't clear on this point, it seems to me like the professor changed the grading criteria mid-way through the semester.  A component that was not there before has now been added.  If the professor changed the grading criteria in the middle of the semester, that's an issue.  It may also be an issue from a departmental perspective.  As someone who holds himself out to be "speaking from the viewpoint of the . . . department," I am surprised you didn't note this issue.  All you said was that the student shouldn't go to the chair without talking to the professor first.  And your only suggestion was to have the student try to make up the tutoring, which you assumed was a part of the grading criteria from day one of the class.  

Fourth, if the professor changed the grading criteria mid-way through the semester, it seems like that's something we would need to understand.  If a lot of students are failing to perform adequately, granting "participation" points may be a way to boost their grades.  Credit for participation in a math class seems fairly idiotic to me, but I assume you never taught math classes (or anything similar).  However idiotic the new grading scheme may be for this sort of class, there's got to be a way to do it without tanking OP's grade while still being fair to the rest of the class.  Further note that making tutoring "mandatory" could impact the credit-hour designation with the registrar, so it is not obvious to me the professor even had the right to add an additional instructional component such as mandatory tutoring.  

Fifth, I suggest you take a step back and think about what the point of a math class is, in the first place.  The point is to equip students with a skillset that is useful in the world, outside of school.  The point is not to account for time spent doing a particular activity, such as ostensibly "mandatory" tutoring.  If OP was performing well without the bullshit participation component, based on the prior objective grading criteria (e.g., tests, quizzes, homework, etc.), it is nonsensical to add such a component that would drop his/her grade.  Your "advice" seems to have missed that most basic aspect.

> Regardless, I don't think OP intentionally tried to ignore work.

Students with 4.0 GPAs tend to aim to meet expectations, no matter how stupid those expectations are.  

Mandatory tutoring for a college math class is a stupid expectation.  It is not normal at all. 

But it seems reasonable to infer that if that expectation was a part of the course requirements that the professor clearly communicated from the start (read: written out in the syllabus), OP wouldn't be in this situation.

That is why the comment from "Charming-Barnacle-15" seems pretty vapid to me.

----- __515.3__ -----2023-03-29 21:48:59+08:00:

Yes, it is. And the whole approach of "assume the student fucked up," when OP says he/she has a 4.0 GPA otherwise is insane.  

OP seems to have been blindsided by expectations that were changed mid-way through the semester.  Which is understandable.

----- __515.4__ -----2023-03-30 11:29:13+08:00:

If tutoring is mandatory where you teach, you are in no position to weigh in on pedagogy.  That would be like asking Nikocado Avocado for dietary advice. 

Your further misapprehensions do not require my response.
