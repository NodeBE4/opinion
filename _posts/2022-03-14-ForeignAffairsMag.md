### 153: [The Return of Pax Americana?: Putin’s War Is Fortifying the Democratic Alliance](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tdxfij/the_return_of_pax_americana_putins_war_is/), submitted on 2022-03-14 21:24:11+08:00.

"Putin’s aggression has created a window of strategic opportunity for Washington and its allies. The democracies must now undertake a major multilateral rearmament program and erect firmer defenses—military and otherwise—against the coming wave of autocratic aggression. They must exploit the current crisis to weaken the autocrats’ capacity for coercion and subversion and deepen the economic and diplomatic cooperation among liberal states around the globe. The invasion of Ukraine signals a new phase in an intensifying struggle to shape the international order. The democratic world won’t have a better chance to position itself for success."

\[SS from the article by Ana Raquel Minian, Associate Professor of History at Stanford University\]

"Biden’s immigration policies are more similar to Trump’s than many Americans are willing to recognize, and in turn, those policies do not represent a departure from the United States’ longstanding approach to immigration. Those who denounced Trump’s practices should subject the current administration to the same scrutiny and criticism or risk another three years of stalled dialogue and empty promises to fix a broken system."
