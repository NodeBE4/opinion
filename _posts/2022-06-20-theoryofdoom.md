> I'll avoid those subs, since it's clear only certain types of people are welcome there. 

I work in biotech.  Every day on Reddit, I see folks with the audacity to pretend their religious adherence to what they think is "science" amounts to something like moral virtue.  All that cohort of poorly educated liberal arts majors does is jerk each other off, repeating words they do not understand from yesterday's headlines.  

They're the first to silence anyone who disagrees, despite the fact that even simple concepts are lost on them.  Like math.  Maybe that's why they were liberal arts majors.

Posts like this are why ContextModBot should not exist.

It's hilarious, dude.  Show them an actual journal article discussing the shit they think they understand, they report it as "misinformation."

### 308: [What’s an opinion you have that’s considered unacceptable by societal standards?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vgiy1z/whats_an_opinion_you_have_thats_considered/), submitted on 2022-06-20 19:07:52+08:00.

No evidence even suggests it would have been meaningfully worse.

----- __308.2__ -----2022-06-20 20:18:36+08:00:

A casual review of [the evidence](https://brownstone.org/articles/more-than-400-studies-on-the-failure-of-compulsory-covid-interventions/) indicates otherwise.

So called "fact checks" are not evidence.
