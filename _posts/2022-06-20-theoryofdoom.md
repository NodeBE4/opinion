> I'll avoid those subs, since it's clear only certain types of people are welcome there. 

I work in biotech.  Every day on Reddit, I see folks with the audacity to pretend their religious adherence to what they think is "science" amounts to something like moral virtue.  All that cohort of poorly educated liberal arts majors does is jerk each other off, repeating words they do not understand from yesterday's headlines.  

They're the first to silence anyone who disagrees, despite the fact that even simple concepts are lost on them.  Like math.  Maybe that's why they were liberal arts majors.

Posts like this are why ContextModBot should not exist.

It's hilarious, dude.  Show them an actual journal article discussing the shit they think they understand, they report it as "misinformation."

### 308: [What’s an opinion you have that’s considered unacceptable by societal standards?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vgiy1z/whats_an_opinion_you_have_thats_considered/), submitted on 2022-06-20 19:07:52+08:00.

----- __308.1__ -----2022-06-20 19:58:53+08:00:

No evidence even suggests it would have been meaningfully worse.

----- __308.2__ -----2022-06-20 20:18:36+08:00:

A casual review of [the evidence](https://brownstone.org/articles/more-than-400-studies-on-the-failure-of-compulsory-covid-interventions/) indicates otherwise.

So called "fact checks" are not evidence.

This is interesting, but not proper for /r/geopolitics.

### 312: [Started working out again after a 2 years relationship, this is the results after 4,5 months](https://old.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/vhb1sr/started_working_out_again_after_a_2_years/), submitted on 2022-06-21 19:23:43+08:00.

Keep it up!  Great progress so far!

### 313: [Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/vivkxf/defending_ukraine_early_lessons_from_the_cyber_war/), submitted on 2022-06-23 20:17:50+08:00.

Submission Statement:

Brad Smith (Microsoft President & Vice Chair) discusses Microsoft's [newly issued report](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE50KOK) accounting for the role of technology in Russia's current war in Ukraine, particularly the Russian military's strategy for cyber attacks, network penetration and espionage.  Further, this report considers how stakeholders can coordinate to better counter these threats in Ukraine and other future potential conflict theaters.  

For many familiar with that conflict these conclusions will be unsurprising, but this report's analysis reaches five main points:

* Countries must be able to disperse and distribute digital operations and data assets across borders, for their defense against military invasion to be effective.
* Cyber-attacks are a reality of current military conflict, meaning that cyber threat intelligence and end-point protections must be regarded as a critical part of operations.  
* The threat posed by network penetration (including to infrastructure) and espionage is not limited to domestic infrastructure, but includes every stakeholder with whom intelligence is shared.  
* Allied strategy must account for the coordinated, global cyber-based influence operations used to support military operations and advance objectives of foreign state actors.  
* Allied countries must coordinate infrastructure hardening and defense strengthening against the full range of destructive, espionage and influence operations.

### 314: [A Post-Roe World?: Why Abortion Battles in America Won’t Halt Reform Abroad](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/vjqyc4/a_postroe_world_why_abortion_battles_in_america/), submitted on 2022-06-24 23:24:24+08:00.

----- __314.1__ -----2022-06-25 14:27:58+08:00:

This is beyond the scope of our focus at /r/geopolitics.  Further, it is unclear how this article passed u/foreignaffairsmag internal editorial standards.

----- __314.2__ -----2022-06-26 07:46:35+08:00:

I reiterate a message I have communicated to your board in the past, speaking now solely as a Foreign Affairs subscriber of almost two decades:

The decline in editorial standards at Foreign Affairs is something I and numerous others have noticed, are aware of and now once more bring to your leadership's attention.  Articles like this are the same species of reactionary, short-sighted professional misjudgment and strategic mismanagement that Jeff Zucker undertook at CNN. 

Foreign Affairs is not Buzzfeed.  Your board --- and specifically its current leadership --- would do well to remember that.  This article, like all such others of its type, is beneath the standards of FA.  It should not have been published and should not have even made it past initial editorial review.  

You may contact me if you have any questions.

### 315: [US Marine Force Reconnaissance during a simulated beachhead infiltration, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, 1985](https://old.reddit.com/r/coldwar/comments/vkadsk/us_marine_force_reconnaissance_during_a_simulated/), submitted on 2022-06-25 16:21:16+08:00.

----- __315.1__ -----2022-06-26 04:09:18+08:00:

You need to link [sources](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_Force_Reconnaissance) for things.  The website appears to have taken this image from Wikipedia, which itself appears to have taken it from a mid 1990s training exercise described in DOD materials released about a decade later on the USMC's website.  

This is a post-cold war image, with post-cold war tech.  It's interesting, don't get me wrong.  But this stuff didn't show up until after the USSR was no more.

----- __315.2__ -----2022-06-26 04:16:37+08:00:

The image was taken after 1995.

### 316: [Is Russia’s depletion of military equipment going to impact any other regions where they are exporting weapons to? Could it sway any other conflicts?](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/vkdr3c/is_russias_depletion_of_military_equipment_going/), submitted on 2022-06-25 20:12:21+08:00.

----- __316.1__ -----2022-06-27 00:03:13+08:00:

This is better submitted to /r/geopolitics2.
