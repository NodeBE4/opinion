### 307: [What’s an opinion you have that’s considered unacceptable by societal standards?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vgiy1z/whats_an_opinion_you_have_thats_considered/), submitted on 2022-06-20 19:07:52+08:00.

No evidence even suggests it would have been meaningfully worse.

A casual review of [the evidence](https://brownstone.org/articles/more-than-400-studies-on-the-failure-of-compulsory-covid-interventions/) indicates otherwise.

So called "fact checks" are not evidence.
