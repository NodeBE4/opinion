### 62: [Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-02-01. 8665 New Cases.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/si1b2l/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220201_8665_new/), submitted on 2022-02-02 02:05:05+08:00.

Removed.  You have significantly misunderstood what you linked.

> Cool, tell me exactly what I misunderstood?

My willingness to spend time trying to correct the deficits in your understanding of the subject matters raised in your comment, among other things.  This is the bottom line: you made a whole bunch of claims that do not now and have never had any basis in science whatsoever.  Then you linked a bunch of random articles you clearly failed to read/understand, while holding them out as constituting "peer reviewed science" in support of your "opinions," while making absurd claims about how stupid everyone else is (e.g., "I provide peer reviewed science for my opinions, while none these mask haters have none.").  If you had even tried to find evidence to support what you wrote, I might try because I like to see people engaging with the science of this stuff.  But you're not even serious about it.

Realize further that if you do this again, you will be temp-banned for an appropriate length of time.  This is the first and only warning you'll get.  Others may be more willing to put up with this nonsense.  I am not.

The sole issue is whether this can be a platform for users to deliberately or recklessly misrepresent facts under circumstances where others may be harmed by such actions.  Further, it turns out that repeating a bunch of unsupported declarative statements does not constitute "evidence" in support of anything.  It's just rehash of the same nonsense, which is a waste of everyone's time.  

The personal or political opinions of others --- whether or not grounded in facts and/or science of any kind --- just do not concern me.  Accusations of bias, attacks and censorship from users who repeatedly and deliberately violate our rules don't concern me either.  It amazes me how invested people think moderators are in users' personal views, presumably because if banned users were in a position to silence others who disagree with them they would do so.  

Everybody can have their own opinions.  But as you were previously warned, this subreddit will not become a platform for pandemic-related misinformation.

Let's not descend into schoolyard-bully type jokes.

> I don’t know - if he can’t see his feet, can he see his shadow?

Same goes for you.  Let's not descend into schoolyard-bully type jokes.  

Within the universe of subject matters on which Pritzker may deserve criticism, let's keep it focused to matters relevant to this subreddit in this setting.
