### 62: [Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-02-01. 8665 New Cases.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/si1b2l/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220201_8665_new/), submitted on 2022-02-02 02:05:05+08:00.

Removed.  You have significantly misunderstood what you linked.

> Cool, tell me exactly what I misunderstood?

My willingness to spend time trying to correct the deficits in your understanding of the subject matters raised in your comment, among other things.  This is the bottom line: you made a whole bunch of claims that do not now and have never had any basis in science whatsoever.  Then you linked a bunch of random articles you clearly failed to read/understand, while holding them out as constituting "peer reviewed science" in support of your "opinions," while making absurd claims about how stupid everyone else is (e.g., "I provide peer reviewed science for my opinions, while none these mask haters have none.").  If you had even tried to find evidence to support what you wrote, I might try because I like to see people engaging with the science of this stuff.  But you're not even serious about it.

Realize further that if you do this again, you will be temp-banned for an appropriate length of time.  This is the first and only warning you'll get.  Others may be more willing to put up with this nonsense.  I am not.

The sole issue is whether this can be a platform for users to deliberately or recklessly misrepresent facts under circumstances where others may be harmed by such actions.  Further, it turns out that repeating a bunch of unsupported declarative statements does not constitute "evidence" in support of anything.  It's just rehash of the same nonsense, which is a waste of everyone's time.  

The personal or political opinions of others --- whether or not grounded in facts and/or science of any kind --- just do not concern me.  Accusations of bias, attacks and censorship from users who repeatedly and deliberately violate our rules don't concern me either.  It amazes me how invested people think moderators are in users' personal views, presumably because if banned users were in a position to silence others who disagree with them they would do so.  

Everybody can have their own opinions.  But as you were previously warned, this subreddit will not become a platform for pandemic-related misinformation.

Let's not descend into schoolyard-bully type jokes.

> I don’t know - if he can’t see his feet, can he see his shadow?

Same goes for you.  Let's not descend into schoolyard-bully type jokes.  

Within the universe of subject matters on which Pritzker may deserve criticism, let's keep it focused to matters relevant to this subreddit in this setting.

Yep.  At least now there isn't even any pretense that they give a shit about working class people or middle America in general.  They care about this idiocy.

> Nobody has EVER argued that we shouldn't ever talk about removing restrictions EVER. 

I understand you're not literally claiming that, literally, "nobody has EVER argued that we shouldn't ever talk about removing restrictions EVER," because to do so would be absurd.  Those discussions have taken place across the country and the world at large.  For example, as you may not be aware, Oregon's [health officials are moving forward with a proposal to make the state's indoor mask mandate permanent](https://www.newsweek.com/oregon-officials-propose-making-indoor-mask-mandate-permanent-1670702).  What you're actually doing, or trying to do, is reply with a counter-generalization to what /u/jbchi said based on what you think the tone is.  There are better and worse ways to do that, but demonstrably false declarative statements isn't optimal.

> The reason that more people are looking the future (including me) is that is where the tide is turning, even among leading public health officials, otherwise, there wouldn't be the high level discussions that are currently happening, and should happen. 

That's a weird statement to make, because there was never any singular tide to turn among anyone in the field of medicine or public health.  There was a politically charged, media-driven effort to make it seem like there might have been based on some fringe pseudoscience out of Imperial College.  

What there was, rather than any singular tide to turn, was a chaotic series of undercurrents raging beneath a surface that simply appeared to move in the direction of the winds above.  People were afraid to speak because if they did, they were afraid they'd get the same treatment that Stanford Professor John Ionidis did, for example, when so called "Twitter Fact Checkers" delineated truth from falsehood based whatever CNN said the NIH or CDC said.  

The problem is that unless you were following these discussions in real time --- in places like actual letters to the editor, various preprints and the occasional op-ed that would show up in the Wall Street Journal or the Telegraph --- you just would not see the degree of contention these "measures" created in the field.  

> you assume those who are looking to the phase after the pandemic are doing so for reasons of it being some sort of "farce" or that the "dominoes are falling" on some sort of false narrative

What type of evidence would be necessary for something related to COVID to be revealed as some sort of "farce" --- as you say?  And just exactly which "dominoes" are you even talking about?

> She isn't actively antagonizing her entire constituency on every single issue like Lori somehow manages.

That's because Kamila isn't in California anymore.  Ironically, her political career was built doing --- with impunity --- tremendous harm to black communities in her role in law enforcement.  But then she got woke when it became politically convenient to do so, just like Biden.  Even though Biden called the 94 crime bill the "Biden crime bill" and Kamila engaged in every conceivable species of prosecutorial misconduct to lock up black kids and destroy black families so as to make a name for herself as being "tough on crime" when that's what the people of California wanted.

It's incredible how the meaning of words has deteriorated over the course of the pandemic.  And not just in relation to things the government is up to.  But for everything.

I don't see how this is relevant.
