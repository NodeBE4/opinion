There's quite a bit actually. There's an edited volume, *The Construction of Racial Identities in China and Japan*, with one chapter each on anti-Semitism and discourses around Jewishness in those countries. Well worth a read.

### 1060: [How would I refer to Alexander?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10erl6x/how_would_i_refer_to_alexander/), submitted on 2023-01-18 07:45:01+08:00.

In addition to the answer already linked, I'd also like to draw your eyes to [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l7ehi3/relationship_between_alexander_the_great_and_his/glicfea/) (or better yet the linked article), which discusses a revisionist position on *proskynesis* (formal prostration) arguing that a lot of what has been said about it has been exaggerated.

### 1061: [I am Peter Samsonov, author of IS-2: Development, Design, and Production of Stalin's Warhammer. AMA about Soviet heavy tanks!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10f9hm3/i_am_peter_samsonov_author_of_is2_development/), submitted on 2023-01-18 23:03:17+08:00.

----- __1061.1__ -----2023-01-18 23:07:43+08:00:

So, I have got to ask this, although I admit, it isn't about the IS-2, at least not directly.

The KV-2. The terrifying, top-heavy-looking monstrosity that is the KV-2. Whose idea was it, why did nobody at any point say 'let's not', and was it any good? Or, if you prefer a more IS-2-based question, what sorts of design lessons did the KV-2 provide? What worked well, what needed correcting?

----- __1061.2__ -----2023-01-19 01:01:53+08:00:

Thanks! There does seem to have been an experimental quality about the KV-2 from appearances alone and I'm unsurprised it didn't go anywhere.

Every once in a while I am reminded that yes, Yogscast does still exist and didn't just sort of fizzle out in 2015. Believe it or not, The Spiffing Brit is *technically* a Yogscast affiliate channel despite not advertising it.

### 1063: [Thursday Reading & Recommendations | January 19, 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10g2eld/thursday_reading_recommendations_january_19_2023/), submitted on 2023-01-19 22:00:09+08:00.

For a general survey, William T. Rowe's *China's Last Empire: The Great Qing* is a very good synthesis of the scholarship on the pre-1800 period, albeit with a general geographic bias towards the Yangtze valley and China proper more broadly, over the full scope of the Qing empire. 

Peter Perdue's *China Marches West* is the book to read on the expansion of Qing rule into Inner Eurasia, although it mainly covers the conquest more than governance. For that, see James Millward's *Beyond the Pass* on Xinjiang, Max Oidtmann's *Forging The Golden Urn* on Tibet, and/or Johan Elverskog's *Our Great Qing* on Mongolia. Matthew Mosca's *From Frontier Policy to Foreign Policy* also gets into the matter of Qing understandings of India, which may also be of interest. Looking at a different domain of expansion, Ronald Po's *The Blue Frontier* is a good revisionist history of Qing maritime policy.

For a dive into the politics of China Proper, books on controversies seem to be the big ones for getting a glimpse into the inner workings of the state, so have a look at *Treason by the Book* by Jonathan Spence, which narrates the 1727 Zeng Jing affair, and especially at Philip Kuhn's *Soulstealers*, which uses the 1767 queue-cutting panic as a window into the structures of Qing governance. While a little older, James Polachek's *The Inner Opium War* is a fascinating little deep-dive into Qing high politics from the end of the Qianlong reign to the early Xianfeng reign. A more focussed study looking specifically at the Jiaqing reign is Wensheng Wang's *White Lotus Rebels and South China Pirates*, which attempts to contextualise his reforms in terms of rational responses to real deficiencies, rather than as a sign of 'dynastic decline' as Kuhn had framed it. R. Kent Guy's *Qing Governors and Their Provinces* is one I have but have not read, but it covers both a wide span of space and time and may be a good single-book choice.

It's worth also considering the Qing's more colonial frontiers: Emma Teng's *Taiwan's Imagined Geography*, John Robert Shepard's *Statecraft and Political Economy on the Taiwan Frontier, 1600-1800*, and Laura Hostetler's *Qing Colonial Enterprise* are all extremely valuable reads on Qing relations with indigenous peoples. The second and third chapters of Norman Smith's edited volume *Empire and Environment in the Making of Manchuria* are also worth reading for an understanding of the colonial dynamics of Qing rule in that region, and see also Jonathan Schlesinger's *A World Trimmed With Fur* on the broader interaction between ecology, economy, and colonialism on the Qing periphery.

It would be remiss not to include some key cornerstones of 'New Qing' historiography as well. The two big ones would be Pamela Crossley's *A Translucent Mirror*, about Qianlong-era ideological developments, and Mark Elliott's *The Manchu Way*, about the development of the Banner system up to about 1800. There's also a couple of edited volumes worth looking at: Lynn Struve's *The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time* and Millward, Dunnell, Elliott and Forêt's *New Qing Imperial History*.
