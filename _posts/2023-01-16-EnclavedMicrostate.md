### 1058: [Mindless Monday, 16 January 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/10dcsdy/mindless_monday_16_january_2023/), submitted on 2023-01-16 20:00:11+08:00.

There's quite a bit actually. There's an edited volume, *The Construction of Racial Identities in China and Japan*, with one chapter each on anti-Semitism and discourses around Jewishness in those countries. Well worth a read.

### 1059: [Why were the upper class of Chinese society scholars rather than warrior aristocrats?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10e0zp7/why_were_the_upper_class_of_chinese_society/), submitted on 2023-01-17 11:02:05+08:00.

### 1060: [How would I refer to Alexander?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10erl6x/how_would_i_refer_to_alexander/), submitted on 2023-01-18 07:45:01+08:00.

In addition to the answer already linked, I'd also like to draw your eyes to [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l7ehi3/relationship_between_alexander_the_great_and_his/glicfea/) (or better yet the linked article), which discusses a revisionist position on *proskynesis* (formal prostration) arguing that a lot of what has been said about it has been exaggerated.

### 1061: [I am Peter Samsonov, author of IS-2: Development, Design, and Production of Stalin's Warhammer. AMA about Soviet heavy tanks!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10f9hm3/i_am_peter_samsonov_author_of_is2_development/), submitted on 2023-01-18 23:03:17+08:00.

----- __1061.1__ -----2023-01-18 23:07:43+08:00:

So, I have got to ask this, although I admit, it isn't about the IS-2, at least not directly.

The KV-2. The terrifying, top-heavy-looking monstrosity that is the KV-2. Whose idea was it, why did nobody at any point say 'let's not', and was it any good? Or, if you prefer a more IS-2-based question, what sorts of design lessons did the KV-2 provide? What worked well, what needed correcting?

----- __1061.2__ -----2023-01-19 01:01:53+08:00:

Thanks! There does seem to have been an experimental quality about the KV-2 from appearances alone and I'm unsurprised it didn't go anywhere.
