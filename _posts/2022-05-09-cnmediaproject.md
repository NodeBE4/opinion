Re @jordanschnyc CMP has happily labored in the CCP discourse space for 15 years, through frequent "quantitative" eye-rolling. Great to see that a range of researchers are coming around -- and recognizing the links with the past as well.

Last week Luo Changping was given a 7-month jail sentence for defaming the country’s martyrs and heroes. The harsh penalty for a journalist once hailed in China for his heroic anti-corruption work reveals how deeply values have shifted under Xi Jinping. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/10/honoring-chinas-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/10/honoring-chinas-heroes/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FSW9YlrakAAJK-0?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
