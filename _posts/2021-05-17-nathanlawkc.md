Hi Rep.@IlhanMN, thanks for concerning the rise of Asian hate crime. I think we should not conflate the concepts of regime and people: we need a tough policy on CCP and education on treating everyone equally.<br>Please don't forget CCP commits genocide behaviors to Muslim minority.<br><br>Ilhan Omar: We need to distinguish between justified criticisms of the Chinese government’s human rights record & a Cold War mentality that uses China as a scapegoat for our own domestic problems and demonizes Chinese Americans.<br><br>Racism has no place in policy debates.<br> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/19/china-policies-racism-489688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/19/china-policies-racism-489688</a>

The European Parliament has made a rational decision -- freezing the EU-China investment pack. Human rights violations in China should be addressed and tackled before any of the ratification processes start.<br><br>Stuart Lau: EU should focus “less on emotional outbursts and more on rational thinking,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said, in response to MEPs’ freezing the investment pact. “It should make the right decision in its own interest.”<br>

Re 2. The CCP colluders are trying to silence the critics in YOUR country. It raises concerns over infiltration from the CCP into the US academics, and the societies in general. I am pleased that the school upholds the values of free speech and academic integrity.

Re 3. The event went smoothly. Yet, the attack shows how CCP aggression threatens our cherished values. The other schools may not stand as firmly as Uchicago did. I hope the govt can look into signs of infiltration in these CSSA and to ACT to protect the FREEDOMS in YOUR country.

These bullying actions from CSSA do not represent the liberal-minded Chinese students. Yet, the reputation of them is tarnished by these abuses. I call for thorough investigations on CSSA’s infiltration as the extended arm of CCP. Our free speech should be protected.<br><br>Nathan Law 羅冠聰: 1. Last week I was invited to attend a guest series at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. By then, I did not realize that the UC Chinese Students and Scholars Association(CSSA) protested the invitation and accuse me of “hurting” their feelings with all the disinformation.<br><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2A3uyNXEAMw8Cm?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
