### 794: [How did the idea of the 'Nine Worthies' (Hector, Alexander, Caesar; Joshua, David, Judas Maccabeus; Arthur, Charlemagne, Godfrey of Bouillon) as exemplars of chivalric virtue come to be canonised? How widespread was recognition? Did different places have different versions of the nine?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xc200s/how_did_the_idea_of_the_nine_worthies_hector/), submitted on 2022-09-12 11:23:45+08:00.
