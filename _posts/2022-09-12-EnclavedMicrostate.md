### 794: [How did the idea of the 'Nine Worthies' (Hector, Alexander, Caesar; Joshua, David, Judas Maccabeus; Arthur, Charlemagne, Godfrey of Bouillon) as exemplars of chivalric virtue come to be canonised? How widespread was recognition?

Thanks!

### 795: [One of the narratives I got about (the British experience on the Western Front of) the First World War at school was that the rum ration given to soldiers was a critical part of the war effort, as one would have to be somewhat tipsy to even contemplate going 'over the top'. How much of this is true?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xc7gc8/one_of_the_narratives_i_got_about_the_british/), submitted on 2022-09-12 16:39:11+08:00.

Thanks! Seems like it was indeed more of an ad-hoc process than had been presented.

### 796: [What are the specific ways that Taiping Christianity differed from more mainstream versions of Christianity?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xdd47g/what_are_the_specific_ways_that_taiping/), submitted on 2022-09-14 01:08:56+08:00.

Not to evade the question too much, but the matter of what 'mainstream versions of Christianity' would constitute in a nineteenth-century context is not necessarily a simple one to tackle. Even if we just go by what is colloquially called 'mainstream Christianity', i.e. Nicene, which encompasses overarching categories of Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant, we run into a lot of heterogeneity within these categories (take for instance Lutheranism vs Calvinism) as well as differences across them. Transubstantiation is perhaps the most easily discussed (and something that happens to cover both belief and practice at the same time), with the Catholic and Orthodox traditions holding that the wine and bread literally become the blood and flesh of Christ when imbibed, while Protestant denominations hold the Eucharist as purely symbolic (except for the Anglo-Catholic communion although that's a weird middle ground of doctrinal Catholicism but outside communion with Rome). And that's not even getting into established offshoots like the Society of Friends (Quakers) – what do we consider 'mainstream' and what do we not? What we *could* do to attempt a more grounded approach is look at missionary accounts and mine them for instances where differences in beliefs are highlighted, but this will generally skew towards the viewpoints of individual evangelists with specific areas of focus in any given document.

I would also add that the usefulness of this question is perhaps debatable, at least in terms of its inherent wider implications. If you asked this question in reference to [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wt8z0a/the_blending_of_the_greek_and_roman_pantheons_is/il5zmnb/) (and if you hadn't you ought to give it a read) then you'll probably have absorbed my point that Taiping beliefs and practices were more complicated than simply deviation or adherence to a sort of idealised standard Christianity, and that attempts to catalogue such deviations and similarities have rarely resulted in useful scholarship, as opposed to more intersectional approaches. You will be able to find all sorts of little details on which the Taiping deviated from, say, belief and practice in Anglicanism, but that would not change the Taiping's own convictions in its commonalities and compatibility of their own.

To use an illustrative example, Taiping Christology was a form of unitarianism in which God and Jesus were separate individuals and in which God alone was actually divine, with Jesus being an intermediate being of higher spiritual status as God's directly-sired son, but not exactly an object of worship. This, incidentally, was also where Hong Xiuquan fit in. On paper, this absolutely conflicts with Nicene Christianity (the root from which Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and in turn Protestantism derive), in which God and Jesus are consubstantial – what we might consider as distinct aspects of the same being. Indeed, we could if we wanted to point out all the areas where the Taiping's Christology differed from that codified in the Nicene Creed, or the later Athanasian Creed that affirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine. But doing so would obscure the fact that the Taiping *mostly* did align with them. While they did not see Jesus as consubstantial with God, they did believe that he existed before the creation of the world, and they did believe in the Resurrection.

Once you get out of these core doctrinal discussions and enter the world of praxis, then we get into extremely diverse territory. The Taiping did not recognise saints, but that puts them no more at odds with Orthodoxy and Catholicism than several 'low-church' Protestant denominations (indeed, most Protestant traditions besides Anglicanism). Church services were performed quite differently, and the Taiping only observed some rites that most denominations consider standard. The Eucharist in particular (just to bring things full circle) was not performed, and indeed of the Seven Sacraments of Catholicism, only two – Baptism and Matrimony – existed in roughly similar form among the Taiping. Yet the Taiping did have healing rites, which although very different in form to the Catholic sacraments, still involved, at a core level, an appeal to divine grace either to heal a sick member of the community or to assure a dead member's ascent to Heaven.

In some ways perhaps the approach I've hinted at above is the most useful way of looking at Taiping Christianity – not in terms of specific deviations, but more in terms of how Taiping beliefs and practices approximated or fulfilled equivalent functions to those of 'mainline' Christianity, but in a manner shaped by existing patterns of religious thought. What is, in my opinion, the most illustrative form of this is as regards Taiping demonology. The Taiping, not unlike many Christians of the day, believed that malevolent spirits existed and had an effect on the real world, but do not appear to have had the same conception of demons as being immutable and immortal fallen angels. Indeed, the precise origin of demons in Taiping belief are somewhat vague and obscure, but the belief that demons a) existed, b) had come to be worshipped as the gods of Buddhism and Chinese folk religion, and c) therefore had to be destroyed in order that China would be liberated, arguably served as the *raison d'être* of the Heavenly Kingdom. Taiping soteriology was thus very much framed as being in relation to the practice of demon-worship by the deluded and ignorant, rather than notions of either collective or individual sin in the abstract. But there was still a soteriology, and there was a congruence in the belief that demons affected the real world.

Now, I could enumerate every single difference and we would be here all year, and there are those who have written more detailed works on Taiping religion that are worth consulting – Carl Kilcourse's *Taiping Theology* (2017) and Thomas Reilly's *The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom* (2004) being the main ones. If you have more specific questions I would be happy to try to tackle them, but as it is there's only so much I can think to write about on the very broad topic of how the *entire* belief system of the Taiping measured up against the *entire* belief system of Chalcedonian Christianity.

### 797: [What is a “proto-fascist” and is the term worth anything to historians?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xe1oze/what_is_a_protofascist_and_is_the_term_worth/), submitted on 2022-09-14 21:13:46+08:00.

Apologies if this ends up being a slightly tangential question, but how does modern fascism studies see the relationship between fascism and earlier New Imperialism?

I ask as I had recently come across and read George Orwell's two essays on Rudyard Kipling, the latter of which, from 1942, includes a few statements on how Kipling's conservative imperialism differed from fascism:

> ...the first clue to any understanding of Kipling, morally or politically, is the fact that he was not a Fascist. He was further from being one than the most humane or the most ‘progressive’ person is able to be nowadays.

> Kipling’s outlook is pre-fascist. He still believes that pride comes before a fall and that the gods punish hubris. He does not foresee the tank, the bombing plane, the radio and the secret police, or their psychological results.

> But in saying this, does not one unsay what I said above about Kipling’s jingoism and brutality? No, one is merely saying that the nineteenth-century imperialist outlook and the modern gangster outlook are two different things... All his confidence, his bouncing vulgar vitality, sprang out of limitations which no Fascist or near-Fascist shares.

> Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition.

Obviously Orwell's writing reflects a very specific and individual perspective, but to what extent is it argued today that fascism represented a fundamental rupture from 19th century patterns of thought, even militant imperialism?

A lot for me to chew on and think over. Thanks!
