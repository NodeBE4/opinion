### 795: [How did the idea of the 'Nine Worthies' (Hector, Alexander, Caesar; Joshua, David, Judas Maccabeus; Arthur, Charlemagne, Godfrey of Bouillon) as exemplars of chivalric virtue come to be canonised? How widespread was recognition?

Thanks!

### 796: [One of the narratives I got about (the British experience on the Western Front of) the First World War at school was that the rum ration given to soldiers was a critical part of the war effort, as one would have to be somewhat tipsy to even contemplate going 'over the top'. How much of this is true?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xc7gc8/one_of_the_narratives_i_got_about_the_british/), submitted on 2022-09-12 16:39:11+08:00.

Thanks! Seems like it was indeed more of an ad-hoc process than had been presented.

### 797: [What are the specific ways that Taiping Christianity differed from more mainstream versions of Christianity?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xdd47g/what_are_the_specific_ways_that_taiping/), submitted on 2022-09-14 01:08:56+08:00.

----- __797.1__ -----2022-09-14 16:34:49+08:00:

Not to evade the question too much, but the matter of what 'mainstream versions of Christianity' would constitute in a nineteenth-century context is not necessarily a simple one to tackle. Even if we just go by what is colloquially called 'mainstream Christianity', i.e. Nicene, which encompasses overarching categories of Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant, we run into a lot of heterogeneity within these categories (take for instance Lutheranism vs Calvinism) as well as differences across them. Transubstantiation is perhaps the most easily discussed (and something that happens to cover both belief and practice at the same time), with the Catholic and Orthodox traditions holding that the wine and bread literally become the blood and flesh of Christ when imbibed, while Protestant denominations hold the Eucharist as purely symbolic (except for the Anglo-Catholic communion although that's a weird middle ground of doctrinal Catholicism but outside communion with Rome). And that's not even getting into established offshoots like the Society of Friends (Quakers) – what do we consider 'mainstream' and what do we not? What we *could* do to attempt a more grounded approach is look at missionary accounts and mine them for instances where differences in beliefs are highlighted, but this will generally skew towards the viewpoints of individual evangelists with specific areas of focus in any given document.

I would also add that the usefulness of this question is perhaps debatable, at least in terms of its inherent wider implications. If you asked this question in reference to [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wt8z0a/the_blending_of_the_greek_and_roman_pantheons_is/il5zmnb/) (and if you hadn't you ought to give it a read) then you'll probably have absorbed my point that Taiping beliefs and practices were more complicated than simply deviation or adherence to a sort of idealised standard Christianity, and that attempts to catalogue such deviations and similarities have rarely resulted in useful scholarship, as opposed to more intersectional approaches. You will be able to find all sorts of little details on which the Taiping deviated from, say, belief and practice in Anglicanism, but that would not change the Taiping's own convictions in its commonalities and compatibility of their own.

To use an illustrative example, Taiping Christology was a form of unitarianism in which God and Jesus were separate individuals and in which God alone was actually divine, with Jesus being an intermediate being of higher spiritual status as God's directly-sired son, but not exactly an object of worship. This, incidentally, was also where Hong Xiuquan fit in. On paper, this absolutely conflicts with Nicene Christianity (the root from which Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and in turn Protestantism derive), in which God and Jesus are consubstantial – what we might consider as distinct aspects of the same being. Indeed, we could if we wanted to point out all the areas where the Taiping's Christology differed from that codified in the Nicene Creed, or the later Athanasian Creed that affirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine. But doing so would obscure the fact that the Taiping *mostly* did align with them. While they did not see Jesus as consubstantial with God, they did believe that he existed before the creation of the world, and they did believe in the Resurrection.

Once you get out of these core doctrinal discussions and enter the world of praxis, then we get into extremely diverse territory. The Taiping did not recognise saints, but that puts them no more at odds with Orthodoxy and Catholicism than several 'low-church' Protestant denominations (indeed, most Protestant traditions besides Anglicanism). Church services were performed quite differently, and the Taiping only observed some rites that most denominations consider standard. The Eucharist in particular (just to bring things full circle) was not performed, and indeed of the Seven Sacraments of Catholicism, only two – Baptism and Matrimony – existed in roughly similar form among the Taiping. Yet the Taiping did have healing rites, which although very different in form to the Catholic sacraments, still involved, at a core level, an appeal to divine grace either to heal a sick member of the community or to assure a dead member's ascent to Heaven.

In some ways perhaps the approach I've hinted at above is the most useful way of looking at Taiping Christianity – not in terms of specific deviations, but more in terms of how Taiping beliefs and practices approximated or fulfilled equivalent functions to those of 'mainline' Christianity, but in a manner shaped by existing patterns of religious thought. What is, in my opinion, the most illustrative form of this is as regards Taiping demonology. The Taiping, not unlike many Christians of the day, believed that malevolent spirits existed and had an effect on the real world, but do not appear to have had the same conception of demons as being immutable and immortal fallen angels. Indeed, the precise origin of demons in Taiping belief are somewhat vague and obscure, but the belief that demons a) existed, b) had come to be worshipped as the gods of Buddhism and Chinese folk religion, and c) therefore had to be destroyed in order that China would be liberated, arguably served as the *raison d'être* of the Heavenly Kingdom. Taiping soteriology was thus very much framed as being in relation to the practice of demon-worship by the deluded and ignorant, rather than notions of either collective or individual sin in the abstract. But there was still a soteriology, and there was a congruence in the belief that demons affected the real world.

Now, I could enumerate every single difference and we would be here all year, and there are those who have written more detailed works on Taiping religion that are worth consulting – Carl Kilcourse's *Taiping Theology* (2017) and Thomas Reilly's *The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom* (2004) being the main ones. If you have more specific questions I would be happy to try to tackle them, but as it is there's only so much I can think to write about on the very broad topic of how the *entire* belief system of the Taiping measured up against the *entire* belief system of Chalcedonian Christianity.

### 798: [What is a “proto-fascist” and is the term worth anything to historians?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xe1oze/what_is_a_protofascist_and_is_the_term_worth/), submitted on 2022-09-14 21:13:46+08:00.

----- __798.1__ -----2022-09-15 13:22:09+08:00:

Apologies if this ends up being a slightly tangential question, but how does modern fascism studies see the relationship between fascism and earlier New Imperialism?

I ask as I had recently come across and read George Orwell's two essays on Rudyard Kipling, the latter of which, from 1942, includes a few statements on how Kipling's conservative imperialism differed from fascism:

> ...the first clue to any understanding of Kipling, morally or politically, is the fact that he was not a Fascist. He was further from being one than the most humane or the most ‘progressive’ person is able to be nowadays.

> Kipling’s outlook is pre-fascist. He still believes that pride comes before a fall and that the gods punish hubris. He does not foresee the tank, the bombing plane, the radio and the secret police, or their psychological results.

> But in saying this, does not one unsay what I said above about Kipling’s jingoism and brutality? No, one is merely saying that the nineteenth-century imperialist outlook and the modern gangster outlook are two different things... All his confidence, his bouncing vulgar vitality, sprang out of limitations which no Fascist or near-Fascist shares.

> Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition.

Obviously Orwell's writing reflects a very specific and individual perspective, but to what extent is it argued today that fascism represented a fundamental rupture from 19th century patterns of thought, even militant imperialism?

A lot for me to chew on and think over. Thanks!

### 799: [On Google images there are photos supposedly of Hong Xiuquans son and his cousin Rengan, A.) are these real? And B.) are there photos of Hong himself?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xfh6sb/on_google_images_there_are_photos_supposedly_of/), submitted on 2022-09-16 12:13:27+08:00.

----- __799.1__ -----2022-09-16 14:17:39+08:00:

Until recently, the photos you cite of [Hong Tianguifu](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/totalwar-ar/images/5/57/245px-Hong_Tianguifu.png/revision/latest?cb=20190714104250) and [Hong Rengan](http://taipingrebellion.com/HongRengan.jpg) were up on the two people's Wikipedia pages, but I will confess to having always been somewhat sceptical, and I see that in the months or even years since I last visited those pages, the photos have been removed (which is for the better IMO). As you cite three figures, why not go through them in turn?

### Hong Tianguifu (The 'Young Monarch')

Hong Tianguifu was just under 15 when he was executed by the Qing, having nominally occupied the Heavenly Throne for a mere five and a half months – only one of which was spent in the Taiping capital before it fell to the Qing. It is not Hong Tianguifu in the photo linked earlier, and not only because his clothing does not at all resemble that of known Taiping dress styles. A quick search through on Wikimedia Commons shows that users discovered the actual provenance of the photo and that its claim to being of Hong Tianguifu is a hoax. It is in fact part of [a wedding photo](http://mbook.kongfz.com/3424/409394156/) auctioned in 2015, showing an arranged child marriage during the Republican era, half a century after Hong Tianguifu was executed.

### Hong Rengan (The Shield King)

The photograph allegedly of Hong Rengan during his time in Hong Kong has very little provenance attached. In English, it only appears on taipingrebellion.com, a very mixed bag as a reference site, although there are at least some Taiwanese and Chinese websites also allegedly depicting him. In reality though, this is not a photo of Hong Rengan at all, as can be seen from the more high-quality versions of the photo in which the subject can very clearly be seen sporting a thick grey moustache (Hong Rengan was in his 30s during his time in Hong Kong). A reverse image search suggests that the subject of the photo may actually be comprador and reformist Zheng Guanyin, at least according to [a page on the English-language website for his birthplace, Zhongshan City](http://www.zs.gov.cn/ywb/aboutzhongshan/celebrities/content/post_1637860.html). How the photo came to be associated with Hong Rengan is unclear.

### Hong Xiuquan (The Heavenly King)

Hong Xiuquan was notoriously reclusive after his coronation, and was never photographed during his lifetime. There are, however, two hand-made images that may be contemporary depictions of him. The [more well-known](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Hong_Xiuquan.jpg) is an engraving from Yvan and Callery's sensationalist 1853 work *L'Insurrection en Chine*, which actually does not purport to depict Hong himself but rather the imagined figure of 'Tièn-Tè', distinct from Hong Xiuquan who was identified as one of his subordinates. However, if it was indeed somehow drawn from life, or derived from an image that was, then it is not impossible that the original subject was indeed Hong Xiuquan. The other, which is quite obscure indeed, is [a portrait](https://web.archive.org/web/20191216095950/https://www.nicholasgrindley.com/06-0616.html) by the Shanghai painter Tingqua which used to be hosted on an art dealership website but which has since been taken offline (hence the archive.org link). How it came to be painted is unclear, and the colour of the clothing is not what would be expected for Hong Xiuquan, but it is at least more *likely* to be an authentic rendering. [Seemingly contemporary copies of the painting](https://bkimg.cdn.bcebos.com/pic/b64543a98226cffc71c9093bb7014a90f703ea5c?) circulate on parts of the Chinese internet, but again, attribution is tricky.

### Other members of the Hong family

Many members of the Hong clan actually escaped China in the aftermath of the Taiping War, and we actually have some photos of them. One of Hong Rengan's sons, Fung Khui-Syu, fled eventually to Guyana, and there are photos of him such as [this one](https://twitter.com/DevonDilly/status/1351205699829821443), and ones of his own sons, compiled [here](https://twitter.com/JennySiung/status/1441127154511646721). There is also an alleged photograph of [Hong Quanfu](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/%E6%B4%AA%E5%85%A8%E7%A6%8F.jpg?20150820105453), a member of the extended Hong clan although his exact relationship to Xiuquan is unknown; he fled to Southeast Asia before quietly cropping up in Hong Kong and getting roped into a plot to establish a second Heavenly Kingdom in Guangzhou in 1903 (which ended in disaster). So we do have *some* photographic record of the wider clan, but not of its most key members during the period of the original Heavenly Kingdom.

----- __799.2__ -----2022-09-16 23:40:32+08:00:

Unfortunately I'm not well-versed enough in Chinese diaspora dynamics to comment particularly effectively on either. I did once do some digging on the Yang Fuqing claim and found very little to substantiate it, while the Low Yet claim comes from an unreferenced remark in a popular-press book from 1962. While ex-Taiping were certainly part of the waves of trans-Pacific Chinese migration and by extension various criminal and non-criminal societies, I can't verify anything about those two men in particular.

----- __799.3__ -----2022-09-16 23:42:31+08:00:

This was a plot to establish an anti-Qing regime in Guangzhou in 1902, independent of any Tongmenghui involvement and mainly drawing on the old constitutionalists, now fallen from grace after the 1898 coup. I've never written about it myself, but the standard account is [this 1976 article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/311670) by L. Eve Armentrout.

### 800: [Reminds me of the time Matsuri met a Roboco fan in Valorant lmao](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/xfkpzi/reminds_me_of_the_time_matsuri_met_a_roboco_fan/), submitted on 2022-09-16 15:30:52+08:00.

Isn't 'power level' just 4chan speak for how many groups of people you're bigoted against though?

### 801: [Was the Fengtian Clique led by Manchus?](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseHistory/comments/xgwway/was_the_fengtian_clique_led_by_manchus/), submitted on 2022-09-18 04:33:55+08:00.

----- __801.1__ -----2022-09-18 11:10:08+08:00:

The ethnic definitions of 'Manchu' vs 'Han' changed over time. While the 'Banner'/'Manchu' elision had *largely* set in by the fall of the Qing, Zhang and Zhao's specific claims to being Hanjun Bannermen suggests they were still implying something other than full ethnic Manchu status, but rather asserting status as Manchu-adjacent, at least in my view. There's something to the suggestion that Hanjun (as in Han Bannermen) were, under the Qing, originally conceived of as ethnically distinct from the Han writ large, but whether the Fengtian Clique officers understood this is unclear to me.

### 802: [Ming/Qing military governorates](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseHistory/comments/xgx5jd/mingqing_military_governorates/), submitted on 2022-09-18 04:44:38+08:00.

You very much could, and indeed a number of European maps from the 18th and 19th centuries *do* show a distinction between China Proper and Inner Asia for the Qing.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).
