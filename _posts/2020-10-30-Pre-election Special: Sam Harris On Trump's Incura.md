In thinking who might be an ideal first guest for the first Dishcast, and on the eve of an election, Sam came up immediately. Exactly four years ago, in an episode of his podcast titled &#8220;<a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-lesser-evil/">The Lesser Evil</a>&#8221;, we had a rambling discussion that went viral, where we confessed how deeply we loathed Hillary Clinton and how vital nonetheless it was to vote for her against the far greater menace of Donald J Trump. </p><p>In this episode &#8212; the inaugural episode of The Dishcast &#8212; Sam and I pick up the conversation from 2016 by delving deeper into the incomprehensibly foul nature of Trump and the inability of his cult followers to care, and the danger of woke authoritarianism in the wake of Trump. I hope you have as much fun listening as we did chatting. </p><p><em>(You can listen right away in the audio player embedded above, or right below it you can click &#8220;Listen in podcast app&#8221; &#8212; which will connect you to the Dishcast feed, allowing all future episodes to come right to your smartphone.)</em></p><a class="image-link image2 image2-292-1100" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ac382a-13f7-410c-849a-b4f5874fa4e9_1100x292.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ac382a-13f7-410c-849a-b4f5874fa4e9_1100x292.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a5ac382a-13f7-410c-849a-b4f5874fa4e9_1100x292.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:292,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:70351,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-292-1100 {            padding-bottom: 26.545454545454543%;            padding-bottom: min(26.545454545454543%, 292px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-292-1100 img {            max-width: 1100px;            max-height: 292px;          }        </style></a>
