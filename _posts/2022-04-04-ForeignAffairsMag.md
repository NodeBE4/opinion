### 183: [The Fantasy of the Free World: Are Democracies Really United Against Russia?](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/tw3wt7/the_fantasy_of_the_free_world_are_democracies/), submitted on 2022-04-04 22:51:06+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Shivshankar Menon, National Security Adviser to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from 2010 to 2014.\]

"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provoked outrage and unleashed a barrage of economic sanctions from many Western governments. Some, such as Germany, have boosted their military spending after years of riding on American coattails. In these actions, certain analysts have found a silver lining to the devastation of the war in Ukraine. Writing in *Foreign Affairs* in March, Michael Beckley and Hal Brands argued that the international reaction to the invasion would reverberate well beyond the current crisis. The concerted response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions could “consolidate a global alliance that unites democracies against Russia and China and thereby secures the free world for a generation to come.” In this view, Russia’s war in Ukraine might be a pivotal episode in a global contest between autocracy and democracy. Chastened by Putin’s gross violation of norms, democracies will band together in a muscular reaffirmation of the liberal international order.  
That is wishful thinking. The war is no doubt a seismic event that will have profound consequences for Russia, its immediate neighbors, and the rest of Europe. But it will neither reshape the global order nor presage an ideological showdown of democracies against China and Russia. After all, many of the world’s biggest democracies, including India, have so far not joined the U.S.-led economic campaign against Russia or even explicitly condemned the invasion. Far from consolidating “the free world,” the war has underscored its fundamental incoherence. In any case, the future of global order will be decided not by wars in Europe but by the contest in Asia, on which events in Ukraine have limited bearing."

### 184: [The End of the Middle East: How an Old Map Distorts a New Reality](https://old.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/tw42ed/the_end_of_the_middle_east_how_an_old_map/), submitted on 2022-04-04 22:57:52+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Marc Lynch, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University.\]

"U.S. foreign policy remains wedded to a narrow mental map of the Middle East. Since the early years of the Cold War, the Washington establishment has viewed the Middle East as the Arab world—broadly conceived as the member states of the Arab League (with the exception of the geographic outliers Comoros, Mauritania, and Somalia)—plus Iran, Israel, and Turkey. These parameters feel natural to many. Based on geographic continuity, common-sense understandings of the region, and twentieth-century history, this is the Middle East of American university departments and think tanks, as well as of the U.S. State Department.  
But such a map is increasingly outdated. Leading regional powers operate outside the traditional Middle East in much the same way as they operate inside it, and many of the rivalries most important to the region now play out beyond those assumed borders. The Pentagon has long known this: until the creation of U.S. Africa Command in 2007, the region covered by U.S. Central Command, the combatant command that handles the Middle East, included not only Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and the Gulf states but also Afghanistan, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan—a grouping that was directly at odds with the State Department’s Middle East.

Such a dramatic misalignment of the U.S. policymaking and military establishments points to the dangers of clinging to the old model of the region. Not only is the concept out of step with current politics and military practice; it also hampers attempts to confront many of the biggest challenges of the day, from serial refugee crises to Islamist insurgencies to entrenched authoritarianism. Continuing to build scholarship and policy on a legacy definition of the Middle East threatens to blind U.S. strategy to the actual dynamics shaping the region—and, worse, makes Washington all too likely to continue making disastrous blunders there."

### 185: [The End of the Middle East: How an Old Map Distorts a New Reality](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/tw4544/the_end_of_the_middle_east_how_an_old_map/), submitted on 2022-04-04 23:00:48+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Marc Lynch, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University.\]

“The changing dynamics of global power and regional practice are rapidly reorienting many leading Middle Eastern states, and the map they are following is no longer Washington’s; the map is their own. It is now up to Washington to learn to read it.” 

Washington’s conception of the Middle East’s geography is out of step with the region’s politics, warns Marc Lynch. Clinging to an old model hampers attempts to confront serial refugee crises, Islamist insurgencies, and entrenched authoritarianism.
