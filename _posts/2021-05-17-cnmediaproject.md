With all the trumpeting lately of the CCP's history and traditions in the lead-up to the Party's 100th anniversary, it's a good time to read up on an important related phrase, "red genes" (红色基因). CMP's David Bandurski investigates. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/red-genes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/red-genes/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1qLJM4XIAAZkDV?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
