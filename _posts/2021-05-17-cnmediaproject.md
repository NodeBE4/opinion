With all the trumpeting lately of the CCP's history and traditions in the lead-up to the Party's 100th anniversary, it's a good time to read up on an important related phrase, "red genes" (红色基因). CMP's David Bandurski investigates. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/red-genes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/red-genes/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1qLJM4XIAAZkDV?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Celebrations of red culture were really picking up pace in the mid-to-late 2000s, and let's not forget who was really pushing this back in 2008. Remember this guy?<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1qLkQ0XMAE2N6t?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

"Red genes" (红色基因). What are they? Do you have them?

Re A big push right now for study of CCP history (学习党史) in the run-up to the 100th anniversary. A 24-hour image search of the phrase turns up many, many Party history study sessions across the country.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1vA6ZJXsAcylDn?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re And here's an article from the propaganda department of Jiangsu province, talking about all of the "innovative" ways that CCP history is being promoted ahead of the anniversary. Drawing on the inspiration of "red songs" (红歌) is one way. <a href="http://www.ourjiangsu.com/a/20210518/1621387232392.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.ourjiangsu.com/a/20210518/1621387232392.shtml</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1vC7Z_XEAEeJen?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Though let us not forget that red songs were a craze in places like Jiangxi from around the mid-2000s. Jiangxi Satellite TV even launched the “China Red Song Club” (中国红歌会), a singing program to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Long March. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/red-genes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/red-genes/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1vDeacWQAEH_Nz?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re And the biggest innovator on "red songs" was this guy.
