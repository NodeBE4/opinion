An excellent and comprehensive report on how the Chinese Communist Party dismantled Hong Kong's civil society and individual rights.

Yet people in China never vote for their leaders. Oppositions are quashed. Muslim minorities are persecuted and crosses are burnt. That’s how shameless CCP is — falsifying everything.<br><br>Chinese Embassy in UK: The leadership of the CPC is a choice of the people. The CPC is from the people, for the people and by the people. The focus of all its work is always the interests of the people. That’s why the CPC could win the whole-hearted support of all the Chinese people.<br>

“Normally, the first of July was a showcase of civil society and big crowds of Hong Kong people. But today, you can only see a Hong Kong that is being silenced.”<br>Thanks ⁦@joshrogin⁩!<br><br>The Chinese Communist Party’s anniversary is Hong Kong’s funeral <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/01/chinese-communist-party-hong-kong-taiwan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/01/chinese-communist-party-hong-kong-taiwan/</a>
