RT‚ÄÇMareike Ohlberg<br>Since I can't keep tweeting facepalms, here's a question to EU leaders: what's the plan for when the deal is breached either directly or by finding ways around it? Do you have some kind of plan in place for that? Because you're going to need it.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3115588/all-eu-member-states-back-china-investment-deal-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3115588/all-eu-member-states-back-china-investment-deal-sources-say</a>

Re @liu_dimon State media topic to watch . . . How will they cover the investment agreement with the EU? Easy prediction: EU leaders overcame Cold War thinking and US pressure to reach a "win-win" deal, China showed its leadership in a pandemic year, and Xi Thought on Diplomacy works.

As the pandemic year retrospectives roll out, let's not forget this began with coverups and cheerleading by constrained Chinese media. Here are some CMP highlights.
