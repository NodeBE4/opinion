### 259: [What’s the point of doing a bug bounty if the bounty is ineligible for pay?](https://old.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/uqjckx/whats_the_point_of_doing_a_bug_bounty_if_the/), submitted on 2022-05-16 08:23:11+08:00.

If you find an exploit, seems like it might have more value on the open market.

### 260: [Reddit are taking my account and I feel powerless.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/urajre/reddit_are_taking_my_account_and_i_feel_powerless/), submitted on 2022-05-17 08:48:49+08:00.

The good news is that you are not powerless.  At this stage, the mark holder has just said you infringed.  Whether you actually have is far from established.  Even if it was, you have several defenses.  

Here, laches stands out because of how long it's taken Instagram to figure out that you have this account. FFS it's been eleven years at least, right? That is the definition of unreasonable delay.  

What's their strategy?  Sit around like a potted plant for eleven years and all of a sudden issue a trademark claim, after all this time?  Seriously?  What nonsense.  Such diligence.  Vigorous enforcement.  Wow.  

Your response could read something along the lines of . . . . 

COUNTER NOTICE OF IMPROPER CLAIM ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF ALLEGED TRADEMARK RIGHTS

Reddit Legal - 

On information and belief, an alleged trademark holder has issued an improper claim that the username associated with this account, known solely on Reddit as "Instagram."  

By this counter-notice, you are issued a brief explanation as to why I am entitled to use the same.  First, the alleged mark holder has provided no evidence whatsoever tending to establish either (a) the alleged claimant owns a valid and legally protectable mark; or (b) the infringement causes any likelihood of confusion about any source of any goods or services associated therewith.  

Second, even if any such evidence was provided, which it has not been, this account's use thereof is permissible under at least any one or more of the following: descriptive fair use, nominative fair use, laches, the First Amendment and the alleged mark holder's unclean hands and/or trademark misuse.  

Particularly with respect to laches, the alleged holder's eleven-year delay in issuance is self-evidently fatal to any such claim.  Accordingly, and in view of the alleged holder's lack of diligence, the claim is improper and in no way constitutes any lawful challenge to my rights to this username.  

All rights to assert, or further substantiate, these or any other grounds for defense to the alleged holder's claim are explicitly reserved.

Sincerely,

u/instagram

NOTE: Obviously talk to a lawyer.
