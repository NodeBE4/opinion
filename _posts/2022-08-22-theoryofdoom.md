Let the culling come.

Most useful?  Applied math coursework, generally.  

Here's the secret to getting a good job: Math is the back door into pretty much everything.

### 365: [Any writers here? What are you writing atm?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/wv93ua/any_writers_here_what_are_you_writing_atm/), submitted on 2022-08-23 07:47:33+08:00.

I've got two novels going.  One is a political thriller, the other is a coming of age novel.

----- __365.2__ -----2022-08-23 19:32:37+08:00:

The coming of age novel is outlined in an old Black & Red notebook, and I've written the first four chapters in Word.  This was something I started when I was in college, but I have not finished.  

The political thriller is mostly outlined, but I've changed the ending a few times.  This was first outlined in a Black & Red notebook, but I've gone through a couple of different notebooks since then.  I've written 15 chapters in this, only about 5 of which I will probably wind up using.  

I am not a professional writer.  These are side projects.

It's mostly that I work about 60+ hours/week.  There are only so many hours in the day. 

The time will come, though.

### 366: [Five precepts of the Soviet intelligentsia](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/wzq9g1/five_precepts_of_the_soviet_intelligentsia/), submitted on 2022-08-28 16:20:11+08:00.

Wise words.
