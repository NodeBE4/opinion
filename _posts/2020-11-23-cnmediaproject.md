Red Convergence: CMP's reading on last week's insipid China New Media Conference -- and why a CCP-led push for "media convergence" concerns the entire world. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/11/23/red-convergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/11/23/red-convergence/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EngspICWEAYaAKy?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

At last week's China New Media Conference, deputy propaganda minister outline China's "national strategy" for re-building CCP media dominance through "media convergence." CMP breaks down why this matters, not just to domestically but internationally. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/11/23/red-convergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/11/23/red-convergence/</a>

RT Chao Deng<br>Eliminating poverty for the government is a numbers game. China's poverty threshold is ~$600 a year, while World Bank's standard is ~$2000 a year. By the latter, more than a fourth of China's population is still impoverished. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-says-it-has-met-its-deadline-of-eliminating-poverty-11606164540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-says-it-has-met-its-deadline-of-eliminating-poverty-11606164540</a>

Re But most prominent is the report on an award ceremony for "model workers" (劳动模范), a "new era" event with a very old era feel. In his speech, Xi notes it is the 95th anniversary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and 70th anniversary of first "model worker" in 1950.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Enp16uHWEAETn-6?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re At bottom left is the call yesterday between Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The PD has Xi emphasizing that "we all support multilateralism" and "strengthening intl cooperation" to meet global challenges. Vaccine coop also tops the report. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3111215/xi-jinping-calls-germany-europe-remain-open-chinese-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3111215/xi-jinping-calls-germany-europe-remain-open-chinese-companies</a>

Re China's understanding of "multilateralism" (多边主义) deserves careful consideration. In this respect, Xi and Merkel are not speaking the same language. @bueti remark this year about Chinese "serial bilateralism" is arguably a better characterization. <a href="http://eu-asiacentre.eu/events_details.php?event_id=269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://eu-asiacentre.eu/events_details.php?event_id=269</a>
