Re 7. Yesterday, there was a crowd of pro-Beijing thugs ferociously attacked Hongkongers who countered their propaganda campaign in Chinatown. This has shown how the long arm of the Chinese Communist Party is, in effect, trying to erode our democratic tradition to silence dissent.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFRWJGjXsAkbR09?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 8. We should not tolerate these malign forces in our society. I hereby urge the UK govt to investigate all the organizers for traces of infiltration orchastrated by CCP. Meanwhile, all the pro-Beijing attackers should be apprehended and brought to justice.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFRWdcQWUAU3u7U?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
