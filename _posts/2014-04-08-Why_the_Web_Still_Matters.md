   This week Twitter was abuzz with the

    most recent report
   </a>
   from Flurry that showed people spending most of their time on mobile using apps, not the browser:

   Many were quick to once again declare “The Web is Dead,” but I’m not sure that conclusion makes sense, at least for publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
   First off, Flurry’s numbers don’t account for webviews within mobile apps. On my site, Stratechery, 37% of my iOS traffic comes from webviews (Android doesn’t break out the difference), which on Flurry’s chart would fall mostly in the Twitter slice. More mass market sites likely take up some percentage of Facebook time, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   That said, it’s striking how little written content appears on Flurry’s chart; the only category that is primarily about written content is news, and even that includes video. And yet, pageviews on WordPress.com and Jetpack are up 27% year-over-year, new sites ranging from small blogs like Stratechery to huge sites like

   continue to launch and grow, and multiple startups (and competitors!) continue to find writing something worth investing in.
  </p>
  <p>
   So is the web dead or not?
  </p>
  <p>
   I don’t think so, for a few reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The total amount of time spent on a computing device (especially mobile), has and continues to grow significantly. This means that many of the activities on our phones, app or not, are additive to what we previously used a computer for. This makes sense: what makes mobile such a big deal is that instead of a computer being a destination device, it’s now a companion that goes with us everywhere. This is how you square the fact that apps seem to dominate usage even as writing on the web continues to grow. When the entire pie is huge and getting bigger, the total size of any particular slice grows as well, even if it becomes relatively thinner.
