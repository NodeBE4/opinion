  ristotle defined humans as political animals. It is understood that the political act requires an act of demarcation between the inside and outside of the polis; that is, it is the demarcation between the political domain and everything else. Despite being ideologically opposed philosophers, both Carl Schmitt in The Concept of the Political (1927) and Hannah Arendt in The Human Condition (1958) pointed out that any political act inevitably assumes a separation between the issues that deserve to be argued politically and not, as well as the exclusion of the latter.
