**\[Summary of the current article\] From Graeme Smith and Delaney Simon:** The Taliban’s insistence on rolling out more restrictions on women and limiting other fundamental rights and freedoms has sparked an understandable backlash. Some Western officials are increasingly unwilling to countenance the kind of engagement that helped deliver lifesaving assistance in the past year. They want to block development aid, tighten sanctions, and isolate Afghanistan further. Such punitive measures would only hurt the population without changing the Taliban’s stance. No matter how unpleasant the regime in Kabul—and the Taliban’s behavior certainly deserves condemnation—donors should take further steps to stabilize the Afghan economy. To avoid disaster, Western governments must grit their teeth and stop constraining Afghanistan’s chances for development.

### 325: [Germany’s Unlearned Lessons - Berlin Must Reduce Its Dependence Not Just on Russia, But China As Well](https://old.reddit.com/r/u_ForeignAffairsMag/comments/zmcykl/germanys_unlearned_lessons_berlin_must_reduce_its/), submitted on 2022-12-15 13:17:29+08:00.

**From Liana Fix and Thorsten Benner:** As the war in Ukraine rages on, few German politicians would take issue with the assertion that Berlin must reduce its energy dependence on Moscow. In fact, the German government has done so. And rhetorically, at least, German leaders are promising to ease the country’s economic dependence on China, as well. . . . So far, however, Scholz has been reluctant to upset the status quo with Beijing—not least because Russia’s war and high energy prices have taken a toll on the German economy. Large German companies that are heavily dependent on China’s market are keen to expand their operations instead of cutting back. But because its economic ties to China are so deep and complex—far more so than is the case with Russia—Berlin must move forcefully to reduce dependence on Beijing. In particular, the risk of a war over Taiwan leaves Germany dangerously exposed to economic coercion and shocks. This coming February, the German government will publish its first-ever national security strategy. Just ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this is Berlin’s chance to demonstrate that it has drawn the right lessons from the catastrophic failure of its past approach toward Russia. It is time for Germany to lay out a plan to reduce dependence on China by diversifying trade and investment ties and selectively decoupling from China on critical technologies.

### 326: [Statecraft in the Age of Connectivity: How Countries Can Work Together Even When They Disagree - Perspective by Yair Lapid](https://old.reddit.com/r/u_ForeignAffairsMag/comments/zmd7o2/statecraft_in_the_age_of_connectivity_how/), submitted on 2022-12-15 13:31:25+08:00.

**From Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid:** Henry Kissinger insisted that the great dilemma of leadership is that we have to make decisions about the future without knowing what the outcome will be. This dilemma has become very acute in recent years, because the modern nation-state is a static point within an ever-expanding network of other powerful actors. Counterintuitively, the best way to handle this new world is not to work in a less compartmentalized manner but rather a more compartmentalized one. Stop looking at countries as whole units, and instead work with them on the basis of shared challenges and shared interests. This is the essence of the Connectivity Statecraft approach, and this is the direction in which global foreign policy needs to move.

### 327: [Mick Ryan: Russia’s New Theory of Victory - How Moscow Is Trying to Learn From Its Mistakes](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/zn7g3w/mick_ryan_russias_new_theory_of_victory_how/), submitted on 2022-12-16 13:52:28+08:00.

**From Mick Ryan:** "There are plenty of reasons to think that Kyiv can defeat even a revitalized Russian military. Ukraine’s international influence campaigns have been a model for other democracies to study and emulate. The Ukrainians have proven superior to the Russians at adapting and updating their tactics and military institutions. And they have far better morale. War holds no certainties, regardless of previous victories. But if Ukraine can maintain Western support, it can prove that Putin’s new theory of victory is just as misguided as was his last."
