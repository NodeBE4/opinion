### 322: [Olaf Scholz: The Global Zeitenwende - How to Avoid a New Cold War in a Multipolar Era](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/zcye81/olaf_scholz_the_global_zeitenwende_how_to_avoid_a/), submitted on 2022-12-05 13:47:48+08:00.

**From Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany:** Periods of relative peace and prosperity in human history, such as the one that most of the world experienced in the early post–Cold War era, need not be rare interludes or mere deviations from a historical norm in which brute force dictates the rules. And although we cannot turn back the clock, we can still turn back the tide of aggression and imperialism. Today’s complex, multipolar world renders this task more challenging. To carry it out, Germany and its partners in the EU, the United States, the G-7, and NATO must protect our open societies, stand up for our democratic values, and strengthen our alliances and partnerships. But we must also avoid the temptation to once again divide the world into blocs. This means making every effort to build new partnerships, pragmatically and without ideological blinders. In today’s densely interconnected world, the goal of advancing peace, prosperity, and human freedom calls for a different mindset and different tools. Developing that mindset and those tools is ultimately what the Zeitenwende is all about.

### 323: [Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage: Go Slow on Crimea - Why Ukraine Should Not Rush to Retake the Peninsula](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/zf8mzu/liana_fix_and_michael_kimmage_go_slow_on_crimea/), submitted on 2022-12-08 02:09:35+08:00.

**From Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage:** Putin could lose in Kherson, or elsewhere in Ukraine, and accept his losses. He could even lose the Donbas, part of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since 2014, and make do politically. But Putin surely regards losing Crimea and surviving as president as irreconcilable. He will go to great lengths to hold on to Crimea. ... At every moment, Ukraine should make Russia fear an invasion of Crimea. For the time being, however, it is wise to pin and isolate Russian soldiers in Crimea without seeking to reconquer the peninsula. This strategy would give Kyiv a strong position in future negotiations with Russia, possibly convincing the Kremlin to enter such talks in earnest. It would help maintain unity among Ukraine’s Western partners worried about escalation risks. More immediately, Ukraine can try to break up the land bridge to Crimea, separating Russia’s forces in the south from its forces in the east and regaining access to the Sea of Azov. A costly and dangerous campaign to retake the peninsula now might put at risk the counteroffensive Ukraine has been so brilliantly waging since September.
