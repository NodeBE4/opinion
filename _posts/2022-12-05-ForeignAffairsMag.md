### 322: [Olaf Scholz: The Global Zeitenwende - How to Avoid a New Cold War in a Multipolar Era](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/zcye81/olaf_scholz_the_global_zeitenwende_how_to_avoid_a/), submitted on 2022-12-05 13:47:48+08:00.

**From Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany:** Periods of relative peace and prosperity in human history, such as the one that most of the world experienced in the early post–Cold War era, need not be rare interludes or mere deviations from a historical norm in which brute force dictates the rules. And although we cannot turn back the clock, we can still turn back the tide of aggression and imperialism. Today’s complex, multipolar world renders this task more challenging. To carry it out, Germany and its partners in the EU, the United States, the G-7, and NATO must protect our open societies, stand up for our democratic values, and strengthen our alliances and partnerships. But we must also avoid the temptation to once again divide the world into blocs. This means making every effort to build new partnerships, pragmatically and without ideological blinders. In today’s densely interconnected world, the goal of advancing peace, prosperity, and human freedom calls for a different mindset and different tools. Developing that mindset and those tools is ultimately what the Zeitenwende is all about.
