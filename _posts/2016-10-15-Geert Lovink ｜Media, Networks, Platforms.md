  ver the past decade we have seen a development away from separate media towards digital convergence of the classic media streams of text, audio and video towards network technologies. Further integration of infrastructures into platforms has lead to clash of two tendencies: while centralization and control through firewalls, data centres and cables increases, users are expecting more and more direct peer-to-peer relationships. Technology is promising decentralization, yet delivers the opposite. Fancy ‘distributed ledgers’ require decentralized infrastructure, yet the reality is going in the precisely opposite direction, creating a crisis in network theory. As long as people do not own and administrate their own digital infrastructure through mass technical literacy, the blockchain utopia is going to be a hollow one.
