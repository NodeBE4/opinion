> hence young Chinese getting bigger and taller than in the past

don't forget the meet: the larger consumption of meet, especially beef (but not pork)

----- __350.2__ -----2019-06-25 04:36:09+08:00:

tbh the western obsession with cheese is still mysterious to me 

As Chinese, I can live w/o rice or any other ingredients in Chinese cuisines...

> ended up beating my dad by 6 inches (in both dick and height)

Did you compare THAT with your dad? LOL

China is still on track tho. My generation (90's) increased a lot but I'm still amazed by the younger generation (00's). Some of them have 180+ in middle school, especially in the north

Edit: Some Chinese are Lactose intolerance tho, I always feel dizzy after drinking too much milk

----- __350.4__ -----2019-06-25 04:50:59+08:00:

>  essential fats

but why you guys hate the fat in the meat, because it's the different sort of fat (trans fat)?

Lots of people here complain the meat in China contains fat, but to us, we prefer the meat fixed with fat

I've worked in the western style kitchen and it's surprising that they will remove the fat in the meat carefully but ended with mixing a ton of sugar, cheese, and oil... really confuse

I drew a conclusion with my Chinese fellows: the westerners hate the solid fat but don't mind the liquid fat lol

----- __350.5__ -----2019-06-25 05:10:19+08:00:

Just my opinion, but Korean society / personality has a mysterious consistency and accepted a foreign feature quickly once it's started, another example is K-pop

Now Korea is a cult of cheese now, cheesecake, cheese snack, cheese chips, cheese hot pot (I hate this one)

I love banana milk tho

[unrelated topic] I've read some news from Sinoinisider and smell similar because one of their top advisers is [明巨正](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-sg/%E6%98%8E%E5%B1%85%E6%AD%A3)(Taiwan's political science professor). You can get access to his report from youtube channel like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a__9IEY5aWU) for free

----- __350.6__ -----2019-06-25 13:07:17+08:00:

There is a small group of Chinese feeling it gross too but definitely not the general case (anyway I can understand your feeling tho)

It’s more about the texture than taste imo

In China we eat the meat (with fat) with rice. If you eat it lonely, then it’s grosser

### 351: [Despite living here for years, I find many Chinese still hold on to staunch pro china stances](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/c4pgoo/despite_living_here_for_years_i_find_many_chinese/), submitted on 2019-06-24 23:07:19+08:00.

----- __351.1__ -----2019-06-25 03:46:25+08:00:

Am Chinese... This is a HUGE topic which I can list 20+ points. I just picked the ones that are rarely mentioned

1. Their bodies are living in the west but their brains are living in China. They *only* read the news from China because of the language barrier or culture preference

2. [The Century of Humiliation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Century_of_humiliation) makes Chinese are extremely sensitive to the criticism or even opinions from the west. That's why *mind your business* mindset prevails in China (another reason is the traditional Chinese culture which is different from the western civil society) and they believe that the HK/TW/XJ/TB issues are 100% the aftermath of western imperialism/colonialism and should be solved after the turning-back of China. I bet that you were depicted as a bad guy in their brains. I know, someone will argue that China should not hinge on the past. As I have explained many times here, China has a [long-term orientation](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country/china/) and their measurement of history is based on thousands of years. That is, when you think, it's *already* 100 years, they think, it's *only* 100 years.

3. I figure out China has an anachronistic mindset from personal behavior to foreign policy. To some extent, China is like the 18 century's USA. They are having their own versions of *Isolationism*, *Trail of Tears*, and *Manifest Destiny*. When you analyze China's issues, you should not use the prevailing liberalism and contemporary universal values in the west. When you use the ideologies I mentioned above, you probably can understand it more easily.

PS. This is just an academic discussion.

PS. One day China will adjust itself to the contemporary ideology but at first, there must be no GFW

----- __351.2__ -----2019-06-25 04:05:10+08:00:

> China is really a civilization masquerading as a country. 

lol are you Chinese or not? It's the second time I see this description in the west, the first time is from [Martin Jacques' speech](https://www.ted.com/talks/martin_jacques_understanding_the_rise_of_china/transcript?language=en)

----- __351.3__ -----2019-06-26 04:29:26+08:00:

actually the *Chinese medicine* sometimes make sense, I mean, it depends on the specific incident, some of them are fake but some of them are kinda true 

Chinese medicine is *empirical science* and western medicine is *experimental science*

----- __353.1__ -----2019-06-25 13:19:51+08:00:

其实要看怎么的世俗化了，我觉得新疆的一些宗教化的根源是对汉文化/tg的排斥，我并不认为新疆那种宗教化跟中东是一样的，如果在平行宇宙中有一个独立的新疆，那么他们肯定是一个正常的中亚国家，所以你去看看中亚国家的世俗程度就能知道新疆的未来会怎么样

----- __353.2__ -----2019-06-25 23:55:00+08:00:

> 发达国家基督教哪里衰弱了？

这个要看地方

欧洲现在的基督教势力已经薄弱了非常多，许多国家的无神论者超过50%，这是 r/europe 里面的一个[关于欧洲宗教势力变化的图表和讨论](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)，你可以去看看他们特别是年轻一代对宗教的认知 

美国则保守势力和自由势力对半分，红州很多还是bible州，不过随着时间推移应该也会变

总体上而言，我认为人类最终，世俗/无神论是会超过宗教很多的，这点欧洲一直给我信心

若中国明天立即放开宗教，则基督教等外来教肯定会在短时间内上升很多并持续至少半个世纪，但几百年后则肯定又会回归到极度世俗化当中，就像当年的佛教一样

----- __353.3__ -----2019-06-28 04:03:54+08:00:

若这么讲，中国的无神论也不多，中国更多是泛神论\不可知论\祖先崇拜

严格的无神论，学识和逻辑的要求是很高的

----- __354.1__ -----2019-06-26 05:01:25+08:00:

Are you arguing the pro-BJ media are dishonest?

What about the reliability of the deep-green-media (extremely pro-independence)? or even any biased western media?

What do you think of Trump supporters to protest the "fake news" such as BBC, CNN? Or anti-Trump-ers to protest Fox?

I think they have the right to protest but no one has the right to close these media.

Or, do you have any other opinion? Hope I didn't misunderstand your argument

### 370: [How do Chinese people perceive the Automobile market? Do they view foreign cars as premium? Why are local car brands not in the top 3 of brand market share?](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/c72qmc/how_do_chinese_people_perceive_the_automobile/), submitted on 2019-06-30 02:24:13+08:00.

----- __370.1__ -----2019-06-30 04:38:47+08:00:

I'm not an expert in this field but AFAIK Korea is extremely nationalistic which is actually severer than Chinese's IMO. 

We Chinese love the foreign cars just like we love Apple, and we will not let the nationalism affect our consuming choices. Plus, the face culture I guess? Because car is the face of Chinese, especially lots of them drive their cars for business, better brand of the cars is a proof of their healthy financial situation to convince the potential businessmen to invest on them or deal with them. I know it's stupid tho 🤷‍♂️ On the contrary, lots of people from the first world would think more economically  

However, I think Chinese automobile market will follow the steps of its smartphone counterpart, i.e., from foreign product dominating to 50-50 

10 years ago, Chinese people were zealous to the foreign cars, Germany/French brands were classic and reliable, American brands were fancy and powerful, Japanese brands were economic and trusty, and even Korean brands were much better than domestic ones. Now, there is still a foreign brands privilege within Chinese but it's dwindling year by year. 

The backward of Chinese cars should be largely attributed to the lack of traditional automobile technologies (esp. internal combustion engine) which the Japanese/European companies have been working on for decades or even a century. 

However, with the (relatively) rising of qualify control of Chinese car manufacturing, the oversea acquisition of foreign automobile companies ([example: Geely's Completely Acquisition of Volvo From Ford](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/global/03volvo.html)) and the trends of new energy car, we can forecast the Chinese will be more willing to buy Chinese cars, just like we are willing to buy domestic smartphone brands such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Oneplus, etc now. For instance, while Chinese traces Tesla now, lots of them figure out [NIO](https://www.nio.com) is not a bad choice. Actually, if you widen the picture, the game is already on, such as [BYD Double Deck Battery Electric Bus In London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQM0O9Umu48). I mean, the new energy car is a game changer because the traditional automobile manufacturers are losing lots of their existing advantages.

----- __370.2__ -----2019-06-30 06:16:05+08:00:

You're right, the lifetime of automobile is much longer, so is its duration of brand reputation. I think we can take the rising pattern of Japanese/Korean automobiles for reference in this case

However, the business model of automobile changes fast too. It's not only involving the manufacturing but also a connection with 5G, AI, and IoT. Lots of tech giants are investing heavily in automobile because they believe it would be a new core platform of IoT ecosystem. 

China's domestic policy, such as the automobile emission policy, are pushing Chinese to change their cars to the new energy ones. They're increasing the changing rate of domestic automobile market.

Anyway, I'm not a big fan of automobile tho. But I hear my dad, who loves automobile, kept talking about the rising of quality of domestic automobile since 5 years ago so I think it can reflect a bit the changing word-of-mouth among Chinese customers, although my family still owns the old-school British MG7 lol

Sorry I'm not going to defend XJ camps but your words make me laugh

Indians dropped from 100% to [1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_social_statistics_of_Native_Americans) nowadays of course you can just give them reservations and nobody calls for independence movement. If China use your logic, whether they can decrease Uyghurs population to 1% of XJ and then give them reservations for compensation?

Oh sorry, I forgot to mention that China, at least Qing dynasty, [begin to govern XJ in the mid-18th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty), when the US HASN'T been founded. Not to mention China has governed XJ several times dating back to thousands of years ago such as Tang and Han dynasty.

ok, but sounds same as Han's colonization in XJ
