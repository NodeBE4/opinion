In the first edition of The Journal of the European Association for Chinese Studies, David Bandurski looks at how the CCP struggles to deal not just with criticism but with the dangerous implications of praise and insincerity.  A look at 高级黑 and 低级红. <a href="https://journals.univie.ac.at/index.php/jeacs/issue/view/354/74" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://journals.univie.ac.at/index.php/jeacs/issue/view/354/74</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ev792KrXcAMjx0F?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The next piece in the journal, p. 239, is a must-read from @NDLoubere on censorship in academic scholarship on China. "The New Censorship, the New Academic Freedom: Commercial Publishers and the Chinese Market."

The buzzword of the day is "high-quality development" (高质量发展). Tops PD print edition and online. In its current context the phrase dates back to the 19th National Congress of the CCP in 2017. But it has been used for decades.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ev8aGBgXYAAyLFQ?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

State media are now calling China's supposed eradication of extreme poverty an “earthly miracle" (人间奇迹). What can external propaganda about the campaign tell us about its core objectives?
