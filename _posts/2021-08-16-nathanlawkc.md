While China's actively making friends with Taliban, HKG is arresting students for "advocating terrorism" because of their speeches. <br>How sarcastic it is.<br><br>Four Hong Kong students arrested for ‘advocating terrorism’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/18/four-hong-kong-students-arrested-for-advocating-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/18/four-hong-kong-students-arrested-for-advocating-terrorism</a>

Thank you @BritishVogue  for featuring my story as #MrVogue in the #Septemberissue. We need to call for larger accountabilities to authoritarian governments and protect democratic values as global democracy dwindles. <br>Hope that my story can spark more action.<br>#StandwithHongKong<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9K0ThwWQAEypDx?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

1. Let me tell you what has happened to Hong Kong's top university students, who were charged with "advocating terrorism," and you will realize how dictatorial Hong Kong has become. Bails are denied and they could face years in prison.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9L6OuBWQAMw2cd?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. Beijing is using the pretext of "terrorism" to frame and suppress all grievances and opposition directed towards the government. Following the imprisonment of legislators and the forced dissolution of the major civil society groups, students are the next to be targeted.

Re 4. The Hong Kong government sees our younger and vocal generations as terrorists, while police violence is neglected or even praised by the authorities. What kind of a government is this?<br><br>-END

Horrifying.<br><br>//The Taliban have already stopped women from working in other provinces and ordered families to hand over their daughters to be “married” to fighters//<br><br>Back to the past – How will the Taliban rule Afghanistan this time? <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/08/16/how-will-the-taliban-rule-afghanistan-this-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/08/16/how-will-the-taliban-rule-afghanistan-this-time</a>
