As China growled and screamed last month about US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landing in Taiwan, state media called the trip not a "visit" but a "sneaky visit," or cuanfang (窜访). Read all about the CCP history of the "sneaky visit" in our CMP Dictionary. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/sneaky-visit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/sneaky-visit/</a>

In case you missed it: China’s Quiet Fury Over Xinjiang. In external propaganda, China has been angry and outspoken over the UN report on human rights in Xinjiang . . . . Internally?

The People's Daily has rarely in the reform era had such a sustained stretch of full frontal attacks on the US for its failures as we have seen in recent years. The onslaught continues today with a commentary on US policy in Iraq. <a href="https://bit.ly/3eqwT8O" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3eqwT8O</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fb71arraAAAkBHh?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Pelosi's visit to Taiwan last month could not be just a "visit" for the Chinese Communist Party. It had to be a "sneaky visit" (窜访), so that all stories mentioning it implied its illegitimacy and a position of disgust.
