<p>In September I announced <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/sharp-tech-and-stratechery-plus/">Sharp Tech and Stratechery Plus</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://sharptech.fm/">Sharp Tech with Ben Thompson</a> was a new podcast hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewsharp">Andrew Sharp</a> and myself, about how technology works, and the ways it is impacting the world. Sharp Tech includes both free and paid episodes.</li><li>Stratechery Plus was a re-branding of a Stratechery subscription, which would now include not only <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/daily-email/">Stratechery Updates</a>, but also <a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">Stratechery Interviews</a>; <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>, the twice-weekly 15-minute show I host with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>; and Sharp Tech.</li></ul><p>I am very pleased to announced the latest addition to the Stratechery Plus bundle: <a href="https://sharpchina.fm/">Sharp China with Sinocism&#8217;s Bill Bishop</a>:</p><p><a href="http://sharpchina.fm"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sharp China with Sinocism&#039;s Bill Bishop" width="640" height="640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9926" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?resize=630%2C630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-China-Yellow.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p><p><em>Sharp China with Sinocism&#8217;s Bill Bishop</em> is a collaboration between Stratechery and <a href="https://sinocism.com/">Sinocism</a>. Sharp China is, like <a href="https://sharptech.fm/">Sharp Tech</a>, hosted by Andrew Sharp;<sup id="rf1-9975"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/stratechery-plus-adds-sharp-china-with-sinocisms-bill-bishop/#fn1-9975" title="Sharp China is the first addition to the Stratechery Plus bundles that I do not personally appear on regularly" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> just as Sharp Tech seeks to provide a better understanding of the tech industry through an engaging and approachable conversational format, Sharp China seeks to do the same with everything China-related, and there is no better person to provide this understanding than Sinocism&#8217;s Bill Bishop.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/niubi">Bill Bishop</a> is an entrepreneur and former media executive with more than a decade’s experience living and working in China. Since leaving Beijing in 2015, he has lived in Washington DC. Bishop previously wrote the Axios China weekly newsletter and the China Insider column for the New York Times Dealbook and, in the late 1990s, co-founded MarketWatch.com.</p><p>Bishop founded Sinocism in 2012 to provide investors, policymakers, executives, analysts, diplomats, journalists, scholars and others a comprehensive overview of what is happening in China; Bishop reads Chinese fluently, and provides summaries of reports from not just the U.S. but China as well. I personally find Sinocism essential, but what I have always hoped for were more of Bishop&#8217;s opinions on the news: I&#8217;m excited that Sharp China will give him room for just that.</p><p>While Sharp China <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/announcing-sharp-china-with-sinocisms-bill-bishop/">launched in beta last week</a> for Stratechery Plus and Sinocism subscribers, today we are announcing it to everyone, and making the latest episode about <a href="https://sharpchina.fm/member/article/the-state-of-dynamic-zero-covid-and-reactions-to-that-pro-publica-report">The State of Dynamic Zero-COVID</a> free to listen to. In addition, you can listen to excerpts from the first two shows.</p><p>To add the show to your podcast player, please <a href="https://stratechery.passport.online/member">log in to your member account</a>, or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4PGk72vZmL2uHwUB8Yqssk">listen in Spotify</a>. Sharp China will publish most weeks going forward. You can also email questions for Bill to <a href="mailto:email@sharpchina.fm">email@sharpchina.fm</a>; I&#8217;ve been really pleased with the mailbag segments of Sharp Tech, and I look forward to listening to them on Sharp China as well.<sup id="rf2-9975"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/stratechery-plus-adds-sharp-china-with-sinocisms-bill-bishop/#fn2-9975" title="If you have any issues adding Sharp China to your podcast player please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@stratechery.com&quot;&gt;support@stratechery.com&lt;/a&gt;" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p><p>Once again, to receive every episode of Sharp China, along with Stratechery Updates and Interviews, Sharp Tech, and Dithering, <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">subscribe to Stratechery Plus</a>.
