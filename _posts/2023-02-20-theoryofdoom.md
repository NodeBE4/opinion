### 475: [My Boy Biscuit is tired today guys! Send him some boops!!](https://old.reddit.com/r/trashpandas/comments/117hffo/my_boy_biscuit_is_tired_today_guys_send_him_some/), submitted on 2023-02-21 03:04:28+08:00.

Content like this is why r/trashpandas is is one of three subreddits I am invested in.

### 476: [Rattled by CCP, U.S. and allies are beefing up defenses in the Pacific: But ‘everything needs to go faster,’ says Indo-Pacific command’s top general](https://old.reddit.com/r/NewColdWar/comments/117q97u/rattled_by_ccp_us_and_allies_are_beefing_up/), submitted on 2023-02-21 09:06:25+08:00.

----- __476.1__ -----2023-02-21 13:35:33+08:00:

Meanwhile, our so-called commander in chief is asleep at the wheel.  A source of great reassurance.

### 477: [I want to read Tolstoy's religious works soon, pls suggest me a book aside from](https://old.reddit.com/r/tolstoy/comments/117xtzv/i_want_to_read_tolstoys_religious_works_soon_pls/), submitted on 2023-02-21 15:47:48+08:00.

----- __477.1__ -----2023-02-22 15:04:09+08:00:

As kudiagnola suggested, I would focus on The Kingdom of God Is Within You.

I would also suggest What I Believe.

I know of few restatements of Christianity that are better.

### 478: [Commentators Push Unfounded Claims About Ohio Train Derailment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Disinfo/comments/11b5xet/commentators_push_unfounded_claims_about_ohio/), submitted on 2023-02-25 07:46:57+08:00.

----- __478.1__ -----2023-02-25 14:30:21+08:00:

Lot of incorrect and misleading information in that article.  Clearly written by someone without a technical background.  

We need to check these things more carefully.  A fact check should focus on, as the name suggests, facts.  Not partisan nonsense.

### 479: [My current selection. Which one are you grabbing first?](https://old.reddit.com/r/guitars/comments/11bmnew/my_current_selection_which_one_are_you_grabbing/), submitted on 2023-02-25 22:45:58+08:00.

----- __479.1__ -----2023-02-26 02:25:00+08:00:

Same, because it's what I'd usually go to.  

But I might try the les paul, for a test drive.

----- __479.2__ -----2023-02-26 03:00:30+08:00:

I favor strats, as well.  Specifically my EOB with the sustainer pickup.  Or a classic strat.  Any strat, really.

### 480: [What is the most bullshit profession that actually exists?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11btq7y/what_is_the_most_bullshit_profession_that/), submitted on 2023-02-26 03:43:16+08:00.

----- __480.1__ -----2023-02-26 13:14:54+08:00:

Professional fall guy.  Someone who is hired, for the purpose of assuming responsibility for a failure that has already occurred but is not yet public.
