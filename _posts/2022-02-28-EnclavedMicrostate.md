### 174: [How do you think history would have turned out if Alexander named a successor?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t3ctq5/how_do_you_think_history_would_have_turned_out_if/), submitted on 2022-02-28 18:46:08+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).

### 175: [What are some historical examples of worst backfires of military campaigns?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t3d5a1/what_are_some_historical_examples_of_worst/), submitted on 2022-02-28 19:06:53+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 176: [In the Ridley Scott film Kingdom of Heaven, Baldwin IV of Jerusalem is depicted wearing an ornate mask to hide his leprosy. Did the actual King Baldwin feel the need to conceal his condition in this way? How would contemporaries have perceived leprosy, and was this a cause of stigma against him?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t3g7st/in_the_ridley_scott_film_kingdom_of_heaven/), submitted on 2022-02-28 21:58:11+08:00.

Thanks! One thing I wanted to ask is about the two Islamic sources you quote from: both seem particularly hostile to Baldwin and cite his illness as part of it, and I was curious whether his leprosy was a cause of contempt in itself to these writers, or if they had a more general antipathy to Crusader rulers and Baldwin's leprosy happened to be one aspect they could seize on?

Thanks!

### 177: [To celebrate Miko's birthday on March 5, a double-decker bus in Hong Kong is sporting a special Miko livery! More info in comments.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/t3j200/to_celebrate_mikos_birthday_on_march_5_a/), submitted on 2022-03-01 00:09:00+08:00.

----- __177.1__ -----2022-03-01 03:17:47+08:00:

It's supposed to run for 2 or 3 weeks still, I'd presume it's not being redacted.

----- __177.2__ -----2022-03-01 03:19:00+08:00:

As another HKniki, I do feel I need to give credit where it's due to our counterparts in Taiwan [who are doing 3 buses across 3 separate cities](https://twitter.com/fuwafuwa_35/status/1497530882923528192).

----- __177.3__ -----2022-03-01 10:58:26+08:00:

For what it's worth it was patched up within a couple of days.
