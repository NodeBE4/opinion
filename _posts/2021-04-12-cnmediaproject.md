RT Stephanie Studer<br>More than 1 in 3 children in China experience the prolonged absence of at least one parent, almost always due to migration. Since 2016 officials have paid attention to the plight of these left-behind children. But systems of support are thinly stretched. <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/04/08/the-plight-of-chinas-left-behind-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.economist.com/china/2021/04/08/the-plight-of-chinas-left-behind-children</a>

The chilling story last week of a 2017 murder exposed the lengths to which some families go to circumvent regulations mandating cremations over burials. The story was quickly deleted, and one of the authors, a university student, was sought by police. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/04/11/a-murder-to-ensure-a-proper-burial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/04/11/a-murder-to-ensure-a-proper-burial/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eyyheb1XIAM2b9F?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Important to bear in mind that this sort of national top-down release of propaganda slogans was not seen in China from 1978 through to 2019, when the CCP released a list of 70 slogans for the 70th anniversary of the PRC.
