### 333: [Ivo H. Daalder and James Goldgeier: The Long War in Ukraine - The West Needs to Plan for a Protracted Conflict With Russia](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/10762ke/ivo_h_daalder_and_james_goldgeier_the_long_war_in/), submitted on 2023-01-09 13:41:48+08:00.

**From Ivo H. Daalder and James Goldgeier:** "So far, Washington and its allies have appropriately focused on the immediate task of helping Ukraine and avoiding escalation. But there is a pressing need to consider the longer term, and to develop policies towards both Russia and Ukraine based on the emerging reality that this war is likely to continue for quite some time. Rather than assuming that the war can be ended through triumph or talks, the West needs to contemplate a world in which the conflict continues with neither victory nor peace in sight. In such a world, the United States and its allies will need to continue providing Ukraine with military support to defend against further Russian aggression. They will need to contain Russia’s larger ambitions by maintaining economic sanctions and isolating Moscow diplomatically. And they will need to ensure that the conflict does not escalate.  At the same time, they will need to lay a long-term basis for security and stability in Europe. That will require integrating Ukraine fully into the West while forging a containment policy that emphasizes both deterrence of Russian aggression and efforts to engage Moscow to avoid the escalation of the war to a broader military confrontation that no one wants. Balancing a Ukraine policy with a Russia policy will be challenging over the long-term, but both endeavors will be essential to the future of European security."
