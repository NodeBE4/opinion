### 244: [How to Vaccinate Behind Enemy Lines: To Stop the Pandemic, the World Will Need to Work With Bad Actors](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/uqxw3r/how_to_vaccinate_behind_enemy_lines_to_stop_the/), submitted on 2022-05-16 22:59:09+08:00.

"By now, it is well known that the world is struggling with unequal access to vaccines. In high-income countries, roughly 75 percent of people are now fully vaccinated. But in low- and lower-middle-income countries, logistical troubles continue to plague the rollout of vaccines, and less than 35 percent of people have received a complete set of shots.  


To try to close this gap, wealthy countries and international institutions have focused on partnering with less affluent states. They have funded and donated doses to the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access program, or COVAX, which allocates shots to poorer countries. Sometimes, they’ve given out vaccines and aid directly. But although such efforts are important, the current system’s focus on working with and through states overlooks some of the world’s most vulnerable people: the 60–80 million people who live in areas outside of formal governmental control.  


To reach these people is a daunting task—and not just because it requires dealing with violent actors and moving vaccines through conflict zones. Current counterterrorism restrictions in the United States and many other leading donor countries bar international aid agencies from providing any group designated as a terrorist organization with “material support.” This broad definition means that aid organizations cannot easily get doses into areas governed by such groups. To truly vaccinate the world against COVID-19 and prevent the outbreak of deadly new variants, the United States and other governments will need to do more than just donate shots and finance efforts to distribute them. They will need to understand that their laws regarding terrorist groups are making it more difficult to end the pandemic."

"Two and a half years into the pandemic, China is rapidly losing its battle to maintain its “zero COVID” goal. The government’s total lockdown of Shanghai, its largest city and financial hub, has created economic chaos and engendered social backlash from tens of millions of residents who have been prevented from going outside, even to obtain food or to seek health care. Despite such protocols, the government was unable to prevent hundreds of thousands of new cases from emerging in the city during the lockdown, while causing much unnecessary hardship and suffering. Now a similar problem threatens the capital itself. Unwilling to acknowledge the changing nature of the virus, the Chinese government continues to claim that it can outrace the virus through extreme containment measures, even amid growing popular discontent.  


For all countries, COVID-19 of course remains a public health problem. But for China, the chief risks of the virus have become less epidemiological than political and economic. As the experience of other countries has shown, with appropriate strategies in place the Omicron variant can be managed and contained. But the Chinese government insists on maintaining policies that are unsustainable and have little grounding in science. In doing so, it has shown an increasing willingness to put China’s economy, and even its social stability, at risk.  


For Chinese President Xi Jinping, the stakes could not be higher. The all-important 20th Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Congress is scheduled for later this year, and the purported success of Beijing’s COVID-fighting strategy has been a central part of state propaganda almost since the pandemic began. If Beijing loses the trust and support of the public on this core issue—at a time when the Chinese economy itself is suffering from continual lockdown shocks—a regime once known for its technocratic efficiency could soon face a growing legitimacy crisis."
