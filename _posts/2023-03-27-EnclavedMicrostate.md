Cantonese for HK, Hokkien for Taiwan. Done and dusted.

I mean Bae speaks Cantonese at home, just not on stream.

> Almost all of those are in Taiwan.

Maybe it's my local bias but I feel like it's a roughly 50/50 HK-TW split, at least historically. This year seems a bit quieter than last.

### 1165: [How did the creation of the video game "Pong" impact the construction of the Great Wall of China?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1280sog/how_did_the_creation_of_the_video_game_pong/), submitted on 2023-04-01 05:50:54+08:00.

This is a surprisingly rich story, involving three court ministers, Ping, Pong, and Pang, in the time of the emperor Altoum. Now, Altoum is not exactly a very Chinese name, and there is a reason for that – the events in question took place during the short-lived Western Yi Dynasty, a brief and obscure period principally known through the private chronicle of 普只尼, established by an Inner Asian tribe of uncertain origin. Like many states in China founded by Inner Asian polities, the ruling dynasty in turn found itself at threat from the steppe that it had left behind, as new tribes emerged to fill the gap. By Altoum's time, this was becoming dire, as the collapse of the Tartarian Empire of Tamerlane had created fierce competition in the steppe that threatened to spill into his territories, and the emperor struggled with the problem of how to explain to these roaming nomads that his nice neat border was not to be traversed.

It was around this time that Ping, Pong, and Pang were working on the development of a new sport that could be played in a limited space. In its first iteration, three players would circle around a round table carrying frying pans, which they would use to hit a ball across the table between them. A pass was only valid if the ball bounced once, but if it missed the table or bounced twice, the player who had just attempted to pass had lost, and the player who had last passed to them had won.

This was deemed somewhat unwieldy, and so gradually there was a shift towards wooden paddles for convenience, followed by a more radical step of replacing the round table with a rectangular one with a net across the middle, and changing the game to one of two players. Pang, unfortunately, tended to be the one left to referee at the side. This was to have rather unfortunate consequences in the long term, but more immediately, when the game was completed, Ping and Pong chose to publicise the game without crediting Pang. Henceforth, it was to be known as The Game of Ping and Pong, or merely Ping-Pong for short.

But Ping appears not to have reckoned that his connivance with Pong would later backfire on him. Pong had come to discover the remarkable bounciness of steel against steel, and privately developed his own variant of Ping-Pong in a small frame, with one sliding block on each side that would be used to deflect a steel ball, initially actuated using a springloaded mechanism. Pong then took his invention to the court without Ping, presenting it as The Game of Pong, which he invited the emperor to try.

As the game progressed, however, Altoum noted that it was odd that there was a line across the middle of the Pong board, that seemed to serve no useful purpose. He had, however, heard rumours of a Game of Ping and Pong where the table had a central net that could catch the ball mid-flight, and was curious about whether that had influenced the line's inclusion. Sensing possible danger should he give the wrong answer, Pong improvised: the point of the Game of Pong was not merely sport, but indeed a philosophical tool, intended to teach the lesson that the mere drawing of a line does not, in itself, affect the physical world.

This proved to be an apt statement, as Altoum appears to have had a eureka moment at that point, realising that the mere existence of a border would not stop raiding; he needed to actively prohibit movement. He needed to build a wall. And so it was that the Game of Pong led to the construction of a (not quite *the*) great wall in northern China.

But there is, however, a tragicomic coda to all this. Pang, jilted by his former friends, stole Pong's research into steel elasticity, and travelled into the steppe, where he made contact with the Muslim warlord A'Tari, bringing with him a proposal for a new siege engine. A steel ball, initially launched by a catapult, would be repeatedly reflected against a large steel plate, allowing a wall to slowly be worn down, brick by brick. Unfortunately, a lack of access to sufficient steel meant that in practice, instead of a plate large enough to reflect the ball consistently, there was instead a smaller plate that would have to be moved by gantry to meet the ball every time it bounced off the target wall. Any failure to intercept the ball as it rolled back could be fatal to the operators, and it was deemed that any more than three lives lost in this way meant the siege should be called off.

And so it was that Pang, the forgotten colleague of Ping and Pong, invented Breakout.
