### 951: [Is it just me or does irys 2.0 look like irys 1.0's younger sister](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/z68emw/is_it_just_me_or_does_irys_20_look_like_irys_10s/), submitted on 2022-11-28 02:21:41+08:00.

Maybe, but not in this comparison. 2.0RyS on the right there is giving off immense Ara-Ara vibes.

### 952: [Cartoon by David Lowe (8 juli 1936) about run-up to WW II. Can someone analyse this thoroughly and/or just explain the meaning behind it?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z6vofh/cartoon_by_david_lowe_8_juli_1936_about_runup_to/), submitted on 2022-11-28 20:46:45+08:00.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

If so, Xenophon and Aristophanes were in on the joke as well, which is unlikely at best. The Socrates of Plato is difficult to tease apart from Socrates the historical person, but that's different from saying Socrates didn't exist at all.

### 954: [[Opera] 'So adventurous a tale, Which may rank with most romances' – The Mikado, comic opera's biggest and most controversial hit](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z8nzhe/opera_so_adventurous_a_tale_which_may_rank_with/), submitted on 2022-11-30 18:22:07+08:00.

For a bit of extra trivia I couldn't fit into the writeup itself, the one semi-genuine Japanese song in *The Mikado* is the one titled 'Mi-ya sa-ma', a somewhat re-keyed version of a military tune titled 'Ton-yare Bushi', also known as 'Miyasan', written during the Boshin War in 1868. The titular *Miyasan* (imperial prince) almost certainly referred to Komatsu Akihito, the ceremonial commander-in-chief of the imperial armies, who, as the story goes may well have been in attendance during *The Mikado*'s opening run.

### 955: [[Opera] 'So adventurous a tale, Which may rank with most romances' – Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado, comic opera's biggest and most controversial hit](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z8o4bz/opera_so_adventurous_a_tale_which_may_rank_with/), submitted on 2022-11-30 18:30:14+08:00.

For a bit of extra trivia I couldn't fit into the writeup itself, the one semi-genuine Japanese song in The Mikado is the one titled ['Mi-ya sa-ma'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAxVQMvFU3Y) used for the entry of the Mikado in Act II, a somewhat re-keyed version of a military tune titled 'Ton-yare Bushi', bettern known as ['Miyasan'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6CIdHLahq4), written during the Boshin War in 1868. The titular Miyasan (imperial prince) almost certainly referred to Komatsu Akihito, the ceremonial commander-in-chief of the imperial armies, who, as the story goes may well have been in attendance during The Mikado's opening run.
