RT Paul Mozur 孟建國<br>The most important clearinghouse account for censored protest videos inside China appears to have been shadowbanned on Twitter. Search for @whyyoutouzhele and only fake accounts come up.

In the latest CMP Dictionary entry, intern Deng Xinyu looks at how the word “socialite” (媛) has in recent years become a misogynistic umbrella term used online — and in state media — to disparage women who advertise fancy lifestyles. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/socialite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/socialite/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjWPAOfaUA0snnI?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

During the first five days of December, Xi Jinping was entirely off the front page of the People's Daily — as Jiang Zemin's death cooled the discourse. But he's back with a vengeance now: today's front page.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjlXV50akAAf9T-?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re This is Xi Jinping at the first China-Arab Summit. So not exactly a surprise to see the pages dominated with handshakes. As always at the People's Daily, layouts are dictated by political signaling, not pleasant design choices.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjlYKsTagAAJsIN?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re But things get so much more exciting on page three. . . . Wait, hold on. No, more handshakes and identical headlines.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjlYX2haUAE1SeD?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Nearly this entire edition of the People's Daily is about the summit. And the Riyadh Declaration (首届中阿峰会利雅得宣言) from the summit is certainly worth a closer look. <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-12/10/nw.D110000renmrb_20221210_1-05.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-12/10/nw.D110000renmrb_20221210_1-05.htm</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FjlZbbkaAAAGseF?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
