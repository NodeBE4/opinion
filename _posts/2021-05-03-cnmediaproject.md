RT Sixth Tone<br>Looking back at the history of Sino-international diplomatic relations, there’s a long tradition of “loyal betrayals,” often the result of a translator’s loyalty to the language, if not to established diplomatic protocols and speech. <a href="http://ow.ly/qA2o50ECFtB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://ow.ly/qA2o50ECFtB</a>

On World Press Freedom Day, the word "press freedom" is nowhere to be found in China's media. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/05/03/when-press-freedom-is-unspeakable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/05/03/when-press-freedom-is-unspeakable/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0eprCvWQAM6_Bv?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

On World Press Freedom Day, or most other days, don’t expect to read the words “freedom of the press” anywhere in China’s media. The taboo phrase is now exceptionally rare, and reserved mostly for criticism of the West. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/05/03/when-press-freedom-is-unspeakable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/05/03/when-press-freedom-is-unspeakable/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0fCSc7WUAYsuAW?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
