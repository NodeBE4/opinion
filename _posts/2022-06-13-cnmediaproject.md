Xi Jinping is now routinely referred to as the "core" of the CCP leadership. What does this mean? Why does it matter? Read up in our latest CMP Dictionary entry. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/the-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/the-core/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVGs9IGacAAIW4Y?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Example today: the "core" phrase is used repeatedly on Page 11 on the People's Daily today, in three separate articles.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVGtJENacAA40Ik?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re One of these is very much worth a read also as an explication of the phrase "matters of national importance" (国之大者), which can double as a reference to Xi himself that might translate "great man of the nation."

Re 国之大者 is a Xi utterance that references Louis Cha's notion of the “great man of chivalry” (侠之大者) in the Wuxia genre. This is a character that shows pluck and courage in fighting injustices.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVGu9U1acAAI8gk?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Runako Celina<br>Re I was living in Beijing at the time this video was circulated and like many people of African descent across China watched it with horror, wondering why, how, who and where - no one seemed to know all the answers - but we all wanted to.

Re @SylvieXBB @MariaRepnikova This is just awful. But very important that you have documented it. Have you published related research anywhere?

State media coverage of a sector report by the All-China Journalism Association emphasized the development of media convergence. But the report tells another important story -- about a rapid fall in the number of licensed journalists in China. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/06/14/steep-decline-for-chinas-journalists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/06/14/steep-decline-for-chinas-journalists/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVMe5yhagAAEMmO?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Xi Jinping is referenced in 8 articles today in the People's Daily as "the core." What does this mean?
