Xi Jinping is now routinely referred to as the "core" of the CCP leadership. What does this mean? Why does it matter?

Re One of these is very much worth a read also as an explication of the phrase "matters of national importance" (国之大者), which can double as a reference to Xi himself that might translate "great man of the nation."

Re 国之大者 is a Xi utterance that references Louis Cha's notion of the “great man of chivalry” (侠之大者) in the Wuxia genre. This is a character that shows pluck and courage in fighting injustices.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVGu9U1acAAI8gk?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
