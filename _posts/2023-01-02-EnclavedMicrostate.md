I suspect it is probably Hong Kong Dollars, which would translate to US$5.25 at current exchange rates. Then again I usually see 'Oreo' simply rendered as 'Oreo' over here, so it could be Singapore Dollars in which case S$41=US$30.63 or so.

### 1021: [New Year, New Me - Weekly Discussion Thread, 3rd January 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/101goor/new_year_new_me_weekly_discussion_thread_3rd/), submitted on 2023-01-03 00:27:39+08:00.

ID isn't much EU-friendlier than North America-based talents; the time gap is about the same but in the opposite direction, and not everyone has Kaela's insane work 'ethic' where they essentially stream 24/7. I've been able to catch Zeta a lot but that's because I'm on a university student's schedule and have relatively high flexibility.

And it's also not universally the case that ID is essentially an EN extension – I know Zeta, Reine, and to a great extent Ollie to be relatively EN-heavy, but on the other hand you have relatively Bahasa-heavy members like Kobo and Iofi. I've not watched enough of Moona, Risu, Anya, or Kaela to really get a strong sense of language balance there. On a related note it's not implausible that those with stronger accents get passed over a bit, either (more accusatorily) because of some level of prejudice, or (more charitably) because it can require a little more attention to hear them properly. An added element is that some may be thrown off by the presence of any significant stretch of non-English language use and would prefer to be able to grasp the stream as a whole, but given IRyS' popularity despite her relative bilinguality, that may not be the case – or viewers tolerate Japanese more.

Then we have to throw in the mix that collabs within HoloID are basically non-English even between the English-heavy members. If part of the draw of following a particular agency streamer is also the prospect of their bouncing off other members of the same agency relatively frequently, then it can be a little frustrating if those interactions are basically never in your language.

It's also misleading to look at the r/hololive portion of the fandom and presume that the wider fandom is necessarily of similar mind. I rarely see much in the way of ID engagement by EN viewers on Twitter, and I suspect that anyone who is a relatively passive viewer, only really engaging via Youtube and not as active in fandom spaces, will a) not see much reason to click on a streamer with 'hololive-ID' prominently displayed, and b) may well not be recommended HoloID streamers by the algorithm.

So I don't doubt there's probably aspects of 'exoticism'/racism/lighter prejudice involved, but there's a few practicalities to it too, which is unfortunate because Zeta is great and everyone should watch her we are not a cult #ZETANISM2023

### 1022: [How did Imperial Russia first expand across, then maintain order and supplies to, its vast Siberian empire?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/101wuib/how_did_imperial_russia_first_expand_across_then/), submitted on 2023-01-03 11:29:40+08:00.

> Following the demise of the Silk Road, the steppe descending into generalized economic crisis and endemic warfare.

This is heavily questionable. There's a revisionist school of historians of Central Asia, most prominently Scott C. Levi, who have problematised our notions of the Silk Road, to the point of [arguing that it never existed at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jsb5my/whats_the_state_of_scholarship_on_the_silk_road/gbyl2uc/) in the form popularly imagined. In any event, the apparent secular decline of Central Asia in the 18th century that culminated in the slow collapse of the Bukharan Khanate was followed by the rise of Kokand and Khiva as powers in their own right with considerable regional influence.

### 1023: [The bogdanoff twins’ looks scare me](https://old.reddit.com/r/oddlyterrifying/comments/102siol/the_bogdanoff_twins_looks_scare_me/), submitted on 2023-01-04 11:23:09+08:00.

Science communicators more than scientists as such. They did hold PhDs but the awarding of them was controversial to say the least, and the procedure extremely irregular. Youtuber BobbyBroccoli did [a two-part series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAB-wWbHL7VurPf2npHah-H8aHBYvd55e) on the Bogdanoffs' PhD controversy which is a good watch.

The puppets were made by the studio behind '80s British satirical show [Spitting Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_Image), which was well known for its grotesque caricatures of politicians and celebrities – both visual in the form of the puppets, and audial in the form of the impressionists doing the voices. In particular, Steve Nallon had a [terrifyingly on-point rendition of Margaret Thatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThkVqCYdR0Y) (though unfortunately he seems to be a bit of a milkshake duck these days and has associations with GB News, which is basically the UK's attempt at creating its own Fox News).

### 1024: [Look at all of those lambos](https://old.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1034jpg/look_at_all_of_those_lambos/), submitted on 2023-01-04 22:08:59+08:00.

It’s more or less true of crypto too. Bitcoin peaked in 2017 and then slumped, and throughout 2018-19 it wasn’t uncommon to joke that it had become completely worthless. Then the speculator bubble of 2020 came, and then that finally popped, much to the delight of all of us over at r/Buttcoin. As Marx sort of said, events in history often happen twice: first as tragedy, then as farce.

### 1025: [What do Historians think caused the acceleration of certain technological advances (gunpowder, glass, massive infrastructure) in places like China, the Middle East and Europe?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/103l512/what_do_historians_think_caused_the_acceleration/), submitted on 2023-01-05 09:09:02+08:00.
