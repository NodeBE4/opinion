I suspect it is probably Hong Kong Dollars, which would translate to US$5.25 at current exchange rates. Then again I usually see 'Oreo' simply rendered as 'Oreo' over here, so it could be Singapore Dollars in which case S$41=US$30.63 or so.

### 1021: [How did Imperial Russia first expand across, then maintain order and supplies to, its vast Siberian empire?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/101wuib/how_did_imperial_russia_first_expand_across_then/), submitted on 2023-01-03 11:29:40+08:00.

> Following the demise of the Silk Road, the steppe descending into generalized economic crisis and endemic warfare.

This is heavily questionable. There's a revisionist school of historians of Central Asia, most prominently Scott C. Levi, who have problematised our notions of the Silk Road, to the point of [arguing that it never existed at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jsb5my/whats_the_state_of_scholarship_on_the_silk_road/gbyl2uc/) in the form popularly imagined. In any event, the apparent secular decline of Central Asia in the 18th century that culminated in the slow collapse of the Bukharan Khanate was followed by the rise of Kokand and Khiva as powers in their own right with considerable regional influence.

Science communicators more than scientists as such. They did hold PhDs but the awarding of them was controversial to say the least, and the procedure extremely irregular. Youtuber BobbyBroccoli did [a two-part series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAB-wWbHL7VurPf2npHah-H8aHBYvd55e) on the Bogdanoffs' PhD controversy which is a good watch.

The puppets were made by the studio behind '80s British satirical show [Spitting Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_Image), which was well known for its grotesque caricatures of politicians and celebrities – both visual in the form of the puppets, and audial in the form of the impressionists doing the voices. In particular, Steve Nallon had a [terrifyingly on-point rendition of Margaret Thatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThkVqCYdR0Y) (though unfortunately he seems to be a bit of a milkshake duck these days and has associations with GB News, which is basically the UK's attempt at creating its own Fox News).

It’s more or less true of crypto too. Bitcoin peaked in 2017 and then slumped, and throughout 2018-19 it wasn’t uncommon to joke that it had become completely worthless. Then the speculator bubble of 2020 came, and then that finally popped, much to the delight of all of us over at r/Buttcoin. As Marx sort of said, events in history often happen twice: first as tragedy, then as farce.

### 1024: [What do Historians think caused the acceleration of certain technological advances (gunpowder, glass, massive infrastructure) in places like China, the Middle East and Europe?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/103l512/what_do_historians_think_caused_the_acceleration/), submitted on 2023-01-05 09:09:02+08:00.

> I’d recommend the book Guns, Germs and Steel

*Do not*. [There are few books that are *less* recommended than GGS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_jared_diamond.27s_.22guns.2C_germs.2C_and_steel.22)
