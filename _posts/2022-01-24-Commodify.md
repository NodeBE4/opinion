### 49: [Why did Belgium so stubbornly refuse to join the Anglo-French alliance in the runup to WWII?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/sblx52/why_did_belgium_so_stubbornly_refuse_to_join_the/), submitted on 2022-01-24 21:12:23+08:00.

Because they were smart. The French envisioned a war fought primarily on Belgian soil, to save Northern France from the horrors of the last war. The other option was to attack Germany, but the French believed technology had given war a defensive slant after the experiences of World War 1. Belgium knew that this defensive war would last years and lead to the total destruction of their country. They did everything they could before the war to preserve their neutrality, and when the war broke out surrendered quickly. In the process they saved themselves from immense suffering.

Yes thanks

### 50: [Has Russia effectively been acting as a military balancer between India and China?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/sbsqk3/has_russia_effectively_been_acting_as_a_military/), submitted on 2022-01-25 02:23:59+08:00.

No. At least not anymore. During the Cold War this was absolutely the case as China and the Soviet Union were direct military adversaries, complete with actual fighting along the border of two nuclear powers. Both tried to surround each other by supporting dissident states around them - China with Romania, Yugoslavia, and Albania and the Soviet Union with North Korea and Vietnam. After the Cold War, the main thing driving Russian arms sales was financial desperation. Though China and Russia did a detente, they still did not trust each other. Nevertheless, Russia - and this being in its "good" years with the West under Yeltsin - did a number of tech transfers to China to solve its cashflow problem.

The Indo-Russian and Vietnamese-Russian relationships are two sided and very sentimental, not a cynical scheme by Russia to undermine its main ally of convenience. India and Russia see each other as something like best friends, and Indian media is as critical of the United States as it is of China. Despite alignment of interests in recent years, the Indian-American relationship is poisoned by decades of American support for Pakistan and the perceived unreliability of the US as an ally owing to its abandonment of Afghanistan and the Kurds and the disrespect with which it treats its other partners. The former struck an especially deep chord because Indians saw Afghanistan as a key front in their proxy war with Pakistan. Russia, meanwhile, has a soft power advantage owing to decades of Soviet support for India. There's a general sentiment in India that while America has to be their main partner of convenience, Russia is their "real friend". The Russians are, of course, all too happy to turn this into arms deals since they need all the financial support they can get.

They don't like Russia, both because of support for India and because of the Soviet Afghan war which drove millions of refugees into Pakistan and involved direct clashes between the two.

### 51: [How does the severity of the situation in Ukraine today compare to 2014?](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/scn6m3/how_does_the_severity_of_the_situation_in_ukraine/), submitted on 2022-01-26 04:32:41+08:00.

----- __51.1__ -----2022-01-26 22:17:41+08:00:

The main difference is the scale. In 2014 it was clear Russia was just trying to break away separatist regions for leverage and keep Ukraine out of NATO. Now, with that strategy having failed and Russia building up unprecedented troop levels, any war will result in Russia either occupying half or the entirety of Ukraine.

### 52: [Why did the IJN and IJA hate each other so much?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/sdzwai/why_did_the_ijn_and_ija_hate_each_other_so_much/), submitted on 2022-01-27 22:40:23+08:00.

The other answers have done a good job explaining away historical myths and highlighting institutional factors. One thing that can't be overlooked on top of those is that the culture of the Japanese military in general was insubordinate, uncooperative, and acrimonious. *Gekokujo*, or loyal insubordination, had been a military tradition since the time of the Sengoku Jidai. Essentially mission command on steroids, the norm of gekokujo allowed Japanese officers to defy orders as long as they were acting aggressively. The widespread assumption of earlier historians was that gekokujo was only rewarded when insubordination led to successful results, but some officers even advanced their careers through *failed* gekokujo. After inciting the Khalkhin Gol incident, Col. Tsuji Masanobu was strangely put in charge of the IJA staff in Taipei, responsible for planning the 1941 invasion of Malaya.

The modern Japanese military was essentially a collection of gloryhounds from its conception. Insubordinate aggression offered the promise of rapid elevation and involved far fewer repercussions than it would in any other military. When authors mention IJA-IJN rivalry, they often don't elaborate on specifics. In the vast majority of cases, this rivalry involved the IJA and IJN trying to outdo each other and each steal the greater glory of an achievement, at the detriment of effective combination between both arms. They were, in effect, racing eachother to death or glory.

While the army-navy rivalry was certainly abetted by the civilian government, it, like Gekokujo in general, was willingly *enabled* by the powers that be. The Japanese firmly believed that only vigorous, unrestrained offensive spirit would enable victory on land or at sea, and were careful not to "institutionalize cowardice" by placing "undue restraints" on branches and their commanders. To this end, there was a separate army and navy ministry, a separate army and navy chief of staff, and *no* overall chief of staff. The reason this problem was allowed to go unabetted for such a long period of time was that the Japanese military establishment largely did not see it as a terrible problem, but simply as their longstanding way of operating and even as an advantage.
