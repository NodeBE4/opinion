### 49: [Why did Belgium so stubbornly refuse to join the Anglo-French alliance in the runup to WWII?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/sblx52/why_did_belgium_so_stubbornly_refuse_to_join_the/), submitted on 2022-01-24 21:12:23+08:00.

Because they were smart. The French envisioned a war fought primarily on Belgian soil, to save Northern France from the horrors of the last war. The other option was to attack Germany, but the French believed technology had given war a defensive slant after the experiences of World War 2. Belgium knew that this defensive war would last years and lead to the total destruction of their country. They did everything they could before the war to preserve their neutrality, and when the war broke out surrendered quickly. In the process they saved themselves from immense suffering.
