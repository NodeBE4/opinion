### 442: [It Turns Out Hillary Clinton, Not Russian Bots, Lost the 2016 Election](https://old.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/10cvuh9/it_turns_out_hillary_clinton_not_russian_bots/), submitted on 2023-01-16 05:41:28+08:00.

Hurr durr but muh Russian disinformation like hunter biden's laptop...

### 443: [My boyfriend and I are planning on traveling Europe sometime this year. Any tips?](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/10dlaj5/my_boyfriend_and_i_are_planning_on_traveling/), submitted on 2023-01-17 01:34:44+08:00.

----- __443.1__ -----2023-01-17 13:16:02+08:00:

Go to Spain.  Then, go to Portugal.  Money goes further there than anywhere else you'd want to go, except maybe Croatia.

> Stockholm, Amsterdam, anywhere in Germany/Switzerland

Both Stockholm and Amsterdam are very expensive.  Frankly, not worth the money in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, they are nice cities.  But not great places for vacationing. 

Germany is very nice in the summer.  Especially Munich.  Consider going to Vienna and/or Salzburg in Austria.  Very nice, great food, great alcohol and very friendly people with an endearingly colloquial form of German. 

Switzerland is my favorite country in Europe, but it is probably the second most expensive area you could have chosen (behind only Monaco).  Switzerland, in my opinion, is best in winter for sports.  

Italy is dirty and overpriced in most tourist-focused areas.  Get off the beaten path.  Consider going to Croatia instead.  Or better yet, just go to Spain.  And/or Portugal.

I agree with all of this.  Although there is no city in Europe with better nightlife than Barcelona.  

Spain is the most fun country I have been to outside of South America.

Bad dental hygiene.

### 445: [Hometown Grindr (Chicago)](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/10du769/hometown_grindr_chicago/), submitted on 2023-01-17 06:15:10+08:00.

----- __445.1__ -----2023-01-17 13:11:00+08:00:

To use a food analogy . . . Gibson's may be objectively better than In-N-Out.  But In-N-Out . . . in Chicago?  It's going to get attention. 

Another analogy.  Grindr is like going to the fridge.  You know what's in there but sometimes just look to confirm nothing new has found its way in.  Novelty is itself attractive.

### 446: [What’s your issue with the word “queer”?](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/10ei224/whats_your_issue_with_the_word_queer/), submitted on 2023-01-18 01:33:30+08:00.

----- __446.1__ -----2023-01-18 14:42:48+08:00:

Women (usually millennial, white and heterrosexual) describe themselves as "queer" to psychologically rationalize why they're in their mid-30s, single and have never held a stable relationship.  Having failed to improve their lives by changing their outfits, might as well try their professed "gender identity."  Doing this also has the additional benefit of putting the world on notice of why it revolves around such a person.

----- __446.2__ -----2023-01-18 14:45:35+08:00:

> I like specificity,

The word "queer" used in the context described by the OP means everything and nothing, at once.  Which is very much the point.  It's a way of adopting some kind of ostensibly disenfranchised identity, often as a pretext to find new and creative ways to be a Karen (read: insufferable bitch).

### 447: [Welcome to 2030. I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better](https://old.reddit.com/r/DarkFuturology/comments/10eugpx/welcome_to_2030_i_own_nothing_have_no_privacy_and/), submitted on 2023-01-18 09:46:29+08:00.

----- __447.1__ -----2023-01-18 13:51:52+08:00:

Славься, Отечество наше свободное, Дружбы народов надёжный оплот!  Партия Ленина - сила народная.  Нас к торжеству коммунизма ведёт!

Except not [ironically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs&ab_channel=rascrifice).

If only stupid ideas like this hadn't been tried before.
