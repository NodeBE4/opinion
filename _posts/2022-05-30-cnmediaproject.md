RT Nerys Avery<br>“The media briefing itself was run by the visiting government, the press passes were issued by the Chinese government,” she said. “They instructed us we would not be allowed to ask questions. When some of us yelled out questions anyway a Chinese official yelled out to stop.”

When China Computerworld announced in April that it would formally close up shop, the news marked the end of an era of commercial press development in China. CMP looks back on the magazine's role. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/31/paper-trails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/31/paper-trails/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUF5yYgagAApxAr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

1/6 Welcome to June. Last month, CMP wrote about politics on the front page of the People's Daily -- and how many absences from Xi in May would signal deep shifts underway at the top of the CCP. We suggested 5 pages as a cut off based on history: <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/19/politics-on-page-one%ef%bf%bc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/19/politics-on-page-one%ef%bf%bc/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUH8sHIacAAmBii?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 2/6 We looked at other signals for Xi and Li in the press, with talk Li's star was rising. The downplaying of Li's economy call with 100,000 cadres and up-playing of an Economic Daily editorial (for Xi) was odd. Here's how the PLA Daily handled it. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/26/curious-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/05/26/curious-signals/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIABJTakAExSdx?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3/6 But in the end for May we could count only 5 absences for Xi from People's Daily. That's border-line, but not a significant change to raise eyebrows. Red stars mark days with Xi or "general secretary." 3, 8, 17, 18, 23 were no-Xi days.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIAOaJaAAIxfjU?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 4/6 But Xi Jinping is starting the month of June very strong on the front page of the People's Daily. Back to the all-Xi-all-the-time show. No excitement, not even images, just . . . . Xi.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIBC0taMAE13aP?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 5/6 In fact, there is but ONE headline without Xi Jinping or "general secretary," about Wang Yang meeting with an Algerian official. And there is a piece too highlighting Xi's speech in the latest edition of Seeking Truth journal. Our related 2021 piece: <a href="https://bit.ly/3GAzWW2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3GAzWW2</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUICCziaUAA1oRV?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 6/6 And Li Keqiang? He appeared in one headline yesterday, about his meeting with Hong Kong’s next leader, John Lee. But on the first day of June 2022, Li's headline count = 0.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIDXvmacAA-qfr?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Interesting glimpse on page four today of the CCP's framing of lockdown policies today in the People's Daily. Beijing "resolutely" pushes on with "dynamic zero," the Shanghai people thankfully bid medical personnel farewell. . . And at bottom an ad for Seeking Truth journal. :)<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIFQNAakAA_zy-?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

New Licensing System for Online Dramas: From today online dramas in China will be issued formal distribution licenses like the coveted “Dragon Label” in front of box office films. The move, Chinese experts say, will ensure quality . . . and control. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/06/01/new-licensing-system-for-online-dramas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/06/01/new-licensing-system-for-online-dramas/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIiusJagAEcwkR?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
