### 935: [other than china and japan, did other east asian countries go into isolation, if so, why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z1eogy/other_than_china_and_japan_did_other_east_asian/), submitted on 2022-11-22 08:02:03+08:00.

No, because China and Japan did not go into isolation. In the case of Japan, 'isolationism' was used after the restoration to characterise Tokugawa policy as a way of discrediting the old regime, and, as /u/ParallelPain notes, [does not capture the finer points of Japan's engagement with the outside world](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iaxh4j/why_did_japan_decide_to_be_isolationist_during/). In the case of China, we ought not to conflate the policy of the Ming, which, per /u/_dk, imposed [strict but not total constraints on maritime trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2a9tgx/what_is_the_history_of_the_ming_dynastys_haijin/citfco1/?context=999), with the Qing, which, as an expansionist Eurasian empire, was *deeply* tied in with the global economy, as I cover [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c1we9g/why_was_the_treaty_port_system_operated_so/ergraoq/). Arguably the only 'isolationist' state was Korea, but even then the Koreans maintained trade relations within East Asia even if it didn't engage with the European powers. The notion that East Asian countries became these hermetically sealed entities has long been used both from within and without as a means of discrediting certain policies, but it is, on the whole, factually unsustainable.
