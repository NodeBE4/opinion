### 937: [[Tabletop gaming/Warhammer 40k] Leagues of Brokaan: how warhammer 40k’s newest army nearly ended up being the most obscenely broken army this edition has ever seen.](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z187cz/tabletop_gamingwarhammer_40k_leagues_of_brokaan/), submitted on 2022-11-22 03:45:36+08:00.

> Another fun result of the "No deploying within 1" of the enemy" rule was that getting out of transports was impossible if the enemy was near the egress points of the vehicle. You could surround a transport with infantry, then destroy the transport, watching the entire squad inside die instantly as you essentially leaned against the hatches.

I mean, there's a certain validity to that. Dismount your guys! Infantry were meant to fight on their legs, not in metal boxes!

### 938: [other than china and japan, did other east asian countries go into isolation, if so, why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z1eogy/other_than_china_and_japan_did_other_east_asian/), submitted on 2022-11-22 08:02:03+08:00.

----- __938.1__ -----2022-11-22 18:53:28+08:00:

No, because China and Japan did not go into isolation. In the case of Japan, 'isolationism' was used after the restoration to characterise Tokugawa policy as a way of discrediting the old regime, and, as /u/ParallelPain notes, [does not capture the finer points of Japan's engagement with the outside world](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iaxh4j/why_did_japan_decide_to_be_isolationist_during/). In the case of China, we ought not to conflate the policy of the Ming, which, per /u/_dk, imposed [strict but not total constraints on maritime trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2a9tgx/what_is_the_history_of_the_ming_dynastys_haijin/citfco1/?context=999), with the Qing, which, as an expansionist Eurasian empire, was *deeply* tied in with the global economy, as I cover [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c1we9g/why_was_the_treaty_port_system_operated_so/ergraoq/). Arguably the only 'isolationist' state was Korea, but even then the Koreans maintained trade relations within East Asia even if it didn't engage with the European powers. The notion that East Asian countries became these hermetically sealed entities has long been used both from within and without as a means of discrediting certain policies, but it is, on the whole, factually unsustainable.

### 939: [Spock violated Valeris' body, mind, and her rights](https://old.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/z1gtpu/spock_violated_valeris_body_mind_and_her_rights/), submitted on 2022-11-22 09:40:21+08:00.

Three cheers for Gene's Vision, everyone!

### 940: [Petition to change the “Cavalry” unit to the Dragoon unit](https://old.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/z2t29u/petition_to_change_the_cavalry_unit_to_the/), submitted on 2022-11-24 00:10:08+08:00.

----- __940.1__ -----2022-11-24 09:15:27+08:00:

Yes and no. Dragoons as originally conceived in the 17th century were mounted infantry, but dragoons and other ordinary 'horse' basically met in the middle by the early 18th century, largely fighting in close quarters in battle but retaining the ability to skirmish with firearms.

### 941: [In the Klingon lexicon, the term for "pair" is "chang`eng".](https://old.reddit.com/r/tlhInganHol/comments/z2zqij/in_the_klingon_lexicon_the_term_for_pair_is/), submitted on 2022-11-24 04:33:19+08:00.

----- __941.1__ -----2022-11-24 09:21:19+08:00:

It's a classic joke among linguists, orthographers and the like that 'ghoti' is a legitimate spelling of 'fish', as long as you pronounce:

* 'gh' like in 'cough' where it makes an 'f' sound,
* 'o' like in 'women' where it makes an 'i' sound, and
* 'ti' like in 'initial' where it makes a 'sh' sound.

Mark Okrand, creator of Klingon, thus decided 'ghotI'' would be Klingon for 'fish'.
