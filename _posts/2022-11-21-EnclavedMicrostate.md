### 937: [[Tabletop gaming/Warhammer 40k] Leagues of Brokaan: how warhammer 40k’s newest army nearly ended up being the most obscenely broken army this edition has ever seen.](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z187cz/tabletop_gamingwarhammer_40k_leagues_of_brokaan/), submitted on 2022-11-22 03:45:36+08:00.

> Another fun result of the "No deploying within 1" of the enemy" rule was that getting out of transports was impossible if the enemy was near the egress points of the vehicle. You could surround a transport with infantry, then destroy the transport, watching the entire squad inside die instantly as you essentially leaned against the hatches.

I mean, there's a certain validity to that. Dismount your guys! Infantry were meant to fight on their legs, not in metal boxes!

### 938: [other than china and japan, did other east asian countries go into isolation, if so, why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z1eogy/other_than_china_and_japan_did_other_east_asian/), submitted on 2022-11-22 08:02:03+08:00.

----- __938.1__ -----2022-11-22 18:53:28+08:00:

No, because China and Japan did not go into isolation. In the case of Japan, 'isolationism' was used after the restoration to characterise Tokugawa policy as a way of discrediting the old regime, and, as /u/ParallelPain notes, [does not capture the finer points of Japan's engagement with the outside world](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iaxh4j/why_did_japan_decide_to_be_isolationist_during/). In the case of China, we ought not to conflate the policy of the Ming, which, per /u/_dk, imposed [strict but not total constraints on maritime trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2a9tgx/what_is_the_history_of_the_ming_dynastys_haijin/citfco1/?context=999), with the Qing, which, as an expansionist Eurasian empire, was *deeply* tied in with the global economy, as I cover [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c1we9g/why_was_the_treaty_port_system_operated_so/ergraoq/). Arguably the only 'isolationist' state was Korea, but even then the Koreans maintained trade relations within East Asia even if it didn't engage with the European powers. The notion that East Asian countries became these hermetically sealed entities has long been used both from within and without as a means of discrediting certain policies, but it is, on the whole, factually unsustainable.

### 939: [Spock violated Valeris' body, mind, and her rights](https://old.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/z1gtpu/spock_violated_valeris_body_mind_and_her_rights/), submitted on 2022-11-22 09:40:21+08:00.

Three cheers for Gene's Vision, everyone!

### 940: [Petition to change the “Cavalry” unit to the Dragoon unit](https://old.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/z2t29u/petition_to_change_the_cavalry_unit_to_the/), submitted on 2022-11-24 00:10:08+08:00.

----- __940.1__ -----2022-11-24 09:15:27+08:00:

Yes and no. Dragoons as originally conceived in the 17th century were mounted infantry, but dragoons and other ordinary 'horse' basically met in the middle by the early 18th century, largely fighting in close quarters in battle but retaining the ability to skirmish with firearms.

### 941: [In the Klingon lexicon, the term for "pair" is "chang`eng".](https://old.reddit.com/r/tlhInganHol/comments/z2zqij/in_the_klingon_lexicon_the_term_for_pair_is/), submitted on 2022-11-24 04:33:19+08:00.

----- __941.1__ -----2022-11-24 09:21:19+08:00:

It's a classic joke among linguists, orthographers and the like that 'ghoti' is a legitimate spelling of 'fish', as long as you pronounce:

* 'gh' like in 'cough' where it makes a 'f' sound,
* 'o' like in 'women' where it makes an 'i' sound, and
* 'ti' like in 'initial' where it makes a 'sh' sound.

Mark Okrand, creator of Klingon, thus decided 'ghotI'' would be Klingon for 'fish'.

### 942: [What did the Byzantines call China?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z3sr4t/what_did_the_byzantines_call_china/), submitted on 2022-11-25 03:40:04+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).
