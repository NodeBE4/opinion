HK activists' free speech are threatened by pro-CCP nationalists, such as CSSAs, which are CCP's extended arms. The hosts of my talks at NUY, JHU, and UPenn received similar disinviting letters and protests. CSSAs should register as foreign agents as they are part of CCP's organs<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2K9_pZXMAUQZju?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re This is what happened with my talk at UChicacgo. The letter the CSSA of UChicago sent to the school demonstrates their intention to disallow views in support of HK protests to be expressed. Similar incidents have been repeated so many times. We should act.<br><br>Nathan Law 羅冠聰: 1. Last week I was invited to attend a guest series at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. By then, I did not realize that the UC Chinese Students and Scholars Association(CSSA) protested the invitation and accuse me of “hurting” their feelings with all the disinformation.<br><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2A3uyNXEAMw8Cm?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

G7 should work together and hold China accountable. It's nothing to do with racism -- it's to protect individuals in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Stop using "anti-racism" as protection to dictators. Genocide deniers are not our allies. <br>#StandwithHongKong<br><br>Secretary Antony Blinken: The Chinese government continues to dismantle the democratic institutions of Hong Kong, including the Legislative Council. We stand with the people of Hong Kong, whose will the People's Republic of China is attempting to subvert. #StandWithHongKong<br>
