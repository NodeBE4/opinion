   Yesterday Twitter released very disappointing quarterly results, with misses on both user and revenue growth. From the
   <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-revenue-rises-74-1430250091">
    Wall Street Journal
   </a>
   :
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Twitter Inc. delivered its weakest quarterly revenue growth as a publicly traded company, casting a shadow on its fledgling advertising business, which until now has been a consistent bright spot. Investors, who sent the company’s stock down nearly 20%, were hit with a double whammy Tuesday as Twitter’s first-quarter results were leaked on the social-media service itself an hour before their release was expected.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The symbolism of the leak was appropriate: Twitter the service is so clearly indispensable, at least for some, but Twitter the company can’t seem to get it right.

   And so, after five years in charge, I believe it’s time for Twitter’s leadership, in particular CEO Dick Costolo, to make way for new leadership that has improved credibility with Wall Street, with developers, and within Twitter itself.

    Note: At the bottom of the article I have included a number of links to previous articles and Daily Updates where I developed many of the individual pieces of this argument; in other words, this is not a knee-jerk reaction to one bad earnings report, but rather a culmination of years of concern

  <h4>
   Twitter’s Fundamental Problem
  </h4>
  <p>
   Twitter’s fundamental problem is that their active user growth is simply too small given their current size. Twitter yesterday reported the service had 302 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs), an increase of only 18% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter (and the company said the current quarter would be worse!). This is a fraction of Facebook,
   <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-dominates-online-communication-2015-4/#.VUCh9s7OFTY">
    half of Facebook Messenger
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/12/10/instagram-leaves-twitter-in-the-dust-with-300-million-active-users/">
    fewer than Instagram
   </a>
   and
   <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchats-monthly-active-users-may-be-nearing-200-million-2014-12">
    not that much bigger than SnapChat
   </a>
   ; presuming the latter service passes Twitter later this year, Twitter will be only the 5th most popular U.S.-based social networking service looking to monetize through advertising. This distinction — which excludes WhatsApp, at least for now — is a critical one, because the issue with advertisers is most don’t have the time or ability to work with multiple services; it’s likely most digital advertising spending (which I
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2015/old-fashioned-snapchat/">
    believe is set to expand greatly
   </a>
   ) will be consolidated onto the biggest networks (along with Google’s properties), with
   <a href="http://stratechery.com/2015/facebook-and-the-feed/">
    Facebook taking the lion’s share
   </a>
   . Were that to happen, it’s easy to see Twitter as the odd network out.
   <a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" href="#footnote_1_1558" id="identifier_1_1558" title="Moreover, Twitter’s MAU numbers are not necessarily what they seem, particularly from an advertising perspective. The company disclosed last year that 14% of its MAUs never visit Twitter’s website or apps; rather,  these users have connected 3rd-party applications and websites that don’t display Twitter ads; for example, you can log into Twitter from Instagram in order to post a link to a photo. Moreover, that number doubled over the previous year, a stark contrast to Facebook’s &lt;5% figure. Worse, a sizable portion of those users may be lapsed completely; according to Twitter approximately 8.5% of MAUs are due to applications that automatically ping Twitter without any user involvement.
One example of such an application was iOS 7 Safari: in Twitter’s 2014 4Q results the company blamed its slowing user growth numbers on iOS 8, which ended Safari’s practice of pinging Twitter for its Shared Links whether or not the logged-in user ever read that section. The proper interpretation, though, was not that Twitter’s user growth numbers were accidentally and temporarily slowed, but rather that the company had been over-counting MAUs for at least a year. Add in the fact that, according to Twitter, up to 5% of MAUs are likely spam accounts, and it’s fair to wonder just how many people are actually being served ads from Twitter’s advertisers">

  <h4>
   Worrying Signs from Advertisers
  </h4>
  <p>
   Twitter’s recent results suggest this shakeout may already be happening. CFO Anthony Noto was asked repeatedly on the
   <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3113736-twitters-twtr-ceo-dick-costolo-on-q1-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript">
    earning’s conference call
   </a>
   about Twitter’s success in retaining advertisers, and Noto repeatedly refused to answer the question, instead stating that “year-over-year growth [in total advertisers] was very similar to what it was in the fourth quarter.” The problem, though, is that later in the call Noto noted that Twitter’s advertising load factor was flat: if Twitter was adding advertisers, but not ads, that strongly suggests that the company is in fact
   <em>
    losing
   </em>
   advertisers just as quickly as it is adding them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Noto’s other justifications for Twitter’s revenue miss weren’t very compelling, either:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The first was that “some advertisers limited spending at higher levels of scale because the bids required to win incremental auctions were higher than they were willing to pay, which limited additional spending.” In other words, larger advertisers had in mind a price they were willing to pay, and preferred to reach fewer users rather than pay a higher price, suggesting that advertisers saw limited value in Twitter’s ads
