Re "If XJP can find a way out of the zero-Covid quagmire, people might go back to their algorithmically streamlined lives and forget about their current frustrations. If not, then you’ll probably see the hard edge of surveillance being used more and more, and generating resistance."<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fix_I-8aMAI4O8U?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Colorless Tributes for Jiang Zemin: A quick look at how CCP media and more commercially oriented sites treated the news this afternoon of the death of the former leader. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/11/30/dark-tributes-for-jiang-zemin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/11/30/dark-tributes-for-jiang-zemin/</a>

This piece from the CMP archives (2017), originally published through SupChina, looks at the political rituals and language surrounding the death of "esteemed," "great" and "outstanding" Party comrades.

The Xinhua release this afternoon on Jiang's death refers to him as a "great proletarian revolutionary." The "great" here is a subtle distinction, but an important one — an honor bestowed on few.<br><br>China Media Project: This piece from the CMP archives (2017), originally published through SupChina, looks at the political rituals and language surrounding the death of "esteemed," "great" and "outstanding" Party comrades.

In this newly relevant piece from the CMP archives, David Bandurski looks at the politics surrounding the death of CCP officials, and some of the fixtures of related discourse. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/11/30/the-politics-of-passing-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/11/30/the-politics-of-passing-on/</a>

Official announcements about Jiang Zemin's death may seem like heaps of nonsense. But take a closer look at newspaper layouts today and they tell us clearly where the Chinese Communist Party would like us to focus — on the defining of legacies. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/12/01/looking-the-peoples-daily-in-the-eye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/12/01/looking-the-peoples-daily-in-the-eye/</a>

David Bandurski looks at the messaging conveyed today through the rigidly identical black-and-white front pages of CCP-run newspapers in China, paying tribute to deceased former general secretary Jiang Zemin. Hint: look at the "newspaper eye" (报眼). <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/12/01/looking-the-peoples-daily-in-the-eye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/12/01/looking-the-peoples-daily-in-the-eye/</a>

Re The key language used to define Jiang's legacy is included in the second paragraph of the official Xinhua announcement run yesterday, and on the front page today. It is pulled out and placed in the "newspaper eye," the space to the right of the masthead.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fi5C3nSaUAEziZO?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re "Comrade Jiang Zemin was an outstanding leader who had the utmost respect of our Party, our military, and the various peoples of our nation; a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, politician, military expert, and diplomat . . . " It's in other CCP papers too.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fi5DSvfacAMnhjT?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Is it unusual in its effusiveness? No, not at all. In fact, it almost perfectly mirrors the language used for Deng Xiaoping following his death on February 19, 1997. Just look at the two front pages side by side. Almost identical, even the headlines and "newspaper eye" (报眼).<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fi5Dld-aEAI8x1p?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The phrase “an outstanding leader who had the utmost respect of our Party, our military, and the various peoples of our nation” (我党我军我国各族人民公认的享有崇高威望的卓越领导人) — used for Jiang yesterday and today — originated with Deng's death.
