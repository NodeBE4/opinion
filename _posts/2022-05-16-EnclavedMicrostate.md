### 434: [I have heard many times how Indians say that Alexander was defeated when he tried to attack india. What’s the basis of the claim ?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uqplag/i_have_heard_many_times_how_indians_say_that/), submitted on 2022-05-16 14:40:29+08:00.

More can of course be said, particularly regarding the march in Gedrosia, but I discuss what the sources say on Alexander's closing of the Indian campaign [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qzlynj/what_scared_alexanders_soldiers_when_they_reached/hlr5foz/?context=999). Put simply, half of our source tradition on Alexander runs the gamut from cynical to openly hostile, and if Alexander had somehow lost the Battle of the Hydaspes against Poros – or somehow Chandragupta, who was not even king of anything at the time – then we would expect at least *one* of the surviving accounts to have said it.
