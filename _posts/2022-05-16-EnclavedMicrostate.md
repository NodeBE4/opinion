### 434: [I have heard many times how Indians say that Alexander was defeated when he tried to attack india. What’s the basis of the claim ?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uqplag/i_have_heard_many_times_how_indians_say_that/), submitted on 2022-05-16 14:40:29+08:00.

More can of course be said, particularly regarding the march in Gedrosia, but I discuss what the sources say on Alexander's closing of the Indian campaign [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qzlynj/what_scared_alexanders_soldiers_when_they_reached/hlr5foz/?context=999). Put simply, half of our source tradition on Alexander runs the gamut from cynical to openly hostile, and if Alexander had somehow lost the Battle of the Hydaspes against Poros – or somehow Chandragupta, who was not even king of anything at the time – then we would expect at least *one* of the surviving accounts to have said it.

### 435: [Why do some Chinese claim Korea to be part of China? Was Korea ever a part of China? Were they effectively under Chinese rule when they were a vassal state of China?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uqvht2/why_do_some_chinese_claim_korea_to_be_part_of/), submitted on 2022-05-16 21:03:56+08:00.

> Also through long periods of Korean history, Korea was a vassal state of China. This only ended with the farcical proclamation of Korea as an "empire" in 1897. Basically what happened is that Japan twisted Korea's arm into declaring itself an empire as that declaration would make it (officially) the equal to China and thus cut off Korea's traditional vassalage to China. This is all mostly a bad joke as it was just another step on the road towards Japanese annexation of Korea.

I'd be interested to hear where you get this from, as my understanding, coming mainly from Kirk Larsen and Andre Schmid, is that Korea in 1897 was effectively a Russian protectorate following the Triple Intervention, and that its declaration of imperial status was A: voluntary and deliberate on the part of the King Gojong and B: an assertion of status against both Japan and the Qing, and not simply an anti-Qing move.
