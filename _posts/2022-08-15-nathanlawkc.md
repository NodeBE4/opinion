1. It's been a few months since I published "Freedom." There's been positive news for the book, including getting 2021 Foreword INDIES Gold Winner. I want to talk about why I wanted to write this introductory book for the HK protest movement and the moving reviews.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaM9GXeX0AA-KHR?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. Hong Kong was meant to be a safe haven and refuge. Generations of Chinese escaped the economic disasters and political terror in last century and found peace and prosperity in this city. Sadly, it turns to a persecutor now — this is a fascinating historical irony.

Re 5. Most of us who repel and resist are not innately anti-CCP. I grew up cheering for the achievement of China and its great Olympic campaign in 2008. It was how they stripped away our freedoms, and the brutalities to its people that propelled us to do so. To dissent is a reaction

Re 7. Stories are the best medium to carry an idea or a concept. I wrote it to demonstrate the fragility of freedom and the importance of democracy through the lens of my life. It's a light-hearted and informative book for readers without prior knowledge of HK issues.
