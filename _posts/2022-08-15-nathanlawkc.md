1. It's been a few months since I published "Freedom." There's been positive news for the book, including getting 2021 Foreword INDIES Gold Winner. I want to talk about why I wanted to write this introductory book for the HK protest movement and the moving reviews.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaM9GXeX0AA-KHR?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. Hong Kong was meant to be a safe haven and refuge. Generations of Chinese escaped the economic disasters and political terror in last century and found peace and prosperity in this city. Sadly, it turns to a persecutor now — this is a fascinating historical irony.

Re 6. My years of activism in the center of HK politics demonstrated how it had changed drastically over the past few years. My role turned from a student activist, lawmaker, political prisoner, and exiled activist. Room for political participation and diversity shrank.

Re 7. Stories are the best medium to carry an idea or a concept. I wrote it to demonstrate the fragility of freedom and the importance of democracy through the lens of my life. It's a light-hearted and informative book for readers without prior knowledge of HK issues.

Non-jury trial is set for one of the most most iconic National Security Law cases. Rule of law is violated, and these defendants are charged because of running in a primary election —what an absurd development. My blessing is with all the defendants, including @joshuawongcf.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaSrdssXoAA_Sa7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
