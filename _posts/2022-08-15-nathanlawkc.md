Re 2. It starts with the story of my father. In his late twenties, there was no food in his peasant village and going to HK was the only hope for survival. He smuggled to HK through a dangerous raft ride for three days, and gained citizenship in HK through govt policy.

Re 3. Hong Kong was meant to be a safe haven and refuge. Generations of Chinese escaped the economic disasters and political terror in last century and found peace and prosperity in this city. Sadly, it turns to a persecutor now — this is a fascinating historical irony.

Re 6. My years of activism in the center of HK politics demonstrated how it had changed drastically over the past few years. My role turned from a student activist, lawmaker, political prisoner, and exiled activist. Room for political participation and diversity shrank.

Re 7. Stories are the best medium to carry an idea or a concept. I wrote it to demonstrate the fragility of freedom and the importance of democracy through the lens of my life. It's a light-hearted and informative book for readers without prior knowledge of HK issues.

Non-jury trial is set for one of the most most iconic National Security Law cases. Rule of law is violated, and these defendants are charged because of running in a primary election —what an absurd development. My blessing is with all the defendants, including @joshuawongcf.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaSrdssXoAA_Sa7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
