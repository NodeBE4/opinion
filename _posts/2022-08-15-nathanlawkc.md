1. It's been a few months since I published "Freedom." There's been positive news for the book, including getting 2021 Foreword INDIES Gold Winner. I want to talk about why I wanted to write this introductory book for the HK protest movement and the moving reviews.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaM9GXeX0AA-KHR?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 4. Then I talked about my growing up in a blue-collar, apolitical family. I studied in schools operated by pro-Beijing institutes. I had been indifferent to social affairs until I learned the story of Liu Xiao Bo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and the Tiananmen massacre.

Re 5. Most of us who repel and resist are not innately anti-CCP. I grew up cheering for the achievement of China and its great Olympic campaign in 2008. It was how they stripped away our freedoms, and the brutalities to its people that propelled us to do so. To dissent is a reaction

Re 8. This book is more than myself -- it carries a mission to spread HK people's brave fight against the dictator Xi. I hope it can be read by more and garner more support for our democratic movement. It's the vocation that I committed to throughout my life.

Non-jury trial is set for one of the most most iconic National Security Law cases. Rule of law is violated, and these defendants are charged because of running in a primary election —what an absurd development. My blessing is with all the defendants, including @joshuawongcf.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaSrdssXoAA_Sa7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
