1. It's been a few months since I published "Freedom." There's been positive news for the book, including getting 2021 Foreword INDIES Gold Winner. I want to talk about why I wanted to write this introductory book for the HK protest movement and the moving reviews.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaM9GXeX0AA-KHR?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 4. Then I talked about my growing up in a blue-collar, apolitical family. I studied in schools operated by pro-Beijing institutes. I had been indifferent to social affairs until I learned the story of Liu Xiao Bo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and the Tiananmen massacre.

Re 6. My years of activism in the center of HK politics demonstrated how it had changed drastically over the past few years. My role turned from a student activist, lawmaker, political prisoner, and exiled activist. Room for political participation and diversity shrank.

Re 7. Stories are the best medium to carry an idea or a concept. I wrote it to demonstrate the fragility of freedom and the importance of democracy through the lens of my life. It's a light-hearted and informative book for readers without prior knowledge of HK issues.

Non-jury trial is set for one of the most most iconic National Security Law cases. Rule of law is violated, and these defendants are charged because of running in a primary election —what an absurd development. My blessing is with all the defendants, including @joshuawongcf.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaSrdssXoAA_Sa7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
