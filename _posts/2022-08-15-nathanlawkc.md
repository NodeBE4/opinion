Re 2. It starts with the story of my father. In his late twenties, there was no food in his peasant village and going to HK was the only hope for survival. He smuggled to HK through a dangerous raft ride for three days, and gained citizenship in HK through govt policy.

Re 4. Then I talked about my growing up in a blue-collar, apolitical family. I studied in schools operated by pro-Beijing institutes. I had been indifferent to social affairs until I learned the story of Liu Xiao Bo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and the Tiananmen massacre.

Re 5. Most of us who repel and resist are not innately anti-CCP. I grew up cheering for the achievement of China and its great Olympic campaign in 2008. It was how they stripped away our freedoms, and the brutalities to its people that propelled us to do so. To dissent is a reaction

Re 7. Stories are the best medium to carry an idea or a concept. I wrote it to demonstrate the fragility of freedom and the importance of democracy through the lens of my life. It's a light-hearted and informative book for readers without prior knowledge of HK issues.

Non-jury trial is set for one of the most most iconic National Security Law cases. Rule of law is violated, and these defendants are charged because of running in a primary election —what an absurd development. My blessing is with all the defendants, including @joshuawongcf.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaSrdssXoAA_Sa7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
