### 913: [Voter fraud in action: The Nazi Party is projected to get 192 million votes from 55.4 million voters, while the big-tent party of five Interest Groups gets none at all.](https://old.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/ynvirn/voter_fraud_in_action_the_nazi_party_is_projected/), submitted on 2022-11-07 00:51:28+08:00.

Rule 5: The combined total of votes across all interest groups is something like 4x my voting population, but also the only party that will actually get these votes is the Nazis led by the Armed Forces. So that's... interesting.

----- __913.2__ -----2022-11-07 02:17:34+08:00:

I believe that that's the Radical Party symbol. As for your second question, parties cause all Interest Groups within them to be counted as one, so you don't get the legitimacy penalty that comes with having more than one group in government.

----- __913.3__ -----2022-11-07 03:16:05+08:00:

Even so, the Nazis should not get *all* the votes.

----- __913.4__ -----2022-11-07 03:26:58+08:00:

They join these parties if they have common ideological stances, either inherently or because of their leaders. So in this case, all five of the Interest Groups shown were either inherently or temporarily Radical, and were thus willing to join under that banner. If you unlock the option to have an Anarchist party, the Trade Unions might split off to form that, for instance.

----- __913.5__ -----2022-11-07 04:58:37+08:00:

Universal Suffrage.

----- __913.6__ -----2022-11-07 05:37:16+08:00:

Okay cool, so what about the other part which is the part where the Nazis get 100% of the vote?

### 914: [Is it true there were dead bodies of workers/soldiers within the Great Wall of China during construction?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ypt90a/is_it_true_there_were_dead_bodies_of/), submitted on 2022-11-09 01:44:53+08:00.

The notion that the Great Wall contains human bodies is an interesting one, and goes in some unexpected directions.

First, because it bears mentioning, when we use the phrase 'Great Wall' we are potentially referring to two separate concepts. The first is the rather clumsy colloquial use of the term to describe *every* frontier wall built by a Sinitic state (plus also the Mongolic Khitan Liao and the Tungusic Jurchen Jin), much though not all of which are now eroded beyond recognition; the second is specifically the largely-extant wall built in stages by the Ming between about 1470 and 1570. The issue is that there is a tendency to compress all of these into a single entity, but as I go into in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wb8na3/when_it_comes_to_the_great_wall_of_china_what_is/), even if we do use the phrase 'Great Wall' we need to understand that there have been *many* 'Great Walls', both geographically and chronologically discontinuous. So, in turn, there was not simply *a* construction of the Great Wall, because there have been *many* constructions, and the tale about human remains refers to the Qin walls of the late 3rd century BCE, and *not* the extant Ming walls of the 15th and 16th centuries CE.

Under the Han, the walls built by the Qin were portrayed as symbolic of the tyrannical impulses of Qin Shi Huang and his exercise of Legalist philosophy, which in its political form advocated for absolutism and the ultimate power of the state, embodied in the person of the emperor. Per Arthur Waldron, this found its way into two parallel discursive traditions, one elite and one popular, around the construction of the Qin frontier walls. The elite tradition centred on the imperial court, where, according to the Han court historian Sima Qian, Qin Shi Huang's right-hand man, Meng Tian, was made to commit suicide after the emperor's death in 210 directly due to the wall construction. In the brief monologue Sima Qian has Meng Tian deliver before taking the fatal poison, he states that in building ramparts from Lintao to Liaodong, he must have cut across the veins of the earth, this being his capital crime. Sima Qian himself, however, regarded Meng Tian's principal crime as his repeated conscription of labour and callous disregard for public welfare, but even then that was intimately tied with the massive mobilisation of labour towards wall construction.

The popular vein focussed on how wall-building affected the local populace on a much more intimate level. Folk songs around the Qin walls became commonplace, with one song warning parents to abandon sons at birth as they would only end up suffering and dying as conscripted labour at the foot of the wall, and to celebrate the birth of daughters instead. This verse would be incorporated into a number of later ballads by elite writers. But it is important to note that the bodies lay *outside* the wall, not *in* it, in this telling.

The story of bodies being *in* the wall relates to the legend of Lady Meng Jiang, a pretty famous tale in Chinese folklore, and one with a complex history. Its earliest form comes in a 4rd century BCE text, the *Zuo zhuan* (or *Commentary of Zuo*), which, yes, *predates* the Qin-era wall constructions. It is also incredibly brief, and consists solely of the statement that the anonymous widow of Qi Liang insisted that ritual propriety be observed by the state that had sent him to war. The connection with a wall – of any sort – was added by the Han scholar Liu Xiang ca. 18 BCE in the *Lienü zhuan* (*Biographies of Exemplary Women*), who states that she wept over her husband's corpse at the foot of the city wall, which collapsed ten days later. Note that this was merely the wall of her city, not a frontier wall. Folk narratives around bodies being buried in frontier walls emerged during the Northern and Southern period (typically defined as 420-589 CE but some have stretched the term back to begin with the Three Kingdoms period starting in 220), when fortification was especially prolific and mortality was high. Only during the Tang period (618-907) do we see the older legend of Lady Meng Jiang (who also only began going by this name around this time) merge with much later motifs of mortality in building frontier walls, to produce the modern folk tale in which it was the Qin wall specifically that actually contained human bodies.

As an aside, it is worth stressing, as u/itsallfolklore is wont to do, that the notion that folklore must contain a grain of truth is itself folklore. When I (well, technically Arthur Waldron as summarised by me) say that stories circulated about bodies buried in frontier walls, that does not mean that there were bodies, only that there were stories. We cannot definitively disprove that there may have been, but even if so the folk tales would be correct only by coincidence.

The chronological compression of Great Walls is not a novel development, and indeed even the Ming walls, soon after they were built, found parts of the Meng Jiang myth projected on them. In the late 15th century, the fortifications at Shanhaiguan were alleged to have originally been built by the Qin and restored by the Ming (they were not; the Qin frontier was further north), and to have been where Meng Jiang found her husband, and one of the towers was dubbed the 'husband-watching-tower' as being the place from which she tried to spot him in the crowd. A shrine to Meng Jiang would be established (or possibly re-established) in the area in 1594, tying the Tang myth around the Qin wall into the Ming wall of the then-present.

For further reading, the definitive treatment of the Great Wall in English remains Arthur Waldron's *The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth* (1989).
