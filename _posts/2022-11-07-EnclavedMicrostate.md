### 911: [Voter fraud in action: The Nazi Party is projected to get 192 million votes from 55.4 million voters, while the big-tent party of five Interest Groups gets none at all.](https://old.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/ynvirn/voter_fraud_in_action_the_nazi_party_is_projected/), submitted on 2022-11-07 00:51:28+08:00.

Rule 5: The combined total of votes across all interest groups is something like 4x my voting population, but also the only party that will actually get these votes is the Nazis led by the Armed Forces. So that's... interesting.

I believe that that's the Radical Party symbol. As for your second question, parties cause all Interest Groups within them to be counted as one, so you don't get the legitimacy penalty that comes with having more than one group in government.
