### 590: [Contrived Conspiracy Conjecture - Weekly Discussion Thread, July 4th, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/vr9ex4/contrived_conspiracy_conjecture_weekly_discussion/), submitted on 2022-07-04 23:03:57+08:00.

As someone who speaks Cantonese natively and has intermediate Mandarin listening... this was joyous and painful in equal measure.

----- __590.2__ -----2022-07-06 02:49:44+08:00:

Well, those are their primary Sinitic languages, but from the stream it's clear that Selen has at least intermediate Mandarin and Enna a similar but possibly lesser level of Cantonese.

### 591: [How long have people been using "say cheese" to get people to smile in pictures?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vrpbh7/how_long_have_people_been_using_say_cheese_to_get/), submitted on 2022-07-05 12:14:31+08:00.

### 592: [Have there been any illegal CIA operations on U.S. soil? Is it reasonable to believe CIA still involves itself in domestic affairs today?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vrpmz1/have_there_been_any_illegal_cia_operations_on_us/), submitted on 2022-07-05 12:34:17+08:00.

### 594: [Did the Southern Chinese emigrate out of the country abroad before the rest of the country?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vs58z8/did_the_southern_chinese_emigrate_out_of_the/), submitted on 2022-07-06 02:56:33+08:00.

----- __594.1__ -----2022-07-06 13:55:39+08:00:

More can of course be said, but I discuss a lot of the factors in early Sino-American migration in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k6efdb/what_was_happening_in_china_in_the_1850s_that/gesinbd/). It's broadly true that the Chinese diaspora was, until comparatively recently, originally dominated by people from southern regions, and for some pretty obvious reasons – it's where all the ports are!

### 595: [[Wikipedia] When a user managed to write over 206 articles of fake Russian history in Chinese Wikipedia in the span of a decade.](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/vs8138/wikipedia_when_a_user_managed_to_write_over_206/), submitted on 2022-07-06 04:57:55+08:00.

----- __595.1__ -----2022-07-06 10:48:47+08:00:

So, interesting as this is, I can't help but remark that some of it, by which I mean almost the entire thing bar a couple of added notes, seems to be cribbed from [this article on Sixth Tone](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010653/she-spent-a-decade-writing-fake-russian-history.-wikipedia-just-noticed.), an English-language news site on Chinese current affairs and human interest news. 

For instance, the post has:

> She began her career in false history in 2010, creating articles with fictional stories related to the real figure of Heshen, an infamously corrupt Qing Dynasty official. She turned her attention to Russian history in 2012, editing existing articles on Czar Alexander I of Russia. From then on, she spread fabricated stories throughout Chinese Wikipedia’s coverage of Russian history. She used a real, and often bloody, rivalry between the two early Slavic states as a basis for an elaborate fiction, mixing research with fantasy.

While the article has

> She began her career in fictional history in 2010, creating articles with false stories related to the real figure of Heshen, a famously corrupt Qing Dynasty official. She turned her attention to Russian history in 2012, editing existing articles on Czar Alexander I of Russia. From there, she gradually spread fabricated stories throughout Chinese Wikipedia’s coverage of Russian history. She used a real, and often bloody, rivalry between the two early Slavic states as a basis for an elaborate fiction, mixing research with fantasy.

Or compare this in the post:

> Wikipedia editors warned that the incident had “shaken the credibility of the current Chinese Wikipedia as a whole,” strangely enough, most netizens encouraged and idolized the user for her actions, citing her creativity and her unusually detailed descriptions of the different aspects of the society and culture of her pseudo-historical fictional world.

> “It is really awesome to invent a self-contained historical logic with details like all kinds of clothing, money, and utensils,” one user wrote on Weibo, a Chinese social media app.

> As of June 17, most of the fictitious historical entries created by Zhemao on Chinese Wikipedia have been deleted, according to an official statement. A few articles of actual historical subjects have been improved by other contributors and thus remain. Zhemao’s edits on other existing entries have been withdrawn, the platform wrote.

With this in the article:

> While some Wikipedia editors warned that the incident had “shaken the credibility of the current Chinese Wikipedia as a whole,” most netizens praised Zhemao’s talent and persistence, encouraging her to publish a novel in future.

> “It is really awesome to invent a self-contained historical logic with details like all kinds of clothing, money, and utensils,” one user wrote on the microblogging platform Weibo.

> As of June 17, most of the fictitious historical entries created by Zhemao on Chinese Wikipedia have been deleted, according to an official statement. A few entries have been improved by other contributors and thus remain. Zhemao’s edits on other existing entries have been withdrawn, the platform wrote.

Or this in the post:

> Yifan (or Yi Fan), a fantasy novelist, was reading Chinese Wikipedia with the goal of finding inspiration in historical matters, when he first learned of the great silver mine of Kashin. Originally opened by the principality of Tver, an independent state from the 13th to 15th centuries, it grew to be one of the world’s biggest, a city-sized early modern industry worked by some 30,000 slaves and 10,000 freedmen. Its rich economy made it an important resource to the princes of Tver, but also attracted the powerful rulers of Muscovy (Moscow), who attempted to take the mine in a series of battles that took turn across the land of what is now Russia from 1305 to 1485. “After the fall of the Principality of Tver, it continued to be mined by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and its successor regime until the mine was closed in the mid-18th century due to being exhausted,” the entry (wikipedia article) said.

Its fabulous wealth made it a vital resource to the princes of Tver, but also tempted the powerful dukes of Moscow, who attempted to seize the mine in a series of wars that sprawled across the land that is now Russia from 1305 to 1485. “After the fall of the Principality of Tver, it continued to be mined by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and its successor regime until the mine was closed in the mid-18th century due to being exhausted,” the entry said.

So yeah, I feel confident in saying you're a plagiarist.

----- __595.2__ -----2022-07-06 11:08:31+08:00:

If by that you mean the fake Russian articles, I mean it got attention when it did the rounds a few days ago. If you mean the plagiarism, I only posted 20 mins ago...

### 596: [Why didn't Indian and Chinese Empires Ever Interact?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vsogwc/why_didnt_indian_and_chinese_empires_ever_interact/), submitted on 2022-07-06 20:06:50+08:00.

----- __596.1__ -----2022-07-06 21:49:15+08:00:

More can of course be said for other periods, but I discuss the Qing context (drawing primarily from Matthew Mosca's excellent *From Frontier Policy to Foreign Policy*) in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qlfr99/how_was_the_relationship_between_qing_china_and/hj65yek/).

----- __596.2__ -----2022-07-07 02:45:33+08:00:

A great answer, but I do wish to note a little quibble:

> before which the Tibetans were vassals who rarely had to interact with Beijing

The only imperial Chinese states which had meaningful control over Tibet were the Mongol Yuan between 1244 and 1354 and the Manchu Qing from ca. 1720 to 1911, during which their rule in the region was quite extensive. However, for basically the rest of Tibetan history, the Chinese presence in Tibet was extremely ephemeral, and nationalist Chinese narratives of a historic suzerainty over Tibet are nonsensical at best.
