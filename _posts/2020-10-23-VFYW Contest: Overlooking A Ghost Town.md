It&#8217;s got to be Norway, with the road shimmying along the edge of the water with a steep embankment&nbsp;to the alternating side. I think that&#8217;s a linden tree to the left. But that&#8217;s all I got!</p></blockquote><p>Another got egg on his face at Lake Bled, Slovenia:</p><blockquote><p>I spent a lovely weekend there in July 2018. I had a very embarrassing incident involving a swing by the edge of the lake.</p></blockquote><p>I had to ask for a followup: </p><blockquote><p>So I was swimming at the lake with a few friends, having just arrived from Dublin. Egged on by my friends, I made the uncharacteristically bold decision to climb on the large tree swing and wind it back until there wasn&#8217;t a pinch of slack left. I took a deep breath, lifted my feet, and off I went. Before I knew it, I was at the apex of the pendulum, suspended above the water. It was time to let go, but I didn&#8217;t. I somehow forgot to.</p><p>Now I&#8217;m hurtling back towards the tree, going what feels like triple the speed. I&#8217;m too paralyzed by fear at this point to let go. I close my eyes and wait for my fate to unfold. The impact nearly crushes me and I hit the dry ground with a thud. Silence &#8230; followed by an eruption of laughter from what sounded like everybody in Slovenia.</p></blockquote><p>A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Lake+Bled,+Slovenia&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS776US776&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYmMmBh8rsAhXqhOAKHa56D0kQ_AUoAXoECBkQAw&amp;biw=1221&amp;bih=617">beautiful place</a> to be embarrassed, though:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-879-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e01a93a-4f98-4b72-95cb-a848bfbb389a_4000x2415.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e01a93a-4f98-4b72-95cb-a848bfbb389a_4000x2415.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e01a93a-4f98-4b72-95cb-a848bfbb389a_4000x2415.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:879,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4444305,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-879-1456 {            padding-bottom: 60.37087912087912%;            padding-bottom: min(60.37087912087912%, 879px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-879-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 879px;          }        </style></a><p>Another reader:</p><blockquote><p>This looks like Lucerne, Switzerland. I sang at the Lucern Festival nearly 20&nbsp;years ago, so my memory could be deceiving me. If it is Lucerne, I believe it is shot from the old city wall.</p></blockquote><p>Another jumps to the right continent:</p><blockquote><p>The limestone and the hills in the distance scream upper New York State to me. I&#8217;ll go with Ithaca because it&#8217;s more or less in the middle, but I figure it could be a courthouse or a hospital built in the late 19th&nbsp;century, pretty much anywhere between Jamestown and Albany.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another crosses the right national border by guessing &#8220;Waterton Lakes, Alberta, Canada.&#8221; But this next reader gets the right province, the right town, the right building:</p><blockquote><p>FINALLY, FINALLY, FINALLY!  </p><p>After several years of spending an hour or two or ten each week &#8212; okay, we all had a nice hiatus the last few years &#8212; trying to sleuth out the location of the VFYW and then quitting in frustration because I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m even on the right continent (which is usually confirmed when the winner is announced), I was 99% sure I knew at least the continent, country and province right away. &#8220;That has to be the interior of BC!&#8221; I screamed at my computer screen.

An additional shout-out to Edward Charles Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, the British banker and head of Baring Brothers,&nbsp;for whom the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelstoke,_British_Columbia">town of Revelstoke</a> was eventually named&nbsp;(after being first known as Second Crossing and then Farwell). He <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Baring,_1st_Baron_Revelstoke">looks like money</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Based on the dozens of entries this week, it was very easy to get the right building, very difficult to get the right room. This reader suggests why:</p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s definitely the Three Valley Lake Chateau. I wish I could be more exact than that, but it&#8217;s frustratingly hard to find a property map of this place. I&#8217;m reasonably sure it&#8217;s on the second floor, judging by the slight elevation and the color of the railing. See my attached photo for best guess on the room:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-448-900" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a5e4144-4a13-4331-9c00-f77417ec8666_900x448.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a5e4144-4a13-4331-9c00-f77417ec8666_900x448.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a5e4144-4a13-4331-9c00-f77417ec8666_900x448.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:448,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:167371,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-448-900 {            padding-bottom: 49.77777777777778%;            padding-bottom: min(49.77777777777778%, 448px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-448-900 img {            max-width: 900px;            max-height: 448px;          }        </style></a></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s more to Three Valley Lake than the chateau, as this reader explains:</p><blockquote><p>The official name of this place is Three Valley Lake Chateau and Heritage Ghost Town. They have 200 rooms for rent, and a creepy abandoned ghost town right next to it. Many people came to these parts of Canada in the late 1800s in search of gold. This town was developed around 1862. Amongst the spooky attractions, they have 25 historical buildings, an auto museum, and a railway roundhouse. </p><p>According to their web site, the roundhouse is &#8220;home to the largest fully operational covered turntable in North America.

Triangulating trees, ornamental bridges, and flower patches identifies the window as belonging to room 310:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-716-1280" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4176461b-127b-42d5-b724-0bdf3b857a2f_1280x716.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4176461b-127b-42d5-b724-0bdf3b857a2f_1280x716.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4176461b-127b-42d5-b724-0bdf3b857a2f_1280x716.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:716,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:473972,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-716-1280 {            padding-bottom: 55.93749999999999%;            padding-bottom: min(55.93749999999999%, 716px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-716-1280 img {            max-width: 1280px;            max-height: 716px;          }        </style></a></blockquote><p>From the reader who submitting the photo:</p><blockquote><p>The picture was taken in room 310 of the Three&nbsp;Valley&nbsp;Lake Chateau in 3 Valley Gap, BC. I&#8217;m so chuffed to see it chosen for the contest, made my day.&nbsp;</p><p>For vacation this year, we decided to stay pretty close to home (Fraser Valley, BC), but we still wanted to do something we had never done before. So we planned our trip around white water rafting on the <a href="https://wildwater.com/kicking-horse-white-water-rafting/">Kicking Horse River</a>. We didn&#8217;t have a set schedule other than the pre-booked rafting trip and a short list of places to see: Banff, Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, and MIL&#8217;s grave in Canmore. When we felt we had driven far enough each&nbsp;day,&nbsp;we searched for an available hotel. </p><p>On the way through 3 Valley Gap going to Banff, we remarked how often we had been past the Chateau but had never stayed there. So we resolved to do so on the way back, just because. The&nbsp;picture&nbsp;was taken in the morning just before we left to go home.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>This week: <strong>Three Valley Gap, British Columbia. </strong>Next week:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-1061-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbadb2ae3-3367-4b88-ab13-22c12ca5981b_1782x1298.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbadb2ae3-3367-4b88-ab13-22c12ca5981b_1782x1298.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/badb2ae3-3367-4b88-ab13-22c12ca5981b_1782x1298.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1061,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4267077,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-1061-1456 {            padding-bottom: 72.87087912087912%;            padding-bottom: min(72.87087912087912%, 1061px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-1061-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 1061px;          }        </style></a><p>So, where is it?
