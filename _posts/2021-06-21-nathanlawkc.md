Thank you so much @jaynordlinger  for doing this in-depth podcast with me. We've covered my journey of becoming a prominent activist and being the voice of Hong Kong. We need more support from the international community. <br>#StandWithHongKong <a href="https://ricochet.com/podcast/q-and-a/an-inspiring-young-leader-from-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ricochet.com/podcast/q-and-a/an-inspiring-young-leader-from-hong-kong/</a>

This is a landmark case. The most vocal Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily is forced to close, and its owner and directors face Nationa Security Law charges. <br>Press freedom is gone.<br><br>Hong Kong’s Apple Daily could shut at weekend unless accounts are unblocked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/hong-kong-apple-daily-newspaper-crisis-talks-avert-shutdown-advisor-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/hong-kong-apple-daily-newspaper-crisis-talks-avert-shutdown-advisor-says</a>

"The high commissioner criticized the application of China’s National Security Law in Hong Kong. She noted this was having a chilling impact on the territory’s civic and democratic space.

This is one of the most disgusting attacks on press freedom.

Re 2. The parent company of Apple Daily, Next Digital Limited, is a listed company. The govt forced a listed company to close itself in a matter of days, though signs have been there for months.

Re 3. By arresting executives, journalists and freezing the asserts, the companies cannot pay their staffers, and staffers are afraid of being arrested. The paper with a history of 26 years is gone. The companies and the arresstees are not even trialed yet.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k4GR3XEAYSZjQ?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 4. Apple Daily is a popular newspaper. It ranked 3rd most credible newspaper in the latest poll by a university research institute. People supporting democracy support them as well. Apple daily is murdered by an authoritarian regime, with the latest weaponized legal state.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k4QgaWYAMfjh9?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 5. More than 1000 workers lost their jobs. A charity operated by Apple Daily that subsidizes underprivileged patients to pay for expensive patent drugs is also closed immediately. They lost all fundings. People lost more than a news channel that dares to speak differently.

Re 6. Supporters vowed their support to the paper outside its building on its last day. It's a heartbreaking scene, and the govt singlehanded created this tragedy. CCP does not tolerate truth and independent journalism. They crush our civil society, our proud tradition.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k3QLaXMAI7yjJ?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 7. We are saddened, but we won't give up. I will continue the work in the diasporic community, with supporting more on reporting on the ground and preserving its culture. Hope all of you are also supporting the struggles of Hong Kong people as well. <br>#StandWithHongKong <br>-END<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k5VxiXEAYv9hk?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
