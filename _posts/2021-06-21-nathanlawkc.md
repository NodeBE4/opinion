Thank you so much @jaynordlinger  for doing this in-depth podcast with me. We've covered my journey of becoming a prominent activist and being the voice of Hong Kong. We need more support from the international community. <br>#StandWithHongKong <a href="https://ricochet.com/podcast/q-and-a/an-inspiring-young-leader-from-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ricochet.com/podcast/q-and-a/an-inspiring-young-leader-from-hong-kong/</a>

1. Most of you may not understand how dreadful the closure of Apple Daily means to Hong Kong. Not only to its journalistic landscape, but also to the people and the city itself. This is their last day. They are going to print 1 million copies tomorrow to commerate the fight.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k35ViXIAUu_Nc?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. By arresting executives, journalists and freezing the asserts, the companies cannot pay their staffers, and staffers are afraid of being arrested. The paper with a history of 26 years is gone. The companies and the arresstees are not even trialed yet.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k4GR3XEAYSZjQ?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 4. Apple Daily is a popular newspaper. It ranked 3rd most credible newspaper in the latest poll by a university research institute. People supporting democracy support them as well. Apple daily is murdered by an authoritarian regime, with the latest weaponized legal state.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k4QgaWYAMfjh9?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 5. More than 1000 workers lost their jobs. A charity operated by Apple Daily that subsidizes underprivileged patients to pay for expensive patent drugs is also closed immediately. They lost all fundings. People lost more than a news channel that dares to speak differently.

Re 6. Supporters vowed their support to the paper outside its building on its last day. It's a heartbreaking scene, and the govt singlehanded created this tragedy. CCP does not tolerate truth and independent journalism. They crush our civil society, our proud tradition.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k3QLaXMAI7yjJ?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 7. We are saddened, but we won't give up. I will continue the work in the diasporic community, with supporting more on reporting on the ground and preserving its culture. Hope all of you are also supporting the struggles of Hong Kong people as well. <br>#StandWithHongKong <br>-END<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4k5VxiXEAYv9hk?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

The experiences of Apple Daily reflect the efforts of the Chinese government to replicate the mainland's media climate on the island. This was clearly shown in the 2021 Press Freedom Index, in which Hong Kong fell from 54th to 80th globally. <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/beijing-s-battle-to-crush-hong-kong-s-final-freedoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/beijing-s-battle-to-crush-hong-kong-s-final-freedoms</a>
