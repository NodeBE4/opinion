Either for being lifeless or for smelling, which uh... would this not be true of literally any other concert experience? Unless of course they were allegedly singling out the mostly-white audience which we know it was because this was a concert that took place in Japan in July 2022 which is of course when you would naturally expect many white people to be there.

I've no idea if it was bullshit at the time and if it's still accepted now, but many years ago I read an article that noted that money correlates with happiness *up to a point*, that being where your perceived basic needs are met *and* you have a certain amount to spend on yourself. So even if there are plenty of people who are at the point where more money won't make a difference, there are plenty more who aren't.

----- __684.1__ -----2022-08-09 11:12:38+08:00:

Hans van de Ven's *China at War* is relatively recent and probably the best militaristically-inclined approach to the Second Sino-Japanese War, and also has a somewhat compressed but still decent denouement covering the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. My only real quibble with it is with van de Ven's interpretation of the role of guerrilla warfare in Clausewitz and in turn its interpretation by Mao, insofar as I think Clausewitz's thinking was more similar to Mao's than he makes out, and that in turn Mao's approach to Clausewitz was thus not hugely innovative.

----- __684.2__ -----2022-08-09 11:42:24+08:00:

To be fair, he does not cover policy as much. For that, and for a more in-depth set of nuts-and-bolts discussions, you'll want Peattie and Drea's edited volume *The Battle for China*, which consists of a series of articles discussing various elements of the Nationalist and Japanese war efforts at various levels.

### 685: [me irl](https://old.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/wk28bv/me_irl/), submitted on 2022-08-09 20:37:18+08:00.

----- __685.1__ -----2022-08-10 03:31:07+08:00:

Unluckily for you, the signs are in Cantonese rather than Mandarin (both the lexicon and the rhyme scheme give that away). Also unluckily, the phrases are not translations of each other, but rather phrases with similar (intended) meaning. Fortunately for you, I do speak Cantonese, and am willing to at least claim to be your friend for the purposes of translating.

'You are my love my angle don't treat me like potato' originally would have meant, idiomatically, 'I treat you like a jewel, don't treat me like swamp grass'. So, no potatoes here.

'You talk like angel walk like model but your body look like buffalo' originally would have been 'looking from a distance you are picturesque, looking up close you're a pork chop'. This requires a couple of explanations. The phrase in the first clause meaning 'picturesque' is actually miswritten as Â¶ÇÁµ≤Â¶ÇÁï´ 'like silk, like artwork' instead of the standard Â¶ÇË©©Â¶ÇÁï´ 'like poetry, like artwork'; this is, by the by, another giveaway that it's Cantonese because both Áµ≤ and Ë©© are *si1* in Cantonese, but *si1* and *shi1* respectively in Mandarin. The term 'pork chop' is Cantonese slang for an unattractive woman.

You can actually find the full sign for the rambo phrase here: https://preview.redd.it/fk8q423um1l21.jpg?auto=webp&s=cc1a8b6d447add7cbbb26d31cb3366a83855f4b7. Idiomatically, the Cantonese would be along the lines of 'your head is big but you have no brain; your brain is just a big pile of grass'. No potatoes here either.

Cantonese (at least HK Cantonese, other varieties may be different) for 'potato' is ËñØ‰ªî *syu4 zai2*.

----- __685.2__ -----2022-08-10 03:39:37+08:00:

It depends how you speak it, and whether you do so as your first language. In the case of Hong Kong Cantonese speakers, there are certain distinctions in tone and emphasis from American/Commonwealth English speakers. In particular, there tends to be one syllable that gets pitched up and held, but never the final one, which is always a bit de-emphasised and so sound differences are not as obvious. So for instance *a-n*gel, po*ta-*to, *mo-*del, *buff-*alo. Secondly, Cantonese doesn't have a final 'l' sound, so it is often replaced by simply holding the vowel. What that means is 'angel' ends up sounding like 'ain-jo', which would rhyme with 'potato', and similarly 'model' becomes 'mod-oh', which would rhyme with 'buffalo'.

So no, they don't rhyme in 'standard' British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, or American English, but they do rhyme in strongly Cantonese-accented English.

### 686: [AMA: Female Pirates](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wk2yfu/ama_female_pirates/), submitted on 2022-08-09 21:11:10+08:00.

----- __686.1__ -----2022-08-09 21:38:01+08:00:

Hello and thanks for coming on! I'll try to make this a question rather than a statement.

In the admittedly somewhat cursory reading I've done on the Red Flag pirates of early 19th century China, a theme that seems to have emerged is that the role of Ching Shih (also known by other names) in the fleet was deliberately exaggerated by elite male Qing authors to emphasise the pirates' deviation from orthodox social norms. How did gender affect how female pirates were written about compared to their male counterparts? I suppose a necessary corollary to that is, *who* wrote about pirates? How strongly do women's voices feature in the source landscape?

----- __686.2__ -----2022-08-10 00:09:45+08:00:

Thank you!

----- __686.3__ -----2022-08-10 03:50:31+08:00:

Now that you mention it, I honestly cannot remember at this point; as noted it's not really my subfield at all and it has been a long time since I did that reading. It *might* have been Murray but to be honest, it might even have been an older post on AH by a user whose name I have long since forgotten. It's worth noting by the by that 'Zheng Yi Sao' is in fact 'wife of Zheng Yi', so 'Ching I's widow' is in fact the same term, just not using Pinyin Romanisation.

### 690: [The Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong was inhabited by more than 33.000 people. Between 1987 and 1992, the city was evicted to be demolished. How were the logistics of relocating and re-employing so many people over only five years solved?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wl89ir/the_kowloon_walled_city_in_hong_kong_was/), submitted on 2022-08-11 04:43:45+08:00.

----- __690.1__ -----2022-08-11 13:12:53+08:00:

The answer above, and indeed the question, necessarily presume a little bit of background knowledge on the Walled City which not all readers may have, so I'm filling that in in order to pre-empt what I think may end up being the most common follow-up questions on that count.

Firstly, it is important to note that while the first Google results for 'Kowloon' give you the Walled City, Kowloon and the Kowloon Walled City are not synonymous terms. Kowloon, from Cantonese ‰πùÈæç *gau2 lung4* ('nine dragons'), has had two meanings historically. Firstly, it referred to the 47km^2 peninsula ceded to Britain under the Convention of Peking in 1860, bounded on the north side by the appropriately-named Boundary Street. Secondly, it referred to a town to the northeast of that ceded territory, which would later become the Kowloon Walled City (‰πùÈæçÂØ®Âüé *gau2 lung4 zaai6 seng4*). In the decades after the New Territories lease in 1898, the urban area of Kowloon expanded significantly, so the modern-day boundaries of Kowloon, which encompass the districts of Kowloon City, Kwun Tong, Sham Shui Po, Wong Tai Sin, and Yau Tsum Mong, include a further 20 km^2 or so of land that was leased in 1898 rather than ceded in 1860; this whole area was known as Kowloon by at least 1982, when the precursor to the modern district boundaries were laid down. The Walled City, which by this stage was no longer simply called 'Kowloon', formed a small enclave within what is now the district of Kowloon City. Nor was it dominant in population terms: the upper-end estimate of 50,000 residents would have constituted less than 2.5% of the 2.03 million residents of Kowloon, and less than 1% of the roughly 5.67 million residents of Hong Kong as a whole.

The emergence of the Walled City relates directly to the aforementioned treaties. The 1898 lease explicitly excluded 'the city of Kowloon', which the Qing used as a military outpost, and it remained under *de jure* Qing jurisdiction until the imperial state fell in 1912. Its ambiguous legal status meant that there was no investment in the area by British public authorities, and both the Republic of China and latterly the People's Republic of China would claim to continue the Qing's jurisdiction, but had very little means of enforcing it through British territory. This put the Walled City in a bit of a legal loophole where the British colonial government had no jurisdiction to exercise, while the mainland governments claimed jurisdiction but could not meaningfully exercise it. The Walled City in the form it is best known ‚Äì a dense chunk of buildings up to 14 storeys high, crisscrossed by damp alleyways ‚Äì was the result of considerable construction works that took place in the 1960s, as the Walled City essentially became a high-rise version of the earlier squatter communities mentioned in the above answer, housing those who could not afford to live elsewhere, either for financial reasons or because of one's involvement in illicit businesses.
