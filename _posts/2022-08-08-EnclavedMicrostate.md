I mean, Thermopylae is one of the most famous Greek military defeats, and if you dig past any of the gloss it achieved zilch. Not much to commemorate.

['Not one POC in sight'](https://twitter.com/Musuugi/status/1556812374006501379) says one user.

The concert. Was in fucking *Japan*.

I'm half-wondering if there's something else at work with the actual user ‚Äì their bio mentions being able to speak Korean and 'Chinese' (which specific Sinitic language is, as ever, never specified), and I'm curious if there's some unmentioned anti-Japanese sentiment involved.

----- __682.4__ -----2022-08-09 12:11:24+08:00:

Either for being lifeless or for smelling, which uh... would this not be true of literally any other concert experience? Unless of course they were allegedly singling out the mostly-white audience which we know it was because this was a concert that took place in Japan in July 2022 which is of course when you would naturally expect many white people to be there.

### 684: [What Works provide an Overview of the Sino-Japanese War (1937) from a Military Policy Perspective?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wjisry/what_works_provide_an_overview_of_the/), submitted on 2022-08-09 04:10:19+08:00.

Hans van de Ven's *China at War* is relatively recent and probably the best militaristically-inclined approach to the Second Sino-Japanese War, and also has a somewhat compressed but still decent denouement covering the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. My only real quibble with it is with van de Ven's interpretation of the role of guerrilla warfare in Clausewitz and in turn its interpretation by Mao, insofar as I think Clausewitz's thinking was more similar to Mao's than he makes out, and that in turn Mao's approach to Clausewitz was thus not hugely innovative.

----- __684.2__ -----2022-08-09 11:42:24+08:00:

To be fair, he does not cover policy as much. For that, and for a more in-depth set of nuts-and-bolts discussions, you'll want Peattie and Drea's edited volume *The Battle for China*, which consists of a series of articles discussing various elements of the Nationalist and Japanese war efforts at various levels.
