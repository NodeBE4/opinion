I mean, Thermopylae is one of the most famous Greek military defeats, and if you dig past any of the gloss it achieved zilch. Not much to commemorate.

The concert. Was in fucking *Japan*.

I'm half-wondering if there's something else at work with the actual user ‚Äì their bio mentions being able to speak Korean and 'Chinese' (which specific Sinitic language is, as ever, never specified), and I'm curious if there's some unmentioned anti-Japanese sentiment involved.

----- __682.4__ -----2022-08-09 12:11:24+08:00:

Either for being lifeless or for smelling, which uh... would this not be true of literally any other concert experience? Unless of course they were allegedly singling out the mostly-white audience which we know it was because this was a concert that took place in Japan in July 2022 which is of course when you would naturally expect many white people to be there.

As the others have noted, that company was Cover. Miko has said she was directly scouted by Yagoo.

Pretty much. kuromaru made the first concept images for Roboco in 2013 and the model was finished in late May 2016, with the first animations around late 2017 if I'm not mistaken.

I've no idea if it was bullshit at the time and if it's still accepted now, but many years ago I read an article that noted that money correlates with happiness *up to a point*, that being where your perceived basic needs are met *and* you have a certain amount to spend on yourself. So even if there are plenty of people who are at the point where more money won't make a difference, there are plenty more who aren't.

----- __684.1__ -----2022-08-09 11:12:38+08:00:

Hans van de Ven's *China at War* is relatively recent and probably the best militaristically-inclined approach to the Second Sino-Japanese War, and also has a somewhat compressed but still decent denouement covering the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. My only real quibble with it is with van de Ven's interpretation of the role of guerrilla warfare in Clausewitz and in turn its interpretation by Mao, insofar as I think Clausewitz's thinking was more similar to Mao's than he makes out, and that in turn Mao's approach to Clausewitz was thus not hugely innovative.

----- __684.2__ -----2022-08-09 11:42:24+08:00:

To be fair, he does not cover policy as much. For that, and for a more in-depth set of nuts-and-bolts discussions, you'll want Peattie and Drea's edited volume *The Battle for China*, which consists of a series of articles discussing various elements of the Nationalist and Japanese war efforts at various levels.

Unluckily for you, the signs are in Cantonese rather than Mandarin (both the lexicon and the rhyme scheme give that away). Also unluckily, the phrases are not translations of each other, but rather phrases with similar (intended) meaning. Fortunately for you, I do speak Cantonese, and am willing to at least claim to be your friend for the purposes of translating.

'You are my love my angle don't treat me like potato' originally would have meant, idiomatically, 'I treat you like a jewel, don't treat me like swamp grass'. So, no potatoes here.

'You talk like angel walk like model but your body look like buffalo' originally would have been 'looking from a distance you are picturesque, looking up close you're a pork chop'. This requires a couple of explanations. The phrase in the first clause meaning 'picturesque' is actually miswritten as Â¶ÇÁµ≤Â¶ÇÁï´ 'like silk, like artwork' instead of the standard Â¶ÇË©©Â¶ÇÁï´ 'like poetry, like artwork'; this is, by the by, another giveaway that it's Cantonese because both Áµ≤ and Ë©© are *si1* in Cantonese, but *si1* and *shi1* respectively in Mandarin. The term 'pork chop' is Cantonese slang for an unattractive woman.

You can actually find the full sign for the rambo phrase here: https://preview.redd.it/fk8q423um1l21.jpg?auto=webp&s=cc1a8b6d447add7cbbb26d31cb3366a83855f4b7. Idiomatically, the Cantonese would be along the lines of 'your head is big but you have no brain; your brain is just a big pile of grass'. No potatoes here either.

Cantonese (at least HK Cantonese, other varieties may be different) for 'potato' is ËñØ‰ªî *syu4 zai2*.

----- __685.2__ -----2022-08-10 03:39:37+08:00:

It depends how you speak it, and whether you do so as your first language. In the case of Hong Kong Cantonese speakers, there are certain distinctions in tone and emphasis from American/Commonwealth English speakers. In particular, there tends to be one syllable that gets pitched up and held, but never the final one, which is always a bit de-emphasised and so sound differences are not as obvious. So for instance *a-n*gel, po*ta-*to, *mo-*del, *buff-*alo. Secondly, Cantonese doesn't have a final 'l' sound, so it is often replaced by simply holding the vowel. What that means is 'angel' ends up sounding like 'ain-jo', which would rhyme with 'potato', and similarly 'model' becomes 'mod-oh', which would rhyme with 'buffalo'.

So no, they don't rhyme in 'standard' British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, or American English, but they do rhyme in strongly Cantonese-accented English.

### 686: [AMA: Female Pirates](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wk2yfu/ama_female_pirates/), submitted on 2022-08-09 21:11:10+08:00.

----- __686.1__ -----2022-08-09 21:38:01+08:00:

Hello and thanks for coming on! I'll try to make this a question rather than a statement.

In the admittedly somewhat cursory reading I've done on the Red Flag pirates of early 19th century China, a theme that seems to have emerged is that the role of Ching Shih (also known by other names) in the fleet was deliberately exaggerated by elite male Qing authors to emphasise the pirates' deviation from orthodox social norms. How did gender affect how female pirates were written about compared to their male counterparts? I suppose a necessary corollary to that is, *who* wrote about pirates? How strongly do women's voices feature in the source landscape?

----- __686.2__ -----2022-08-10 00:09:45+08:00:

Thank you!

----- __686.3__ -----2022-08-10 03:50:31+08:00:

Now that you mention it, I honestly cannot remember at this point; as noted it's not really my subfield at all and it has been a long time since I did that reading. It *might* have been Murray but to be honest, it might even have been an older post on AH by a user whose name I have long since forgotten. It's worth noting by the by that 'Zheng Yi Sao' is in fact 'wife of Zheng Yi', so 'Ching I's widow' is in fact the same term, just not using Pinyin Romanisation.

Unfortunately, the academically solid material is, in some instances, rather inaccessible. However, while much of Rafe de Crespigny's oeuvre is, as you have discovered, extremely pricey in print copy, the Australian National University has graciously made almost all of his key works available as free PDFs through its Open Research Repository:
