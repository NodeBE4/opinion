### 253: [How to Make Biden’s Free World Strategy Work: It’s Not as Simple as Pitting Democracy Against Autocracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/uwtlup/how_to_make_bidens_free_world_strategy_work_its/), submitted on 2022-05-24 23:35:15+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Hal Brands, Professor of Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\]

"Crises illuminate the contours of world affairs, and the war in Ukraine has had a clarifying effect on the Biden administration’s approach to the world. Since taking office, U.S. President Joe Biden has argued that the struggle between democracy and autocracy is the defining clash of our time, even as critics and some members of his administration haven’t always agreed. For Biden, at least, the Russian invasion and the world’s response to it has proved that he was right all along.

In his State of Union address in early March, Biden described the war in Ukraine as a battle between freedom and tyranny. In Warsaw a few weeks later, in another speech replete with Cold War echoes, the president announced that Washington would lead the free world to victory in a great struggle “between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.”

Biden has good reason to be hitting these themes hard. The Russian invasion has shown how deeply the struggle to shape global order is rooted in opposing conceptions of domestic order. It has clarified and intensified the struggle between advanced democracies and Eurasian autocracies. And it has given Biden’s foreign policy, which seemed headed for frustration if not outright failure just a few months ago, a new lease on life. Yet critics of the democracy-autocracy thesis aren’t wrong to argue that the world isn’t quite so simple. Winning this contest of systems will require crafting a strategy that takes these complexities into account.

Biden must first specify what Washington opposes—not the existence of autocracy but that combination of tyranny, power, and hostility that so threatens the United States and the international order it has built. He must then flesh out his concept of the “free world,” a familiar term that can be more flexible than it sounds. Finally, his administration must address four key problems that this framing implies. A free-world strategy can help Washington prevent this century from becoming an age of autocratic advantage—but it raises pointed questions about who’s in, who’s out, and how to navigate a world that is increasingly divided and stubbornly interdependent at the same time."

\[SS from the article by R. James Breiding\]

"It has been 21 years since Carolyn Loughton lay helplessly with her lifeless daughter in her arms and Australians woke up to the need to reform their gun laws. Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control. In the 18 years before the 1996 reforms, Australia suffered 13 gun massacres. Since then, there has not been a single one. But how did Australia succeed in passing these reforms, and what can the United States learn from them today?"

### 260: [Every City Needs a Chief Heat Officer: A First Step Toward Adapting to Deadly High Temperatures](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/uy9v2w/every_city_needs_a_chief_heat_officer_a_first/), submitted on 2022-05-26 23:14:07+08:00.

----- __260.1__ -----2022-05-26 23:15:45+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Kathy Baughman McLeod, Director of the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht–Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center\]

"Global warming is already harming the current and future U.S. workforce. Extreme heat costs the United States more than $100 billion per year due to reduced worker productivity: people get sick, slow down, and make mistakes due to the physical effects of heat. Children’s school performance can decline as temperatures soar. According to researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles, each one degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature during the academic school year reduces the amount learned that year by one percent—and students from low-income and minority groups are the ones most affected.  


City dwellers—some 55 percent of the world’s population, or about 4.2 billion people—are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The asphalt, cement, glass, and steel that are features of most urban areas are especially efficient at absorbing, retaining, and emanating heat. The so-called heat island effect can cause temperatures up to seven degrees Fahrenheit hotter in urban environments than in suburbs and rural regions, which have more green space and foliage.  


A relatively simple way in which cities can protect their residents is by putting someone in charge of responding to the most harmful effects of climate change.  After all, cities have departments for fighting fires and for coordinating responses to regional floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. But just a handful of cities in the world have someone whose job it is to craft and implement plans to respond to rising temperatures. To save lives, every municipal leader should appoint a chief heat officer, or CHO."
