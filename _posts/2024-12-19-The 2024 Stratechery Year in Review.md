<p>Stratechery, incredibly enough, has been my full-time job for over a decade; this is the 12th year-in-review. Here are the previous editions:</p><div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-2023-stratechery-year-in-review/">2023</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-2022-stratechery-year-in-review/">2022</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/the-2021-stratechery-year-in-review/">2021</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-2020-stratechery-year-in-review/">2020</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-2019-stratechery-year-in-review/">2019</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-2018-stratechery-year-in-review/">2018</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-2017-stratechery-year-in-review/">2017</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-2016-stratechery-year-in-review/">2016</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/the-stratechery-2015-year-in-review/">2015</a> | <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/stratechery-2014-year-review/">2014</a> | <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/stratechery-2013-year-review/">2013</a></div><p>It has long been a useful cliché to say that covering tech is easy, because something is always happening; now that that something is AI, that is more true than ever. Nearly every Article on Stratechery this year was about AI in some way or another, and that is likely to be true for years to come.</p><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-gen-ai-bridge-to-the-future/"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-9.png?resize=640%2C221&#038;ssl=1" alt="A drawing of The Generative AI Bridge" width="640" height="221" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13968" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-9.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-9.png?resize=300%2C103&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-9.png?resize=1024%2C353&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-9.png?resize=768%2C265&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/generative-ai-bridge-9.png?resize=1200%2C413&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p><p>This year Stratechery published 29 free <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/articles/">Articles</a>, 109 subscriber <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/daily-email/">Updates</a>, and 40 <a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">Interviews</a>. Today, as per tradition, I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year.</p><h3>The Five Most-Viewed Articles</h3><p>The five most-viewed articles on Stratechery according to page views:</p><ol><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/intel-honesty/">Intel Honesty</a> — The best way to both save Intel and have leading edge manufacturing in the U.S. is to split the company, and for the U.S. government to pick up the bill via purchase guarantees.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/gemini-and-googles-culture/">Gemini and Google&#8217;s Culture</a> — The Google Gemini fiasco shows that the biggest challenge for Google in AI is not business model but rather company culture; change is needed from the top down.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/intels-humbling/">Intel&#8217;s Humbling</a> — Intel under Pat Gelsinger is reaping the disaster that came from a lack of investment and execution a decade ago; the company, though, appears to be headed in the right direction, as evidenced by its execution and recent deal with UMC.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pro/">The Apple Vision Pro</a> — The Apple Vision Pro is a disappointment for productivity, in part because of choices made to deliver a remarkable entertainment experience. Plus, the future of AR/VR for Apple and Meta.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/mkbhds-for-everything/">MKBHDs For Everything</a> — Marques Brownlee has tremendous power because he can go direct to consumers; that is possible in media, and AI will make it possible everywhere.</li></ol><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pros-missing-apps/"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-apps-4.png?resize=640%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="A drawing of The Carrot and Stick of the iTunes Music Store" width="640" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12204" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-apps-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-apps-4.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-apps-4.png?resize=1024%2C623&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-apps-4.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vision-pro-apps-4.png?resize=1035%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1035w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p><h3>AI and the Future</h3><p>Looking ahead to how AI will change everything.</p><ul><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/enterprise-philosophy-and-the-first-wave-of-ai/">Enterprise Philosophy and The First Wave of AI</a> — The first wave of successful AI implementations will probably look more like the first wave of computing, which was dominated by large-scale enterprise installations that eliminated jobs. Consumer will come later. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cgjWHzFdj4"><em>YouTube</em></a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-gen-ai-bridge-to-the-future/">The Gen AI Bridge to the Future</a> — Generative AI is the bridge to the next computing paradigm of wearables, just like the Internet bridged the gap from PCs to smartphones.</li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-new-york-times-ai-opportunity/">The New York Times&#8217; AI Opportunity</a> — The New York Times is suing OpenAI, but it is the New York Times that stands to benefit the most from large language models, thanks to its transformation to being an Internet entity. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v963NrVgK-w"><em>YouTube</em></a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/ai-integration-and-modularization/">AI Integration and Modularization</a> — Breaking down the Big Tech AI landscape through the lens of integration and modularization. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4e693Vbwdo"><em>YouTube</em></a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/aggregators-ai-risk/">Aggregator&#8217;s AI Risk</a> — A single AI can never make everyone happy, which is fundamentally threatening to the Aggregator business model; the solution is personalized AI. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Q7uI2REI0"><em>YouTube</em></a></li></ul><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/ai-integration-and-modularization/"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/integration-modularization-ai-4.png?resize=640%2C401&#038;ssl=1" alt="A drawing of Google&#039;s Integrated AI Stack" width="640" height="401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13039" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/integration-modularization-ai-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/integration-modularization-ai-4.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/integration-modularization-ai-4.png?resize=1024%2C642&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/integration-modularization-ai-4.png?resize=768%2C481&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/integration-modularization-ai-4.png?resize=1005%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1005w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p><h3>Government and Regulation</h3><p>An emerging theme this year — which <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/rapidus-the-end-of-economic-rationality-ai-disruption/">I expect to continue</a> alongside AI — is the rising importance of non-economic factors in terms of technological development, even as regulators ramp up pressure on the giants of the Aggregator era.</p><ul><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/a-chance-to-build/">A Chance to Build</a> — Silicon Valley has always been deeply integrated with Asia; Trump&#8217;s attempt to change trade could hurt Silicon Valley more than expected, and also present opportunities to build something new. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rKj79A1D44"><em>YouTube</em></a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/intels-death-and-potential-revival/">Intel&#8217;s Death and Potential Revival</a> — Intel died when mobile cost it its software differentiation; if the U.S. wants a domestic foundry, then it ought to leverage the need for AI chips to make an independent Intel foundry viable. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGPdfV7evFU"><em>YouTube</em></a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-e-u-goes-too-far/">The E.U. Goes Too Far</a> — Recent E.U. regulatory decisions cross the line from market correction to property theft; if the E.U. continues down this path they are likely to see fewer new features and no new companies. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSqAM8qb47g"><em>YouTube</em></a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/friendly-google-and-enemy-remedies/">Friendly Google and Enemy Remedies</a> — The DOJ brought the right kind of case against an Aggregator, which stagnates by being too nice; the goal is for companies to act like they actually have enemies. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfAkw0EGISw"><em>YouTube</em></a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/united-states-v-apple/">United States v.

Lessons</a> — SpaceX&#8217;s triumph is downstream of a dream and getting the cost structure necessary to make it happen; Elon Musk is trying the same approach for Tesla self-driving cars. <a
