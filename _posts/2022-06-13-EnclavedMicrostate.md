### 529: [Primetime Parasocial Party - Weekly Discussion Thread, June 13th, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/vbfqlf/primetime_parasocial_party_weekly_discussion/), submitted on 2022-06-14 00:11:11+08:00.

A sort of issue would be that there are different Chineses (to use the phrase clumsily), and at present there's a roughly 2:1 ratio (from what metrics I recall) of predominantly Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese viewers to Cantonese-speaking HK viewers, setting aside the possibility of VPN-using viewers doing things like superchatting via HKD and NTD. So unlike back when there was a bilibili presence and the vast majority of what I'll term 'Sinospheric' viewers were Mandarin-speakers, we've moved to an environment where ostensibly one third of 'Chinese' viewers speak a different language from the other two thirds.

I'd imagine a loosening up of language use by certain members is more likely than the reintroduction of an international Chinese-language branch. There's a couple of HoloEN members with varying levels of proficiency in certain Sinitic languages for instance: I don't believe she has demonstrated it on stream *as* her Hololive VTuber persona, but >!Kiara does or did at one stage have some degree of Mandarin proficiency!<; the specific incident giving it away was scrubbed but >!Bae speaks Cantonese with Mama Rat!<.

I need this template so much

### 531: [Which movie about World War II do you consider the most realistic?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vc0x8z/which_movie_about_world_war_ii_do_you_consider/), submitted on 2022-06-14 19:01:18+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.

### 532: [Why didn't the USSR annex or put a socialist government in Finland after WW2?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vc2crt/why_didnt_the_ussr_annex_or_put_a_socialist/), submitted on 2022-06-14 20:26:23+08:00.

Hey there,

Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.

If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, [consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) (rather than why what didn't happen didn't happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!

### 533: [What were the diffrences between the Schlieffen Plan and the Blitzkrieg. Which strategy was more effective and why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vc2we6/what_were_the_diffrences_between_the_schlieffen/), submitted on 2022-06-14 20:56:47+08:00.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 534: [What are some of the most influential and secretive US government programs that were uncovered, such as MKULTRA?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vcqfai/what_are_some_of_the_most_influential_and/), submitted on 2022-06-15 17:18:24+08:00.

### 535: [[Tabletop Wargaming] 4Ground fades into the BackGround: The rise and fall of a terrain manufacturer, featuring a Kickstarter disaster, legal shenanigans, and souvenir wooden swords.](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/vcu34h/tabletop_wargaming_4ground_fades_into_the/), submitted on 2022-06-15 21:05:27+08:00.

----- __535.1__ -----2022-06-15 22:54:54+08:00:

Is there a specific context in which that appeared? As in they openly stated they wouldn't bring up 4Ground again?

----- __535.2__ -----2022-06-15 22:55:18+08:00:

No problem! For my part I've only ever backed one Kickstarter campaign (also for a tabletop wargame project), but while that overran it did deliver.

Not all, but a good few (smile)
