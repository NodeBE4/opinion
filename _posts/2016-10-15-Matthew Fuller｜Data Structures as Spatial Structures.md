  he question of the way in which computational networks fold into urban space is often discussed in terms of data – lots of it – and algorithms – that are all powerful! I want to complement these figures by also looking at the way in which a third term, that of data-structures, can be said to merge with, redistribute, correlate with and arrange space and the perceptual, political and aesthetic dimensions that go with them. Such data structures might be complexly encoded locations, such as those of GPS, or categorical, such as classes of entity. Equally, drawing on the work of Georges Perec and others, we might think of urban, domestic and rural forms of space as presenting ‘ready-made’ kinds of spatial data-structure that perplex encoding, or too readily and too abundantly present possibilities for it. Topological modes of description offer a way in which such structures can be explored and established and this paper will make some initial suggestions on these lines.
