Submission Statement:

Territorial and maritime geostrategic frameworks define the contest for power in Europe.  Ukraine is caught between both. Russia is a territorial power, primarily.  The northern European plain lacks natural barriers to invasion, but create opportunities for both client and buffer states, each that could channel risks of invasion.  For Russia, establishing and/or maintaining client states --- particularly along the Northern European Plain, and possibly from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea --- are strategic imperatives to maintain the balance of power.  NATO has maritime superiority.  The Baltic Sea and Black Sea could likewise be springboards for both commerce and supporting military engagements, whether offensive or defensive.   For NATO, both are extensions of the northern Atlantic ocean.  

Buffer states between Europe's adverse power centers mediate that contest --- and by so doing, mitigate the risk of "showdown" wars.   Particularly where the three Baltic states are NATO members, from Moscow's perspective, Ukraine is part of Russia's "near abroad" and should remain within its exclusive sphere of influence (or ideally be re-incorporated into the Russian empire).  Yet, Washington has flirted with the idea of Ukraine's membership in NATO since it gained independence and even more so after the USSR's collapse.  This ostensible "strategic ambiguity" has created the worst possible outcome in Ukraine: inviting a Russian military response under circumstances where Ukraine has failed to develop a robust military of its own and where Washington failed to live up to implied obligations under the Budapest Memorandum in 1994 (along with the other signatories).  When hostilities end, Ukraine will either be annexed by Russia or become aligned more closely with NATO.  In either world, competition for power on the European continent will become more precarious: concurrently defined by a lack of neutral buffers between NATO and Russia and with greater risk of a showdown war between them.
