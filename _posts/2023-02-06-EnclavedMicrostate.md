> "But wouldn't Mandarin be better for work?"

I mean the key thing to remember is that the standardisation of Chinese around Mandarin is a north-Chinese, Han-centric hegemonic initiative to destroy regional distinctiveness in pursuit of a singular national homogeny in an attempt to sustain the necrotic remnants of Manchu dynastic imperialism.

/s but also not really

Honestly I'm surprised the comparison is to r/scp and not r/AskHistorians...

> even if I think people overstate it by indicating it was a veiled slur.

So you can make the case that it's *theoretically* not. In the Wade-Giles Romanisation of Mandairn, 'Chang Cho' corresponds to Pinyin 'Zhang Zhuo', and there *are* people today named that (typically 張卓/张卓).

However, I am sceptical that Rowling was looking meaningfully at Mandarin names, or at their context, because if she had then she'd have been aware that bisyllabic given names are much more common. Moreover, the fact that 'Cho Chang' is *a* plausible name is not the same as saying it is the *only* plausible name that could have been chosen, and it's the nature of that choice, not the plausibility of the outcome, that is being contended over. I can't speculate over Rowling's intentions because I'm not inside her brain, but I'll certainly grant that 'Cho Chang' is, at the *very least*, distinctly 'generic Asian'-sounding and at worst infantilisingly racist, even if Rowling wasn't consciously evoking the particular slur being discussed.

By way of clumsy and, I will fully admit, not particularly comparable analogy, it'd be like me naming a German character 'Adolf Goering' and saying 'well Adolf is a real name, and there are still Goerings about, which means the name is plausible and there is no specific intention behind me choosing that particular first name and surname combination.' Or, more frivolously, if I named a character 'Gaylord Cockburn' you would imagine some kind of intentionality to it. That's how I see 'Cho Chang'.

It absolutely doesn't help that to Chinese cultural elites, non-Mandarin languages are essentially branded as 'lesser', or as relics to be consigned to the dustbin of linguistic extinction.

We are famously draconian.

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.

Muskets rather than rifles, one would have thought.
