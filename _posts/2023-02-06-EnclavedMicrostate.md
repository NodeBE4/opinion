> "But wouldn't Mandarin be better for work?"

I mean the key thing to remember is that the standardisation of Chinese around Mandarin is a north-Chinese, Han-centric hegemonic initiative to destroy regional distinctiveness in pursuit of a singular national homogeny in an attempt to sustain the necrotic remnants of Manchu dynastic imperialism.

> even if I think people overstate it by indicating it was a veiled slur.

So you can make the case that it's *theoretically* not. In the Wade-Giles Romanisation of Mandairn, 'Chang Cho' corresponds to Pinyin 'Zhang Zhuo', and there *are* people today named that (typically 張卓/张卓).

However, I am sceptical that Rowling was looking meaningfully at Mandarin names, or at their context, because if she had then she'd have been aware that bisyllabic given names are much more common. Moreover, the fact that 'Cho Chang' is *a* plausible name is not the same as saying it is the *only* plausible name that could have been chosen, and it's the nature of that choice, not the plausibility of the outcome, that is being contended over. I can't speculate over Rowling's intentions because I'm not inside her brain, but I'll certainly grant that 'Cho Chang' is, at the *very least*, distinctly 'generic Asian'-sounding and at worst infantilisingly racist, even if Rowling wasn't consciously evoking the particular slur being discussed.

By way of clumsy and, I will fully admit, not particularly comparable analogy, it'd be like me naming a German character 'Adolf Goering' and saying 'well Adolf is a real name, and there are still Goerings about, which means the name is plausible and there is no specific intention behind me choosing that particular first name and surname combination.' Or, more frivolously, if I named a character 'Gaylord Cockburn' you would imagine some kind of intentionality to it. That's how I see 'Cho Chang'.

It absolutely doesn't help that to Chinese cultural elites, non-Mandarin languages are essentially branded as 'lesser', or as relics to be consigned to the dustbin of linguistic extinction.

### 1095: [In large parts of Chinese history, China has been united but then it falls and fractures again. So were the several rises and falls of disparate Chinese dynasties one continuous state evolution or can they be treated as rise of different empires just happening to lie in the same geographical region?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10wj2lk/in_large_parts_of_chinese_history_china_has_been/), submitted on 2023-02-08 09:12:21+08:00.

So, there are any number of perspectives on this, but to lay out my *own* position, informed by my familiarity primarily with Qing scholarship, it is better to conceive of imperial China as comprising a contiguous set of political traditions claimed by a variety of non-consecutive states, rather than as a singular polity whose mantle passed between ruling families.

The first and most obvious case to consider is, what happens when there is more than one empire at the same time? Because to be quite frank, there has almost never been a Chinese empire where power simply passed from one ruling house to another at the top. 'Civil' wars, or perhaps more accurately wars of imperial competition, were the norm rather than the exception; virtually never was there a peaceful transition of power between dynastic houses, with perhaps the only notable exception being the Sima clan's usurpation of the state of Wei from the Cao family to found the state of Jin in 265 CE; even that was, however, effectively a bloodless coup coming at the tail end of a major civil war within Wei. Even seemingly 'clean' transitions involved the foundation of a new state outright, but new states didn't necessarily emerge with ambitions of assuming hegemonic status. For instance, the state of Latter Jin was founded in 1618 and refounded as the Great Qing in 1636, but we don't really know exactly when it began seriously intending to conquer the lands of the Ming Empire. For its part, the Ming Empire never assumed the full territorial scope of the Yuan, which in any event *did not simply end in 1368*. The Northern Yuan continued, albeit in an increasingly ceremonial capacity, until the surrender of Lighdan Khan to the Jurchens in 1634.

To give an example of how empires overlapped temporally, the Qing conquest of the former Ming Empire actually serves as quite a good example. The Great Qing was, as noted above, founded in 1636. But at this juncture it only ruled over Manchuria, and not China proper. Its first permanent control of China proper came in 1644, when a rebel army besieged and captured Beijing, leading in turn to Qing forces being invited into China by Ming a frontier general, Wu Sangui, who defected to the Manchus. But if 1644 did not mark the beginning of the Qing Empire itself, neither did it mark the start of total Qing control of China: the completion of conquest was still more than a decade away. Nor did it mark the end of the Ming Empire, as branch lines of the Zhu clan declared a continued Ming Empire in southern China. The Qing would not stamp these remnants out in continental Asia until 1662, but that same year loyalist elements expelled the Dutch from Taiwan, leaving a Ming remnant across the strait. Formal control over southern China was delegated to three 'feudatory' states after 1655, but abolished in 1681 the wake of a revolt by these feudatories in the 1670s. Not until 1683 would the Ming loyalist remnants on Taiwan be stamped out. 

So, if we were to use the 'continuous empire' model, at which of these junctures do we consider the Ming to have ended and the Qing to have begun?

* 1636? But the Qing had yet to conquer *any* of China, which was still in Ming hands, however tenuously.
* 1644? But there was still a Ming emperor (well, at least three competing ones) ruling over territory the Qing didn't yet control. Moreover, there was the rival Shun Empire, founded by the rebels who had dethroned the core Ming line that year.
* 1662? But the Qing had yet to administratively integrate the south, nor deal with the last Ming remnants.
* 1683? But this is just the reverse of the 1636 case – the Ming remnants on Taiwan hadn't meaningfully contested Qing rule over China anyway.

The answer is that it is a trick question. We should not use the 'continuous empire' model. That being said, imperial transitions still did happen at the *local* level. We *can* give dates for when one region passed from one empire to another. For instance, if you were to visit a museum on Taiwan today, typically Ming reign dates are used up to the Qing conquest *of Taiwan* in 1683, rather than switching over in 1644 per the traditional, arbitrary chronology which uses the capture of Beijing as the transitional point. As far as the modern Taiwanese are concerned, the Ming-Qing transition, in chronological terms, is marked in terms of a *local* transition of power, not an abstract shift in the rulership of 'China'. And how would we speak of regions that were not consistently part of a 'canonical' empire? Is the history of Xinjiang part of Chinese history in general, or just between 60-220, 640-763, and from 1757 onward? Is the history of Yunnan 'Chinese' history, or only after 1253?

The 'continuous empire' model breaks down further in scenarios where the 'new' state didn't actually manage to fully 'unite' China, however defined. We have seen how the Ming didn't actually conquer the Yuan outright, just displace it from China proper. But going back in time, the Song Empire, which united most of China by 960, failed to conquer what are now Hebei and Liaodong from the Khitan-ruled Great Liao, but despite the relatively limited territory the Liao held, this was enough to be a substantial hamper to Song prestige claims. This was further compounded when the Jurchen-ruled Jin state defeated the Liao and then conquered China up to the Huai River. So, who is 'China' in this instance? Classically, the traditional timeline of succession regards the Song as the legitimate successor to the Tang and completely sidelines the Liao and Jin, but that designation is completely arbitrary.

But not only did these periods represent a time of political division, there's also a strong case to be made that prolonged non-Han rule in the north was beginning to cause an ethnographic divide. The Song, Liao, and Jin all had somewhat different language to describe their own Sinitic subjects versus those in their rival state, and this administrative division may – though we do not know with certainty – have had effects on self-identification. This division continued under the Yuan, who designated people as *Hanren* or *Songren* depending on whether they or their male-line ancestors were subjects of the Jin or the Song at the time of conquest. Had the eventual Red Turban revolt that established the Ming failed to push far enough north, or had the emperor they installed been less totalising in his intent to 'de-Mongolify' China following his victory, we may well have ended up with a permanent bifurcation of the Han Chinese into two separate population groups, which may conceivably have ended up with divergent histories of statehood. The assertion of Song legitimacy is one that really only makes sense from the retrospective view of the unified rule of China by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Empires, and the consolidation of China proper as both a geographical and a demographic space under the latter two empires.

Even then, relics of that political division survive in modern English. The term 'Cathay', which derives from 'Khitai', originally referred specifically to *northern* China, i.e. the former Jin lands, while 'China', coined by Marco Polo, referred solely to the south that had been ruled by the Song. While near-synonymous today, there was nevertheless a time when European outsiders, based on accurate information about China's administration under the Yuan, regarded the north-south division as a natural one, temporarily bridged by Mongolian imperialism. Such north-south divides threatened to recur afterward, especially under the Qing: the Three Feudatories revolt of the 1670s, the Taiping War in the 1850s-60s, and the 1911 Revolution, all threatened to once again split China between a Han-ruled south and a non-Han-ruled north, should neither side have succeeded in achieving total victory.

Finally we just need to talk about the nomenclature here. There is no Chinese word that maps onto the same variety of meanings encompassed by the English word 'China'; or, to put it another way, the English word 'China' is used to encompass a variety of meanings that exist as individual terms in Chinese, if they even do at all. Paradoxically, this flexibility is at times deliberately reabsorbed and appropriated by the more nationalistic strand of Chinese historians to argue that if a particular empire had *a* concept of a 'China' in some way, that it must therefore have been the *same* concept of China as used today. But even the term *Zhongguo* 中國, the closest analogue to 'China' that exists in Chinese, has had a variety of meanings over time. When first coined in the Warring States period, it was a plural meaning 'the central state**s**' that referred to the collective of the states that nominally recognised Zhou hegemony, or it was used in the singular to refer specifically to the Zhou as the nominal hegemon. Sometimes it was used to refer to a space defined by cultural cachet, at others to state boundaries. The Ming would use *Zhongguo* to denote a geographical region that we might term 'China proper', while excluding their outer imperial holdings, but the Qing used it more generally to refer to all of the territory under their rule. These are all different uses of the term *Zhongguo*, and its reuse over time is not in itself fundamentally convincing as to state continuity, especially when not all states agreed on what territory the term encompassed. Indeed, one thing to note is that the use of *Zhongguo* to describe the whole territory of a state may well be a Manchu calque: *dulimba-i gurun*, 'central polity', is a term with distinct Khitan and Jurchen precedents, and may have influenced *Zhongguo* rather than the other way around. Moreover, that these states did *not* simply reuse a shared term for their own territorial scope is indicative of the genuine notion that these were different empires. Empires with some shared political traditions, and overlapping territory, but nevertheless different.

If you want a perspective from someone with a bit more scholarly training and expertise, I'd recommend a read of [this 2008 open-access article by Peter Perdue](https://worldhistoryconnected.press.uillinois.edu/5.2/perdue.html), who covers many of the issues I do here but with a great deal more eloquence and concision. Nevertheless I hope the above has been at least decently thought-provoking.
