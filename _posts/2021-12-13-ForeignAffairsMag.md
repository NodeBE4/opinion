### 63: [America’s Cyber-Reckoning: How to Fix a Failing Strategy](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rga607/americas_cyberreckoning_how_to_fix_a_failing/), submitted on 2021-12-14 23:40:55+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Sue Gordon, Senior Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Eric Rosenbach, Co-Director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\]  
"U.S. adversaries have honed their cyber-skills to inflict damage on U.S. national security, the American economy, and, most worrisome of all, American democracy. Meanwhile, Washington has struggled to move past its initial perception of the problem, clinging to outmoded ideas that have limited its responses. The United States has also demonstrated an unwillingness to consistently confront its adversaries in the cyber-realm and has suffered from serious self-inflicted wounds that have left it in a poor position to advance its national interests in cyberspace.  
To do better, the United States must focus on the most pernicious threats of all: cyberattacks aimed at weakening societal trust, the underpinnings of democracy, and the functioning of a globalized economy. The Biden administration seems to recognize the need for a new approach. But to make significant progress, it will need to reform the country’s cyberstrategy, starting with its most fundamental aspect: the way Washington understands the problem."

\[SS from the article by Diane Coyle Professor of Public Policy at the University of Cambridge\]

"The movement toward ESG reporting certainly highlights important issues, such as climate change and the treatment of workers, and it is welcome that corporations want to engage in the debate. But the belief that companies can solve such pressing issues—through pursuing ESG standards or otherwise—is deeply flawed. Despite purportedly having good intentions, many corporations are not genuinely interested in bettering the world, and some use ESG metrics or other sustainability measures mainly to launder their reputations. Fixing some of the world’s most vexing problems will require that businesses dramatically alter their own practices, and it makes little sense to entrust systemic reform to the very institutions that themselves require change."

### 65: [A World Without Trust: The Insidious Cyberthreat](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/riigwt/a_world_without_trust_the_insidious_cyberthreat/), submitted on 2021-12-17 22:21:54+08:00.

----- __65.1__ -----2021-12-17 22:22:11+08:00:

\[SS from the article by Jacquelyn Schneider, Hoover Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University\]  
“The United States has not so far experienced a “cyber 9/11,” and a cyberattack that causes immediate catastrophic physical effects isn’t likely in the future, either. But Americans’ trust in their government, their institutions, and even their fellow citizens is declining rapidly—weakening the very foundations of society. Cyberattacks prey on these weak points, sowing distrust in information, creating confusion and anxiety, and exacerbating hatred and misinformation. As people’s digital dependencies grow and the links among technologies, people, and institutions become more tenuous, this cyberthreat to trust will only become more existential. It is this creeping dystopian future that policymakers should worry about—and do everything possible to avert.”

### 66: [The Tattered Dream of a New Kashmir: Modi Promised Great Change But Has Only Stoked Strife](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rikt5m/the_tattered_dream_of_a_new_kashmir_modi_promised/), submitted on 2021-12-18 00:14:08+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Fahad Shah, Editor in Chief of The Kashmir Walla\]  
“Modi and his political party have long wanted to integrate Kashmir more firmly into India. But since he came to power in 2014, India itself has changed. Under Modi, the country has become less welcoming of religious difference, less committed to its founding ideals of pluralism and secularism, and increasingly intolerant of those unwilling to accept India as a Hindu nation—and not a pluralist one.

  
The peace and stability that Modi and his lieutenants promised Kashmir remain a distant prospect. The coming years will probably see Kashmiris grow even more alienated from India. India’s relationship with its neighbor and frequent foe Pakistan—another party to the Kashmir conflict—has become more strained in the past two years. In this context and in the absence of meaningful, peaceful engagement between Kashmiris and the Indian government, there will only be more violence.”
