My politics are defined by a libertarian value structure.  Limiting the state's power in particular and centralized power in general is the position from which I begin nearly all issues.  

I believe in God, and I think most people use politics in place of religion.  Modernism in political thought replaced God with government, ideology and weakness.  In so doing, the society's descent into derisive quasi-religious acrimony and conflict was inevitable.  Russian nihilism figured this out a few centuries beforehand.  Without an external point of reference to make sense of the world, people struggle [to find the means to meaning on their own](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2724&context=dlj).  

I do not recognize the legitimacy of either the Republican or Democrat parties.  I am also skeptical of people who have very long lists of big words with ambiguous, shifting meanings to describe their ostensible political ideology or inclinations.  For example, I doubt an anarcho-feminist postmodern transhumanist could even coherently explain what they think they stand for.
