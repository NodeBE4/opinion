### 353: [What would your 15 year old self think about the life you are living now?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wlshrl/what_would_your_15_year_old_self_think_about_the/), submitted on 2022-08-11 22:16:50+08:00.

"Wait, what did you even do?  What the heck is a [big math words] anyway?  And how does it relate to [big science words]?  And how in the actual fuck did you get a job in biopharma doing it?  And it paid how much?  And you are doing what now?"

15 year old me would be shocked to learn I've had a couple of long-term relationships, two of which were serious and one of which was very serious.  He'd be shocked to know what I looked like in college.  And he'd be surprised how much I look like my father, when my father was in the military. 

About the only thing that wouldn't surprise him is that I am an even more unrelenting Libertarian now than I was when I just wanted to be able to legally smoke weed and drink without the state telling me I couldn't at that age (for alcohol) or at all (for drugs of any kind).
