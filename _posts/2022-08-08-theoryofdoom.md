### 355: [What would your 15 year old self think about the life you are living now?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wlshrl/what_would_your_15_year_old_self_think_about_the/), submitted on 2022-08-11 22:16:50+08:00.

"Wait, what did you even do?  What the heck is a [big math words] anyway?  And how does it relate to [big science words]?  And how in the actual fuck did you get a job in biopharma doing it?  And it paid how much?  And you are doing what now?"

15 year old me would be shocked to learn I've had a couple of long-term relationships, two of which were serious and one of which was very serious.  He'd be shocked to know what I looked like in college.  And he'd be surprised how much I look like my father, when my father was in the military. 

About the only thing that wouldn't surprise him is that I am an even more unrelenting Libertarian now than I was when I just wanted to be able to legally smoke weed and drink without the state telling me I couldn't at that age (for alcohol) or at all (for drugs of any kind).

Not Windows 11.

### 357: [Woman pepper sprays a guy threatening her with a knife](https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/wnbhyq/woman_pepper_sprays_a_guy_threatening_her_with_a/), submitted on 2022-08-13 18:39:37+08:00.

Written statutes weren't stopping people who were not the cops from going in and dealing with that situation.  Cops were.  The same cowards who let this unfold for almost an hour while they sat outside and waited.  Protecting and serving the donuts they brought to the site.

I don't know what you mean by "root" of "this problem," but I also don't care.

There's the criminal, who created this situation.  And the cops, who sat outside like potted plants while kids were being murdered in cold blood by a psychopath.  

Speculate about abstractions to your heart's content.  Go over to /r/iamverysmart for that discussion.  

This is about right and wrong.  My focus is on the people who failed to act, despite it being their responsibility to act.

NOTE:  I am aware cops have no legal duty to rescue.  So don't bother.  That is not the point I am making and I'm not going to debate legal responsibility on reddit with internet lawyers.

### 358: [Hugh Laurie on Blackadder was hilarious (before he was House)](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/wnfsif/hugh_laurie_on_blackadder_was_hilarious_before_he/), submitted on 2022-08-13 22:27:31+08:00.

----- __358.1__ -----2022-08-15 12:59:51+08:00:

He totally is.  The Dave Matthews episode of House, among many others, gave him the chance to showcase it too.

### 359: [Should we ban dihydrogen monoxide from contaminating our waters?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/wo8dp9/should_we_ban_dihydrogen_monoxide_from/), submitted on 2022-08-14 23:00:36+08:00.

Only dioxygen is more addictive.
