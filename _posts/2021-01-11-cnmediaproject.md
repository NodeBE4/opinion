Re But the full phrase here, appearing also in a commentary below it, seems to be "the building of an even closer China-Africa Community of Common Destiny" (构建更加紧密的中非命运共同体). <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-01/11/nw.D110000renmrb_20210111_3-03.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-01/11/nw.D110000renmrb_20210111_3-03.htm</a>

Re "Shared future" is China's preferred official translation of 命运共同体, avoiding the notion of "destiny" (命运) and its suggestion of inevitability. However, the sense of "destiny" is a better reflection of the intent in the original.

Aficionados of Chinese political discourse can seek comic relief today in this not-at-all-tongue-in-cheek exposition of the phrase "effectively implement" (有效落实), by the top CCP leader in Jinan. <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-01/11/nw.D110000renmrb_20210111_2-05.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-01/11/nw.D110000renmrb_20210111_2-05.htm</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErcPP7CXEAIfCbL?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Choice phrase, of unsurpassed profundity: "Effective implementation means 'full implementation,' not 'selective implementation'."
