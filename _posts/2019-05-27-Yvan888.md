### 259: [No way Huawei! Flagship P30 value crashed to $130 from Retail $1,150](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/btc57g/no_way_huawei_flagship_p30_value_crashed_to_130/), submitted on 2019-05-27 03:36:23+08:00.

If it's true, is it a good idea to purchase P30 oversea and sell back to China? Cuz China doesn't have any Google service and has a strong nationalism, P30's price is high and we can make money... ^(Just say)

### 260: [Why China’s youth don’t talk about Tiananmen](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/buad9x/why_chinas_youth_dont_talk_about_tiananmen/), submitted on 2019-05-29 12:43:21+08:00.

tbh based on my *personal* experience, some of them probably just don't want to talk with you and use *parent* as excuse to end the topic quickly 

There are lots of Chinese teens love politics, but probably in another field (I don't know whether you can get it... anyway)

### 261: [Americanized Chinese Food (such as Panda Express) has been very popular in the US. What would the opposite, Chinafied “American” Food look like?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bv82q2/americanized_chinese_food_such_as_panda_express/), submitted on 2019-05-31 22:17:46+08:00.

----- __261.1__ -----2019-06-01 08:02:25+08:00:

tbh what's the local American food?

I know that the menu of **KFC/McDonald** in China is much fancier. You can even [order porridge, rice, and soup in KFC](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kfc-china-smiling-meatball_n_2066803).  [Google image search](https://www.google.com/search?q=kfc+china+menu&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mOPf_MbiAhVOOq0KHTh7BtYQ_AUIECgB&biw=1182&bih=1204)

The **Starbucks** in China provides [Mooncake](http://www.fitacrosscultures.com/deep-dive-into-local-culture/) in Autumn Festival and [Zongzi](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/international-summer-starbucks-menus-offers-dragon-dumplings-banana-frappuccinos) in the Duanwu Festival.

### 262: [Italy is evicting Steve Bannon from the medieval monastery he planned to turn into a far-right training academy](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/bvagoo/italy_is_evicting_steve_bannon_from_the_medieval/), submitted on 2019-06-01 01:33:23+08:00.

----- __262.1__ -----2019-06-01 12:21:19+08:00:

Is that any reliable source that I can bypass the GB and US media to hear the real voice of Europe? Sorry I can only understand English and Chinese

### 263: [What's the difference between Guanxi (China) and Networking (the West)?](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/bvel52/whats_the_difference_between_guanxi_china_and/), submitted on 2019-06-01 07:47:21+08:00.

----- __263.1__ -----2019-06-01 15:44:26+08:00:

so, fraternities and sororities in the west are also more like networking but not guanxi, right?

----- __263.2__ -----2019-06-01 15:54:21+08:00:

Guilt/shame-based culture dimension is a popular model. I think Japan is a perfect example of shame-based culture but China is not that much. The four tracks of Chinese, Confucianism, Legalism, Taoism, and Buddism. The last three are definitely not shame-based culture. The dominant one, Confucianism, is half-and-half IMO.

> human nature is detestable -- by [Xunzi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Xunzi_(book)) one of the three great early architects of Confucian philosophy

PS. Well, I know it's still not the same as the guilt in the west based on Judeo-Christian heritage but neither is shame-based one

Do you think the western study on China focus too much on mianzi and guanxi?

----- __263.3__ -----2019-06-01 16:29:24+08:00:

What about the rich guys send their children to elite colleges by fancy recommendation letters? I don’t think it’s kinda scandal. But it seems to be more like guanxi in this case
