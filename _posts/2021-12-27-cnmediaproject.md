RT Taisu Zhang<br>An obituary that I wrote for Spence (in Chinese—there are surprisingly few of his former students who write in Chinese, even fewer who write to the Mainland audience, so I thought I’d take the plunge on that side of the Pacific).【张泰苏 | 缅怀史景迁老师】 <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5qQv7cfTMqSDO_RFl4T-yQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5qQv7cfTMqSDO_RFl4T-yQ</a>

For the past 4 years the "Four Confidences" formula affirming the strengths of CCP rule has been firmly in place, finally added to the Party Charter in 2017. But the “confidence doctrine" has now been upgraded with a 5th: "historical confidence." <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/12/29/and-then-there-were-five/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/12/29/and-then-there-were-five/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FH0U-IYaUAAV6zP?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
