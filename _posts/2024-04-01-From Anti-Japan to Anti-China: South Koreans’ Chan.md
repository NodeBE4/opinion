拍攝日期：2023/06/01主講人：Prof. Gi-Wook ShinFrom Anti-Japan to Anti-China: South Koreans’ Changing Public Sentiments and Implications for the Indo-Pacific RegionSouth Korean public sentiment towards China has drastically deteriorated over the past few years, becoming even worse than sentiment toward Japan. In this talk, Professor Gi-Wook Shin will illuminate factors that contribute to Koreans’ negative views of China, from resentment towards economic retaliation over THAAD deployment to culture wars over hanbok and kimchi. He will draw comparisons to Koreans’ historically negative sentiments of Japan and anti-American sentiments of past decades, and discuss how these anti-China sentiments may play out in the Yoon Suk-Yeol administration’s policy towards China and the U.S.-ROK alliance. Finally, he will address the implications of Korea’s evolving views of China for the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan.►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
