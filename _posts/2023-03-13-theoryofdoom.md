### 506: [Professors, have you noticed a difference in the abilities of undergraduates post-COVID?](https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11tskm5/professors_have_you_noticed_a_difference_in_the/), submitted on 2023-03-17 22:26:12+08:00.

My old professor friend think the post-pandemic entering classes are the dumbest he's ever taught.  

He's tenured, at a certain school in the North East.

### 507: [Style of Mathematics in Russia before and after formation of the USSR](https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11uj2j1/style_of_mathematics_in_russia_before_and_after/), submitted on 2023-03-18 17:10:10+08:00.

I came here to say this.  Exactly the right answer.

### 508: [Am I a bad person for automatically judging people with HnH or PnP in their profile?](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/11ujnfa/am_i_a_bad_person_for_automatically_judging/), submitted on 2023-03-18 17:44:07+08:00.

----- __508.1__ -----2023-03-19 01:35:04+08:00:

Not really a fun fact.  More like a sad reality of gay men destroying their lives, because they lack the maturity to realize that self discipline is nothing more than empathy with their future self.

### 509: [Im 23 I think I have erectile disfunction](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/11uo4p4/im_23_i_think_i_have_erectile_disfunction/), submitted on 2023-03-18 21:11:28+08:00.

----- __509.1__ -----2023-03-19 01:52:55+08:00:

How much porn do you watch?

### 510: [My Fellow Gaybros: Please be responsible.](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/11uuzqe/my_fellow_gaybros_please_be_responsible/), submitted on 2023-03-19 01:51:46+08:00.

----- __510.1__ -----2023-03-19 02:17:34+08:00:

Actually, my weekend has been great.  

And otherwise, you've got every right to disregard what I said.  Your life is your own responsibility.  Live it however you want.

----- __510.2__ -----2023-03-19 02:19:36+08:00:

> There's more nuance than you're allowing for in your argument.

Of course.  And I would be a complete hypocrite if I said otherwise.
