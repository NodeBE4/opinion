### 411: [Why was Rome chosen as the location for the signing of I) the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) and II) the EEC Treaty (1957)?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ul6ul1/why_was_rome_chosen_as_the_location_for_the/), submitted on 2022-05-09 01:37:19+08:00.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 412: [I need to know the book that was opened by a Japanese women concerning the two bombs dropped on Japan featured in PBS's My Grandfather's War?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ulhop7/i_need_to_know_the_book_that_was_opened_by_a/), submitted on 2022-05-09 10:57:49+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.

Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 413: [Former associates of Trump (e.g. Bolton, Esper) continue to write books about his term that are scathingly critical.

This submission has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or [moralizing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/) it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

### 420: [What was the first account of the Gordians knot?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/umipk2/what_was_the_first_account_of_the_gordians_knot/), submitted on 2022-05-10 21:27:12+08:00.

----- __420.1__ -----2022-05-11 00:13:49+08:00:

With the understanding that it is quite possible that a grasp of the source landscape will be part of the exercise, essay-wise, I think it best for me to keep it relatively short and simple, with a basic overview of Alexander sources and some reading recommendations for a more in-depth look at the problem. The first of these recommendations is Andrea Zambrini's chapter 'The Historians of Alexander the Great', in Volume 1 of John Marincola's *A Companion to Greek and Roman Historiography* (2007), which discusses the early historians of Alexander whose work has been lost; the second is ‪Elizabeth Baynham‬'s 'The Ancient Evidence for Alexander the Great', in Joseph Roisman's *Brill's Companion to Alexander the Great* (2003) (not to be confused with Kenneth Moore's *Brill's Companion to the Reception of Alexander the Great* (2018)), which begins with the lost historians and then goes into the surviving ones.

To give the most general of overviews, there are, in effect, four broad types of Alexander source material:

1. Surviving contemporary evidence such as epigraphy, the Babylonian temple records, and coins;
2. Narrative histories, all surviving examples of which postdate Alexander by at least 250 years;
3. Fragments, or in other words references to and quotations of otherwise-lost sources, typically found in works not specifically about Alexander; and
4. Romances, i.e. largely fictional narratives in which Alexander is treated as a fantastical character.

There are no 'perfect' sources for Alexander by any means, but it is essentially the case that most discussions of Alexander are necessarily framed around the core narrative histories of his reign, the surviving examples of which were largely composed between the second half of the first century BCE, and the first half of the second century CE. These are, in chronological order:

* Book 17 of Diodoros of Sicily's *Library of History*, composed ca. 50-30 BCE;

* Books 10-11 of Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus' *Philippic Histories*, composed ca. 20 BCE-10 CE, but surviving only as a summary by Justin ca. 200 CE;

* Quintus Curtius Rufus' *History of Alexander the Great*, composed ca. 50 CE;

* Plutarch's *Life of Alexander*, composed ca. 110-115 CE; and

* Arrian of Nikomedia's *Anabasis of Alexander*, composed ca. 115-125 CE.

There is also technically a sixth source known as the Metz Epitome although its value is relatively dubious and it is rarely ever brought up. 

There are some relevant non-narrative sources such as Plutarch's essays *On the Fortune or Virtue of Alexander*, Arrian's *Indika*, and a series of fragmentary episodes within Books 15-17 of Strabo's *Geography*, but for the most part we rely on the above five, supplemented by the odd fragment or surviving contemporary source.

The thing that the five core narrative sources have in common is of course their late authorship, but that does not imply an inherent unreliability. All five of these are derived, ultimately, from lost texts authored by what modern historians term the 'first-generation' Alexander historians, of whom Zambrini lists 10: Kallisthenes of Olynthos, Anaximenes of Lampsakos, Nearchos of Crete, Kleitarchos of Alexandria, Ptolemy son of Lagos, Aristoboulos of Kassandreia, Chares of Mytilene, Ephippos of Olynthos, Polykleitos of Larissa, and Medeios of Larissa. This isn't even the full list – for instance, it doesn't include Onesikritos of Astypalaia, who was one of the main sources on Alexander's Indian campaigns.

The notion that more temporally proximate sources are necessarily more reliable is not a particularly sensible one, but it must be defenestrated with especial vigour in the case of Alexander thanks to the simple absence of the original 'first-generation' material. What we are dealing with are, for the most part, secondary sources written by historians with their own individual methodologies, influencing how the information in those lost sources has been transmitted to us. The various unique combinations of source material and authorial agenda in the corpus means that these surviving historians can vary in usefulness and probable accuracy, not just in terms of the works as a whole but also within the same work – Arrian, for instance, might narrate certain episodes reliably, but be completely off the mark on others.

It does not help, of course, that these works often give contradictory or at least conflicting accounts of the same events when they overlap. Resolving such disputes is the realm of what is termed *Quellenforschung*, literally 'source research' – why and how does a given source say what it does, and with that in mind, how likely is it to be true – or closer to the truth – relative to the other sources on the same thing?

To return to your original question, 'Is Quintus Curtius Rufus really the earliest source to mention the cutting of the Gordian Knot by Alexander the Great?' may be the question you *think* you want to ask, but the question you *actually* want to ask is, 'Where do the surviving sources on the Gordian Knot episode get *their* information from, how and how far do they alter that in the retelling, and how should the specifics of the event be understood in light of those factors?' To help you with that, there are three articles on the topic, given here in chronological order with each building on and responding to the one prior:

* Ernest Fredericksmeyer, 'Alexander, Midas, and the Oracle at Gordium', *Classical Philology* 56:3 (1961)
* Lynn E. Roller, 'Midas and the Gordian Knot', *Classical Antiquity* 3:2 (1984)
* Mark H Munn, 'Alexander, the Gordian Knot, and the Kingship of Midas', in *Macedonian Legacies: Studies in Macedonian History and Culture in Honor of Eugene N. Borza* (2008)
