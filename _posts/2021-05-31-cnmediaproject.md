RT Katrina Yu<br>Following the announcement of #Beijing's new 3-child policy this meme of director Zhang Yimou is doing the rounds on Chinese social media. Translated it says "So can you refund my f*cking 7.48 million CNY?" Zhang was fined more than $1 million in 2014 for having 3 children. lol<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2tQkO2VoAUMPEw?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re This post says that when pigs don't have piglets in the countryside the conventional response is to find out what's wrong in the pig's environment -- and to fix it. Suggesting perhaps the gov't should address other inequities.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2t6pHFWQAQbOom?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
