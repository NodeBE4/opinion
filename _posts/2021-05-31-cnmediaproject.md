Another front-page promotion in today's People's Daily for an "article" by Xi Jinping appearing in the Qiushi journal. This is part of the continuing trend of rerunning Xi speeches in the journal.

Re @adrianzenz @DSORennie ÊääÊè°Â•ΩÂü∫Ë∞É, the "tone" language is not new, and is likely being misread as referring to a strategic external tone change.
