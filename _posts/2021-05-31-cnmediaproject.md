Social media in China brimming with laughter and bitterness today over the 3-child policy. Here's a play on Ê∞ë‰∏çËÅäÁîü, which means "the people have no way of getting by," but in this joke means people don't even want to TALK about having kids.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2t55kZWUAozMze?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Language about self-reliance in science and technology again tops the page at People's Daily Online today.‚ÄÇ<a href="http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2021/0601/c1004-32118607.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2021/0601/c1004-32118607.html</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2xdvlzXMAAws04?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Another front-page promotion in today's People's Daily for an "article" by Xi Jinping appearing in the Qiushi journal. This is part of the continuing trend of rerunning Xi speeches in the journal. Read about it here:‚ÄÇ<a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/01/20/xi-jinping-headline-columnist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/01/20/xi-jinping-headline-columnist/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2xhNNgXMAIj_9K?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Today is International Children's Day. So naturally the People's Daily runs a front-page piece on how great Xi Jinping is with children.‚ÄÇ<a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-06/01/nw.D110000renmrb_20210601_3-01.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2021-06/01/nw.D110000renmrb_20210601_3-01.htm</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2xjOG_WEAMQPZW?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re @ABPevzner Would be interesting to find examples of how that might be happening. So often the opposite seems to be true in practice.
