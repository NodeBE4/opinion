The house in the photo has totally different corners &#8212; the round logs stop short of the corners and only have dovetails that overlap. The style of this log cabin would be Round Log Unchinked with Dovetail Corner Notches. </p><p>Unfortunately, all the new knowledge I discovered about log cabins was absolutely no help in finding the location. So, based on your clue (&#8220;Going into this election, you should know it&#8221;), I&#8217;m going with&nbsp;Dixville&nbsp;Notch, NH. Going into this election, and every presidential election,&nbsp;Dixville&nbsp;Notch (pop. 12) will be the first community to announce its results at 12:01am on Tuesday morning.</p></blockquote><p>From another reader who guessed Dixville&nbsp;Notch:</p><blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a whole range of mountains named after presidents in New Hampshire &#8212; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Range">Presidential Range</a> &#8212; and I&#8217;d bet our view is nestled somewhere among them. The general northeastern locale is confirmed by the New York State plate visible on the car; I&#8217;d know that orange anywhere, and while rental plates confuse matters, it makes a northeastern location more likely.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another reader heads west:</p><blockquote><p>This looks like Humphreys Peak north of&nbsp;Flagstaff, Arizona. I poked around Google Maps a bit, but I couldn&#8217;t make any further progress. I&#8217;m going to guess the view was taken somewhere in the red circle:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-1194-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe25b3cab-a7d0-4c23-8fa9-400df6ed03f1_1678x1376.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe25b3cab-a7d0-4c23-8fa9-400df6ed03f1_1678x1376.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e25b3cab-a7d0-4c23-8fa9-400df6ed03f1_1678x1376.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1194,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4349775,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-1194-1456 {            padding-bottom: 82.0054945054945%;            padding-bottom: min(82.0054945054945%, 1194px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-1194-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 1194px;          }        </style></a><p>Now I am going to enjoy my holiday weekend!</p></blockquote><p>This reader probably enjoyed the weekend on the water:</p><blockquote><p>Well, I&#8217;m a river rafter, with a boat very similar to this. Based on the mountains in the background, I&#8217;m going to say Aspen, Colorado. (Possibly Snowmass &#8230;) The boater probably floats the Roaring Fork River, a sublime stream I have rafted myself many times &#8212; although I live in the only-slightly-less expensive enclave of Boulder. And just for kicks, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a 13&#8217; Aire Wave Destroyer. Nice boat.</p></blockquote><p>Another heads to the West Coast:</p><blockquote><p>The mountains and the watercraft put me somewhere in the west. Your clue makes me think, but not of a prized swing state. Instead I&#8217;m reminded of the consequential developments in Portland and the mark they&#8217;ll leave on this election and beyond. Here in Canada, we&#8217;re hoping for a little less unrest, so wherever this view is &#8212; I&#8217;m gonna say Wallowa County, Oregon &#8212; it seems like a perfect start.</p></blockquote><p>Thankfully that scenic county isn&#8217;t on fire right now. In contrast, a reader in Portland &#8212; where my Airstream happens to be parked right now &#8212; sends this pea-soup view:</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-1094-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F659dd7f9-b631-40a1-bde4-076f6d1716eb_3160x2374.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F659dd7f9-b631-40a1-bde4-076f6d1716eb_3160x2374.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/659dd7f9-b631-40a1-bde4-076f6d1716eb_3160x2374.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1094,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1169052,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>          a.image2.image-link.image2-1094-1456 {            padding-bottom: 75.13736263736264%;            padding-bottom: min(75.13736263736264%, 1094px);            width: 100%;            height: 0;          }          a.image2.image-link.image2-1094-1456 img {            max-width: 1456px;            max-height: 1094px;          }        </style></a><p>That reader adds, &#8220;We have the <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/world-air-quality">worst air quality on Earth right now</a>&#8221; &#8212; <em>double</em> the AQI level of the second worst city, San Francisco. </p><p>Another reader heads to cleaner air north:</p><blockquote><p>License plate looks like it might be&nbsp;Alaska. Somewhere with river rafting. Trees look like a mixture of Douglas fir and deciduous.&nbsp;Tree line is low, so it&#8217;s somewhat north. I&#8217;m guessing somewhere along Hwy 16 in British Columbia, but that might be too far south. Prince Rupert, BC?</p></blockquote><p>Not north enough. Another reader gets to the right state:</p><blockquote><p>Alaska ...... is a very, very large place.&nbsp;Best of luck to those willing to go down that rabbit hole.</p></blockquote><p>A reader in Juneau can see Wasilla from her house:</p><blockquote><p>At first I thought it was Talkeetna, but Todd Palin&#8217;s doghouse gave it away &#8212; it&#8217;s gotta be Sarah Palin&#8217;s house and yard at Lake Lucille, Wasilla,&nbsp;Alaska.</p></blockquote><p>Another reader heads down to the Kenai Peninsula:</p><blockquote><p>It has to be Cooper Landing.&nbsp;I fish in that area all the time, so the mountains are recognizable, and those are definitely&nbsp;Alaskan&nbsp;trees.&nbsp;Google Earth will not be kind to people on this one, as the aerial images are too dark to make out individual structures in detail.&nbsp;So I don&#8217;t know the exact GPS coordinates, but it appears to be taken from inside an RV/trailer, presumably with the world famous Kenai River behind the photographer or somewhere nearby. Am I wrong?</p></blockquote><p>Yep. Another reader goes deep:</p><blockquote><p>Gah &#8212; what an incredibly cryptic photo. I think the only way is to put on my red Where&#8217;s Waldo cap &#8230;</p><ul><li><p>I see just a tiny glimpse of a license plate on the car and I would say it looks yellow and blue.

To my knowledge, it&#8217;s the one minivan with AWD. It&#8217;s an option &#8212; but it&#8217;s possible that&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;Sienna has AWD. Wouldn&#8217;t have AWD if you didn&#8217;t need it, so perhaps that means this is a land of ice and snow.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The relatively bare hills/mountains would also seem to indicate a low-growth environment &#8212; like parts of Alaska. The car has a float boat hooked up (and fishing rods), so we are near calm water. That makes me think this is not at altitude and therefore the hills are quite barren due to higher latitude.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The house feels seasonal. The driveway is relatively even, un-rutted, not much traffic &#8212; and yet it&#8217;s not overgrown with weeds. There&#8217;s not much wood stored under the stairs either, despite being a spot (photo below) looking like it was put in for the purpose.
