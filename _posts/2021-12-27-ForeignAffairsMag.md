### 72: [How to Make COVID-19 Vaccines Available to All: Manufacture the Right Kinds in the Right Places](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/rptv6m/how_to_make_covid19_vaccines_available_to_all/), submitted on 2021-12-28 02:30:23+08:00.

"Omicron’s rapid and sudden emergence highlights the uncertainties in the pandemic’s trajectory. It is possible that the world will need another round of vaccines, further straining supply and encouraging high-income countries to continue stockpiling doses. To prevent such an outcome, wealthy countries, multilateral development banks, and global health agencies will need to expand mRNA manufacturing in regions and countries that have little to no capacity. Doing that would increase overall supply and make it more difficult for a small collection of nations to hoard most doses. It would help distribute mRNA vaccines around the world, lowering prices and making shots more accessible to everyone. And in the long term, more dispersed manufacturing could help countries produce non-COVID-19 inoculations, protecting the world against other diseases—and better preparing it for the next pandemic."

\[SS from the article by Dmitri Trenin, Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center\]

"Putin has presided over four waves of NATO enlargement and has had to accept Washington’s withdrawal from treaties governing anti-ballistic missiles, intermediate-range nuclear forces, and unarmed observation aircraft. For him, Ukraine is the last stand. The Russian commander-in-chief is supported by his security and military establishments and, despite the Russian public’s fear of a war, faces no domestic opposition to his foreign policy. Most importantly, he cannot afford to be seen bluffing. Biden was right not to reject Russia’s demands out of hand and to favor engagement instead."

\[SS from the article by Anand Menon, Director of UK in a Changing Europe and Professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King’s College London.\]  
“A year in, there is growing evidence that Brexit has taken a toll on the British economy, but despite Johnson’s claim, many of its details still need to be determined, and its true costs and benefits remain unknown. The British government has not fully implemented the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement—the rules and terms by which the two sides agreed to talk and trade. That’s partly because COVID-19 has eclipsed the decision to leave the EU in terms of both political salience and economic impact. By delaying full implementation of the deal, the United Kingdom has delayed the consequences of the new trading arrangements.  
But some economic damage has already become clear. According to a study conducted by John Springford, an economics researcher at the Centre for European Reform, British goods trade in September 2021 was 11.2 percent, or 8.5 billion pounds, lower than it would have been had the United Kingdom stayed in the EU’s single market and customs union. And the post-Brexit period is also beginning to have political consequences. There are signs that the pro-Leave coalition that swept Johnson to power in December 2019 just might be less stable than many initially assumed.”
