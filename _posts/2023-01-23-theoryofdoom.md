### 450: [Last week Steven Crowder and Jeremy Boreing gave the world a Masterclass on how NOT to negotiate a multi-million dollar deal. Steven reacted emotionally to lowball offers with onerous terms. Jeremy reacted similarly and escalated an already bad situation.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Deplatformed_/comments/10jgtob/last_week_steven_crowder_and_jeremy_boreing_gave/), submitted on 2023-01-24 00:40:05+08:00.

The OP's [article](https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/the-steven-crowder-the-daily-wire)'s headline is somewhat misleading. 

First, the word "emotional" is meant to manipulate the reader.  That word is used to imply irrationality, without saying "irrational."  And if "irrational" is not what OP meant, I suggest better copy editing.  Crowder wasn't being irrational; the deal the Daily Wire offered was very unsophisticated, incompetently drafted and very heavy handed against the Daily Wire's potentially recruited talent.  

Second, Crowder did not "take . . . public" any contract negotiations.  Crowder unequivocally rejected Boreing's offer and ended their negotiations, without countering.  The negotiation between Crowder and The Daily Wire ended before Crowder started talking about what happened.  

Third, Boreing unilaterally interpreted Crowder's "public" discussion as an effort to continue negotiation by other means.  Boering speculated that Crowder's public comments regarding their negotiations and the terms they were negotiating was an effort to continue negotiation by some other means.  A part of me wonders if Boreing quoted Clausewitz while trying to make sense of the situation.  

Fourth, Boreing revealed the terms proposed by the Daily Wire's standard contract and Crowder did not.  I really don't know what Boreing was thinking.  He is either not even close to as good of a businessman as he thinks he is, or he assumes everyone is just going to hear the amount offered and inquire no further.  But I'm inclined to think Boreing just isn't very good at making sophisticated offers, forecasting value to be added from a deal or even understanding how value in such a deal is added.  I think Boreing just made the best offer the Daily Wire was in a position to convey given their (limited) understanding of valuing future revenue streams from monetizing talent. 

Crowder's point in going public, however, was that Jeremy Boreing and the Daily Wire's standard terms placed Crowder on a leash as long as media platforms' moderation policies.  

And he's right. 

The Daily Wire's terms would have cut Crowder's production budget and considerably financially penalized Crowder's company as a result of something totally beyond his control.  

And that is unconscionable.  

Boreing and the Daily Wire walk away from this looking incompetent.  Not to mention hypocritical.
