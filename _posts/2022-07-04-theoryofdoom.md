### 329: [California Gov. Gavin Newsom Attack Ad on Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheDesantisZone/comments/vqshnc/california_gov_gavin_newsom_attack_ad_on_floridas/), submitted on 2022-07-04 06:14:51+08:00.

In Florida, they believe in the freedom to be able to go to the beach, eat at restaurants and go to work.  

In California, they believe in crackpot pseudoscience and fascism by decree of the same "experts" in that crackpot pseudoscience.

I'll take DeSantis 10/10 times.

### 330: [Bad yet successful books](https://old.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/vr3itl/bad_yet_successful_books/), submitted on 2022-07-04 17:29:19+08:00.

----- __330.1__ -----2022-07-05 01:28:02+08:00:

The Hunger Games.  Terrible book.  Very successful.  Same with the Divergent series.  Bad writing.  Bad plot.  Bad characters.  Bad everything.

> Dollar Store fake Stoicism

That is the perfect description.

### 331: [Police identify 22-year-old suspect wanted after mass shooting leaves 6 dead, 37 injured in Highland Park](https://old.reddit.com/r/crime/comments/vrjq8m/police_identify_22yearold_suspect_wanted_after/), submitted on 2022-07-05 06:59:49+08:00.

----- __331.1__ -----2022-07-05 08:56:38+08:00:

Headline should have read:

"Police identify pathetic incel suspect wanted after . . . . "

----- __331.2__ -----2022-07-05 11:05:50+08:00:

Keep the partisan nonsense out of this sub.

### 332: [Kazakhstan holds the keys to a new geopolitical balance in Asia](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/vro6p0/kazakhstan_holds_the_keys_to_a_new_geopolitical/), submitted on 2022-07-05 11:08:25+08:00.

----- __332.1__ -----2022-07-05 11:18:13+08:00:

Submission Statement: 

This op-ed argues that geopolitical balance in Asia will depend on Central Asia, and specifically Kazakhstan.  Central Asia is and has always been a mediating force between the United States, Europe, Russia and China. Kazakhstan in particular stands to benefit from trade with all, and loss of influence there surely tips the scale in adversaries' favor, in every way that matters: diplomatically, militarily and economically, at the very least.  Accordingly, the United States must meaningfully re-engage without over-reaching; seeking to maintain Kazakhstan's independence from any single great power with interests in the region.

### 333: [The Social Media Mob vs. the Novel](https://old.reddit.com/r/politicalwarfare/comments/vu2ov1/the_social_media_mob_vs_the_novel/), submitted on 2022-07-08 13:03:49+08:00.

----- __333.1__ -----2022-07-08 13:37:31+08:00:

Ardern is a nauseating disgrace to the western world.

### 334: [Unofficial Daily Update for 2022-07-08. 5403 New Cases.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/vugr5g/unofficial_daily_update_for_20220708_5403_new/), submitted on 2022-07-09 02:00:10+08:00.

----- __334.1__ -----2022-07-09 22:34:35+08:00:

Just wild?  Seriously?

### 335: [I had to take a test for HR with our work as they're doing an overhaul on management. I got intj, which is nice as it appears rare but](https://old.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/vvb1qv/i_had_to_take_a_test_for_hr_with_our_work_as/), submitted on 2022-07-10 05:00:24+08:00.

----- __335.1__ -----2022-07-10 07:33:55+08:00:

[Know thyself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0rqoRbzzU&ab_channel=williamtruglio).  Psychometric testing is a means to that end. 

Knowing that you're an INTJ is useful.  I am too.  My e/i ratio used to favor extroversion, but the older I get the more introverted I become.  But as others have said, if your employer is making you take a test wherein you are recorded to determine if you are cheating, it's time to get another job.  That isn't your main question, but it's the most salient thing you're going to take from this thread.

As to accuracy, psychometric testing is controversial.  Some people swear by it.  Others do not.  But it's used by every major organization on earth, because it's useful.  You should spend some time looking at the other MBTI types and the analysis among the psychological literature focusing on how you'll interact with them.  Chances are, it will be an enlightening experience for you.  It certainly has been for me.

### 336: [How is Peter Zeihan considered among geopolitical experts? I've started reading his books and am curious where he falls amongst his peers.](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/vvo3c0/how_is_peter_zeihan_considered_among_geopolitical/), submitted on 2022-07-10 17:45:43+08:00.
