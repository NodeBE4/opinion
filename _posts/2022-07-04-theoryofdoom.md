### 327: [California Gov. Gavin Newsom Attack Ad on Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheDesantisZone/comments/vqshnc/california_gov_gavin_newsom_attack_ad_on_floridas/), submitted on 2022-07-04 06:14:51+08:00.

In Florida, they believe in the freedom to be able to go to the beach, eat at restaurants and go to work.  

In California, they believe in crackpot pseudoscience and fascism by decree of the same "experts" in that crackpot pseudoscience.

I'll take DeSantis 10/10 times.

### 328: [Bad yet successful books](https://old.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/vr3itl/bad_yet_successful_books/), submitted on 2022-07-04 17:29:19+08:00.

The Hunger Games.  Terrible book.  Very successful.  Same with the Divergent series.  Bad writing.  Bad plot.  Bad characters.  Bad everything.

> Dollar Store fake Stoicism

That is the perfect description.

### 329: [Police identify 22-year-old suspect wanted after mass shooting leaves 6 dead, 37 injured in Highland Park](https://old.reddit.com/r/crime/comments/vrjq8m/police_identify_22yearold_suspect_wanted_after/), submitted on 2022-07-05 06:59:49+08:00.

Headline should have read:

"Police identify pathetic incel suspect wanted after . . . . "
