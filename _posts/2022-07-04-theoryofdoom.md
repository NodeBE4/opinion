### 327: [California Gov. Gavin Newsom Attack Ad on Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheDesantisZone/comments/vqshnc/california_gov_gavin_newsom_attack_ad_on_floridas/), submitted on 2022-07-04 06:14:51+08:00.

In Florida, they believe in the freedom to be able to go to the beach, eat at restaurants and go to work.  

In California, they believe in crackpot pseudoscience and fascism by decree of the same "experts" in that crackpot pseudoscience.

I'll take DeSantis 10/10 times.
