### 655: [Trying out this system for the first time](https://old.reddit.com/r/wargaming/comments/wcwuq3/trying_out_this_system_for_the_first_time/), submitted on 2022-08-01 03:33:10+08:00.

Nice! I've played a test game with some Brigade Models Aeronef/Imperial Skies models and also managed to port it to TTS. I'm curious what you think of it – I feel like the rules are solid, but the fleet lists are horrifically poorly balanced points-wise.

### 656: [Why are some French/German/English names "Hungarianized", like King Lois becoming King Lajos in Hungarian?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wd3puv/why_are_some_frenchgermanenglish_names/), submitted on 2022-08-01 08:43:10+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 657: [When does ideology and culture intersect with strategy?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wd48qb/when_does_ideology_and_culture_intersect_with/), submitted on 2022-08-01 09:08:00+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it involves current events.  To keep from discussion of politics, we have a [20-year rule](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events) here.  You may want to try /r/ask_politics, /r/NeutralPolitics, or another current-events focused sub. For further explanation of this rule, feel free to consult [this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glj8c4/rules_roundtable_xii_the_twenty_year_rule/).
