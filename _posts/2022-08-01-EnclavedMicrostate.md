### 656: [Trying out this system for the first time](https://old.reddit.com/r/wargaming/comments/wcwuq3/trying_out_this_system_for_the_first_time/), submitted on 2022-08-01 03:33:10+08:00.

Nice! I've played a test game with some Brigade Models Aeronef/Imperial Skies models and also managed to port it to TTS. I'm curious what you think of it – I feel like the rules are solid, but the fleet lists are horrifically poorly balanced points-wise.

----- __656.2__ -----2022-08-02 09:02:20+08:00:

What in particular about the damage mechanics?

----- __656.3__ -----2022-08-02 13:23:44+08:00:

I don’t believe that’s correct. The table says to subtract one ‘if firing ship has a Friction marker’, not that you subtract one *per* Friction marker. So while having Friction somewhat reduces firepower, it normally shouldn’t cancel it outright.

EDIT: also to check, are you removing the total _number_ on the dice, or the total _passes_? I believe it should be the former.

### 657: [Why are some French/German/English names "Hungarianized", like King Lois becoming King Lajos in Hungarian?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wd3puv/why_are_some_frenchgermanenglish_names/), submitted on 2022-08-01 08:43:10+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 660: [kneel before Laplus](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/wdgdfr/kneel_before_laplus/), submitted on 2022-08-01 20:34:05+08:00.

HK Exhibition Centre, looks like it was taken at Ani-Com today.

### 661: [Why is the Enterprise the only ship with registry repetition?](https://old.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/wdz2d9/why_is_the_enterprise_the_only_ship_with_registry/), submitted on 2022-08-02 09:55:56+08:00.

----- __661.1__ -----2022-08-02 18:26:46+08:00:

I forget if Voyager-J gets specifically named as such, but during the finale arc of S3 Admiral Vance does definitely order it around a bit.

### 662: [Would the Japanese have surrendered to the Soviets if the Americans hadn’t nukes Hiroshima and Nagasaki?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/we634h/would_the_japanese_have_surrendered_to_the/), submitted on 2022-08-02 16:21:59+08:00.

### 663: [ELI5: How did the U.S. rise to a global superpower in only 250 years but counties that have been around for 1000s of years are still under-developed?](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/we7chi/eli5_how_did_the_us_rise_to_a_global_superpower/), submitted on 2022-08-02 17:41:26+08:00.

----- __663.1__ -----2022-08-02 22:48:04+08:00:

'Countries' don't really exist on the scale of hundreds of years,. 'China' in its modern form has only existed as far back as 1949 for instance (and whether you count that depends on whether you consider major changes after Mao's death as substantive enough to count). Just because a country *says* it's old doesn't mean it *is*.

### 664: [Marine senchou's birthday celebration advertisement in Hong Kong situated at a... fitting location](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/we9xn6/marine_senchous_birthday_celebration/), submitted on 2022-08-02 20:05:21+08:00.

----- __664.1__ -----2022-08-03 11:11:49+08:00:

It's next to a very busy pedestrian overpass.

EDIT: Also (because I can't believe I forgot this detail) there's a good chance you'd pass by it while going to or leaving the Convention and Exhibition Centre, which you might do if you were at, say, Ani-Com, which ran there from last Friday until this Tuesday.

### 665: [Does Scepticism of China really mirror Anti Japanese Sentiment of the Past?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wefc37/does_scepticism_of_china_really_mirror_anti/), submitted on 2022-08-02 23:55:31+08:00.

### 666: [2d vs 3d](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/wev4ae/2d_vs_3d/), submitted on 2022-08-03 11:01:01+08:00.

----- __666.1__ -----2022-08-04 12:47:32+08:00:

> I think Miko has even mentioned she doesn't have a 2D model for her more recent outfits because she's been using her 3D only for a long time.

Miko, Sora, and Roboco are the only three Holomems who debuted as 3D and have never had Live2D models. Sora and Roboco were originally supposed to be part of the Hololive AR app that wouldn't have supported Live2D, while Miko was a separate Cover project to Hololive when she first debuted.

### 667: [Ex Rugby Star Dies in Italy After Suffering Heart Attack While Brutally 'Beating Up Girlfriend' in Coke-Fuelled Attack](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/wfw49x/ex_rugby_star_dies_in_italy_after_suffering_heart/), submitted on 2022-08-04 16:50:58+08:00.

So. A best outcome then.

### 668: [Why were the Boxers unable to defeat heavily-outnumbered, surrounded Westerners in the Beijing Legation Quarter?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wg4de0/why_were_the_boxers_unable_to_defeat/), submitted on 2022-08-04 23:39:27+08:00.

----- __668.1__ -----2022-08-05 01:26:33+08:00:

More can of course be said, especially by someone who has read up on the Boxers in more detail more recently and can thus remember the details better, but as I note in passing in [this past answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q9pvuv/why_did_the_qing_government_support_the_boxers/hgysbu9/), the siege of the Legations was primarily an effort of the Qing regular army overseen by Ronglu, who was an anti-Boxer with reformist sentiments and seems to have been reluctant to prosecute the siege to the fullest extent.
