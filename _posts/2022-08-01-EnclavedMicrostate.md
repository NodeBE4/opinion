### 656: [Trying out this system for the first time](https://old.reddit.com/r/wargaming/comments/wcwuq3/trying_out_this_system_for_the_first_time/), submitted on 2022-08-01 03:33:10+08:00.

Nice! I've played a test game with some Brigade Models Aeronef/Imperial Skies models and also managed to port it to TTS. I'm curious what you think of it – I feel like the rules are solid, but the fleet lists are horrifically poorly balanced points-wise.

----- __656.2__ -----2022-08-02 09:02:20+08:00:

What in particular about the damage mechanics?

----- __656.3__ -----2022-08-02 13:23:44+08:00:

I don’t believe that’s correct. The table says to subtract one ‘if firing ship has a Friction marker’, not that you subtract one *per* Friction marker. So while having Friction somewhat reduces firepower, it normally shouldn’t cancel it outright.

EDIT: also to check, are you removing the total _number_ on the dice, or the total _passes_? I believe it should be the former.

### 657: [Why are some French/German/English names "Hungarianized", like King Lois becoming King Lajos in Hungarian?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wd3puv/why_are_some_frenchgermanenglish_names/), submitted on 2022-08-01 08:43:10+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 658: [When does ideology and culture intersect with strategy?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wd48qb/when_does_ideology_and_culture_intersect_with/), submitted on 2022-08-01 09:08:00+08:00.

### 660: [kneel before Laplus](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/wdgdfr/kneel_before_laplus/), submitted on 2022-08-01 20:34:05+08:00.

----- __660.1__ -----2022-08-02 00:28:20+08:00:

HK Exhibition Centre, looks like it was taken at Ani-Com today.

### 661: [Why is the Enterprise the only ship with registry repetition?](https://old.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/wdz2d9/why_is_the_enterprise_the_only_ship_with_registry/), submitted on 2022-08-02 09:55:56+08:00.

----- __661.1__ -----2022-08-02 18:26:46+08:00:

I forget if Voyager-J gets specifically named as such, but during the finale arc of S3 Admiral Vance does definitely order it around a bit.

### 662: [Would the Japanese have surrendered to the Soviets if the Americans hadn’t nukes Hiroshima and Nagasaki?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/we634h/would_the_japanese_have_surrendered_to_the/), submitted on 2022-08-02 16:21:59+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf.

### 663: [ELI5: How did the U.S. rise to a global superpower in only 250 years but counties that have been around for 1000s of years are still under-developed?](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/we7chi/eli5_how_did_the_us_rise_to_a_global_superpower/), submitted on 2022-08-02 17:41:26+08:00.

----- __663.1__ -----2022-08-02 22:48:04+08:00:

'Countries' don't really exist on the scale of hundreds of years,. 'China' in its modern form has only existed as far back as 1949 for instance (and whether you count that depends on whether you consider major changes after Mao's death as substantive enough to count). Just because a country *says* it's old doesn't mean it *is*.

### 664: [Marine senchou's birthday celebration advertisement in Hong Kong situated at a... fitting location](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/we9xn6/marine_senchous_birthday_celebration/), submitted on 2022-08-02 20:05:21+08:00.

It's next to a very busy pedestrian overpass.
