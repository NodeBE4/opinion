When free press is the focal point of human rights discussion this year, CCP keeps charging journalists and media that dare to challenge them and speak the truth. Among many others, the arrests of Denise Ho, Margaret Ng are prime examples. RELEASE THEM! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/hong-kong-police-arrest-six-journalists-from-independent-media-outlet-stand-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/hong-kong-police-arrest-six-journalists-from-independent-media-outlet-stand-news</a>

THREAD:<br>1.After the Apple Daily closure, Stand News became the largest free media in Hong Kong. Today, we have witnessed another forced closure with a number of arrests. The message Beijing sends is clear: report in the way that we allow, or end up in jail.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHxry3QXsAMFjM1?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3. It's a colonial law so draconian that the British colonial government ended up abandoning it. The HKG reversed the trend and used it to arrest journalists arbitrarily. Seven former and current editors and board members are arrested, with more than 200 police raid their office.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHxsNM8WQAALCiy?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 4. The police held a press conference and explained that as long as the articles trigger hatred towards the government, whether it's a news piece or a blogger's opinion post, it could violate the law. It means that gov's scandals and problems are not allowed to be exposed.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHxr5bqX0AgaB5F?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 5. Then we must ask: what's left in Hong Kong's press freedom? What does journalism mean if journalists cannot report what the government does not like? It will only become propaganda. And propaganda is the opposite of press freedom.

Re 6. I hope it does not create a domino effect that other smaller independent outlets also disband. The only thing I want the world to do is to publish. To publish about Hong Kong. To publish about the brave journalists that risk so much. We can do something for Hong Kong.

Re 7. Let's not forget who are arrested. Denise Ho, a Hong Kong canto-pop diva who has been very vocal on LGBTQI rights and social justice. She could have lived a prosperous and fancy life if she had stayed silent. But she didn't. Wealth cannot buy out one's faith and values.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHxsPZ4WUAUH41T?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 8. Margaret Ng, a former legislator and well respected barrister. She is 73 and continues to campaign for a better judicial system in Hong Kong. Many political campaigners see her as a role model and the most powerful voice to preserve our values.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHxsWd9WUAcWHKF?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Thank you so much for @IainDale, prominent current affairs program presenter at @LBC, to list "freedom" as the "the most important book" he read this year.<br>I hope it brings courage, hope and empowerment to people. We must act to protect our values. <a href="https://www.iaindale.com/articles/my-top-10-books-of-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.iaindale.com/articles/my-top-10-books-of-2021</a>

//many of us are unable to imagine the life of worrying that, on every single morning, 6:00 a.m., there would be a group of police knocking on your door, and you will be taken away. Possibly, you stay in prison for years before you can come back...// <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/hong-kongs-pro-democracy-leaders-urge-the-west-to-step-up-amid-raids-on-free-press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/hong-kongs-pro-democracy-leaders-urge-the-west-to-step-up-amid-raids-on-free-press</a>

//“They are making it illegal to do honest reporting,”said Nathan Law,“If you ‘incite hatred’ to the government by reporting truthful news, you are also subject to this law, which means you can only talk about the positive side of the government now. ”// <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/speed-of-stand-news-shutdown-sends-chilling-signal-to-hong-kongs-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/speed-of-stand-news-shutdown-sends-chilling-signal-to-hong-kongs-media</a>
