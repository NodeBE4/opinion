**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).

### 853: [What does ‘Dynasty’ actually refer to in Chinese history?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xsw5pv/what_does_dynasty_actually_refer_to_in_chinese/), submitted on 2022-10-01 22:05:02+08:00.

----- __853.1__ -----2022-10-02 21:13:18+08:00:

It took a while but I finally rediscovered an old answer I wrote that covers this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nr8qo8/why_are_chinese_dynasties_not_named_after_the/h0fhsdx/?context=3

To break it down simply, the term 'dynasty' is not an incorrect translation but it's an incomplete one. The most direct translation of the term *chao* is not 'dynasty' but rather 'court', which encompasses both the imperial house as a family entity *and* the institution of the imperial state. Indeed, the term *chao* typically refers not to the imperial house, but rather the state that it ruled. Some historians, especially more recently, have on that basis preferred to use 'Empire' in place of 'Dynasty'.

You ask in your followup to /u/Professional-Rent-62 what the 'nation' was called, and this is perhaps a more complicated question than it first appears. If you actually mean the state, then there was no all-encompassing term that described them all, because it was not perceived that there was a single state that passed between ruling houses, but rather a series of states that were vaguely geographically and ideologically continuous. The Great Qing *was* the name of the state. If you in fact mean 'nation', then there are a whole load of distinct terms, some ethnic like 'Han' or 'Tang', and some cultural like 'Huaxia', that could be used to refer to certain identity groups, but the evolution of these over time is a huge issue in itself.

----- __853.2__ -----2022-10-02 21:26:47+08:00:

In my view, yes.
