你是猜的还是有内部消息

> 哈佛毕业的，怎么也不至于智商不够

我不会恶意猜测cmz智商低，但对于这个阶层的人，上Harvard还是不太难的。貌似没什么逻辑关系

tbh what's problem if he has ties to the ccp or not? If we know that he just donates but not bribes or sth. Sounds like the donation fron other govts are always good things but the ones from ccp are definitely bad things

I think it's because lots of Chinese don't like the cakes tasting too sweet or creamy. Because I don't like the cakes in the states tbh

As an international students, I also feel "annoying" that we have to pay much higher tuitions and pass the higher bars.

I'm not complaining, just wanna say it's a relatively fair game and at least some local students actually get benefit from us.

Also, lots of international students stay in the states to feed the US in the long term which also benefit the locals

### 127: [三个代表理论不了了之是中国这十几年最大的遗憾](https://old.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/b331hz/三个代表理论不了了之是中国这十几年最大的遗憾/), submitted on 2019-03-20 05:18:50+08:00.

----- __127.1__ -----2019-03-21 05:02:32+08:00:

评论们的水平捉急啊，“三个代表”是tg正式从革命党转变为执政党的体现，是意识形态上为转型铺路的重中之重，可不是什么空话。

我觉得“三个”“科发”“习思”里面，“三个”是提得最有水平的，“科发”算是中规中矩，“习思”覆盖面太大了而且现在远远未到盖棺定论的地步。虽然据闻都是王沪宁背后操刀，anyway

我也不认为“三个”完全没实现，事实上政协对改开后民企的吸纳，还有其他各级机构对社会各阶层各团体的吸纳和统战，就是“三个”的具象化。

至于后来有没坚持下去，我认为起码部分还是有所坚持的。我也不太懂怎么样才叫达到目的，难道诸位认为一个“三个”就能让中国转型为宪政体制？还是江泽民是大陆版的蒋经国？都不可能吧。

----- __127.2__ -----2019-03-21 05:05:47+08:00:

民族主义在理论上和宣传上都是指中华民族吧，官方也一直不待见大汉主义

----- __127.3__ -----2019-03-21 05:06:58+08:00:

如果你在问理论层面的话，我记得初中政治书已经讲过了，是对敌人的专制

----- __127.4__ -----2019-03-21 05:42:54+08:00:

你们也太看小tg内的保守力量了，当年邓的资历手段势力比江习大得多，他1978喊改开还要到1992南巡讲话后才彻底定调，算上从打击四人帮起，花了15+年时间，你想想其中的阻力多大

Edit: 所以你认为制度应该怎么安排？我是想不出的，三个代表是为了吸收改开后的利益集团，根本目的还是统战，所以主导的势力肯定也必然是tg。这就又回到“即当裁判员又当运动员”的老问题了...你如何建立一个制度确保“一直吸收新人但又不被新人反噬”？反噬的界限又在哪儿？

----- __127.5__ -----2019-03-21 15:36:00+08:00:

我明白你的意思，但你这问题问得跟我是一样的，要回答“有可能达到效果”不就要回答“怎么达到效果”也就是“'怎么办”

----- __131.2__ -----2019-03-21 15:00:14+08:00:

----- __146.6__ -----2019-03-21 12:25:25+08:00:

虽说新疆其他少民也被维吾尔歧视，不过你看看新疆建国时的民族占比，称其维吾尔族自治区不为过

----- __146.7__ -----2019-03-21 12:28:11+08:00:

中国就是个充满双重思想双重标准的国家。

一边说保护多元文化，一边进行文化沙文主义。

一边花大资金救助濒危文化，一边把活得好好的现存文化赶尽杀绝。

就中国多G点，啥都是不和谐不稳定，也不想想是不是自己的问题。

----- __146.8__ -----2019-03-21 12:55:45+08:00:

虽然我不认可苏联那一套民族治理，但你说新疆不是维吾尔族地盘那就有违事实了。

而且你倒因为果了，是维族在新疆具有统治地位为先/为因，而维族歧视他族和汉地为了管理新疆而设立维治区为后/为果，而不是反过来。

以前新疆汉人占比6%，他们懂维吾尔语和文化，被称为老新疆，后来王震治疆新疆建设兵团入疆的汉族那是后话了。汉族从占比6%到现在跟维族平分秋色。。。看你怎么看了

自然转化跟官方强行抹去是两码事OK？

再说，中国一方面说要多元文化一方面推行文化沙文主义，请问是不是双重思想？

最后，别人的维吾尔语藏语是别人民族的语言，你可以让别人学汉语，但请不要冠冕堂皇说别人的语言要没掉。

厉害，我被你一说还以为我冤枉了你，所以回去看了看。你的原话可是先把“汉化红化”理所应当化，再推出“别人语言灭绝”的理所应当化。

国情论下大家都同样接受爱国教育这我可以理解，但是别人语言文化被灭绝也被你当作是理所应当。若接受你所谓“爱国教育”的代价是自己文化被灭绝，换我我也想独立。

若你这个价值观是对的，那别人有天灭绝中国文化也是对的，仅此而已。做人不要双标，更不要像你最后一段话那样耍流氓。

维语以前没有禁，现在已经禁了。你是真不了解新疆近期的形势变化。禁维语的主因是前几年维语课本被植入了疆独思想。

----- __146.15__ -----2019-03-21 15:27:53+08:00:

1. 我那葬礼是个比喻而已

2. 新疆现在已经开始不仅强力去除穆斯林化（这个我不反对）也开始禁维语了。禁维语主要是因为前几年维语课本被植入疆独思想

3. 是啊，每年春晚都看到“维族舞蹈”，你有空去数一下有几个是维族，为何基本是汉族，奇怪吗？想想为什么？

4. TG也不能说完全灭绝文化，但它是强制要求被严格管控下的文化。不说维吾尔族那么远，看看广州现在00后基本很少会讲粤语就知道了。广州2010年[撑粤游行和后续活动](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E5%B9%B4%E5%BB%A3%E5%B7%9E%E6%92%90%E7%B2%B5%E8%AA%9E%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95?wprov=sfti1) 你知道吗？

5. 其实我也没怪TG的意思，根源是中国元明清开始的僵化的过度大一统思想（我没说大一统不好，但过度不好），直接压制社会的活力、思想和多元化，并且为自己制造很多不必要的敌人和麻烦。不改变，终会有报应（不是迷信那种，是社会发展的规律）

通过时间淘汰的文化那叫优胜劣汰，通过行政手段铲除的文化那叫沙文主义。别觉得我夸大其词或者盖帽子，我很清楚我的用词，就是这么严重。你不能说因为人终归有一死就去杀人，而且这个人死不死还看心情随便判。关键是很多文化上的管控都是没有必要的，但都是仅仅因为上面觉得这样便于管控而管控。说来说去还是秦国法家那一套，万事万物都是达到目的的手段，保护是手段，灭绝是手段，一切看利益需要，本质上缺乏对人性和文化的尊重。

维吾尔族舞蹈那一段，就是政治上的样板戏罢了，这的确是一个政治上的表态，但并不是文化上的尊重。这是一种为了政治服务的文化系统。

对于一个意识形态早已破产需要四个自信来撑腰的国度，说什么取精去粕融入马哲呢？文化这种东西，破了不一定能再立。tg的本质是革命性的，这点一直没变过，这也是tg跟法西斯的本质区别（法西斯是反动性的）。不过tg的意识形态早已死去，只剩下庞大的统治机器在运作，这种情况下还说什么对文化改造呢？只是一堆脓水罢了。

----- __146.21__ -----2019-03-22 13:12:57+08:00:

学校就不用说了，肯定汉语教学。平常的话，大概是街上和公共场合很多都不给用维语交流。家里的话不清楚，但现在不少维吾尔族家庭有汉族干部共居共住，我猜在家也不会经常讲维语了。。。

我这个是少民跟我说的，报道来源的话貌似网上搜有很多，但我不知道怎么才算你说的权威。。。

----- __146.22__ -----2019-03-29 03:28:26+08:00:

----- __153.1__ -----2019-03-21 08:24:35+08:00:

I'm not 00s but based on my observation lots of them are pro-ccp. Still, it's too early to say that since they haven't built stable values and thoughts but I don't think they will change a lot unless China fails suddenly 

There is a famous red anime called [Year Hare Affair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Hare_Affair?wprov=sfti1)  (那年那兔那些事) which prevails in the Chinese teens. You can check it out.

P.S. I would say I don't have much first hand experience irl with 00s but I spend lots of time online to talk with them.

Edit: reply to your added point. I bet everyone knows 三民主义 cuz it's an indispensable part taught in middle school and high school history class.

Edit: sorry, I searched the definition of Millennials: Born 1981-1996 (22-37 years old). So I am one of millennials (I thought  you were talking about the ones born after 2000 my bad). But my answer on 00s above still makes sense to 90s and I can say lots of them are pro-ccp too. A few of them in my WeChat moment even claim that how they earned karma in xuexi qiangguo. Of course, lots of my friends don't have much interest in politics but it's not that correct to say they are anti-ccp. I know several of them strongly anti-ccp tho (appr. 1 in my primary school, 4 in my middle school, 1 in my high school, 3 in my cn uni, and 1 in my us uni).  

Verrry roughly, for the people around me pro-ccp/do-not-care/anti-ccp is 3.5:5.5:1. Not sure 80s but I don't think they have huge difference. I come from a province which is political apathy and the data may be different in other places.

----- __153.2__ -----2019-03-21 09:23:03+08:00:

Do you really feel that or just believe that the Chinese people studying or doing business oversea are always anti-ccp?

Because it's totally contradict to my experience and sometimes I suspect we live in a parallel universe.

I know it's a random thing tho.

----- __153.3__ -----2019-03-21 09:55:31+08:00:

I personally won't call searching banned documents as "awakening". It's a natural movement of every curious Chinese who goes abroad the first time. But it is faaaaar away from that they will turn to be anti-ccp immediately after knowing these materials. Seriously, I have that experience.

I'm lucky enough that I didn't encounter any negative experience from the western students. Most of them are kind and open-minded. I'm not sure about other Chinese teens. But lots of them seem to love China more after going abroad due to other factors. It's a long story and I don't go to expand it here.

----- __153.4__ -----2019-03-21 11:17:59+08:00:

u/xiefeilaga gives the point about racism, you give the point about homesick and  psychological defense mechanism, both are good. 

I give another point here, lots of them grew up with the domestic propagandas saying how the west is advanced but when they go to see the "real" west, they figure out a "retarded" west, outdated infrastructures (eu and ny), boring and inconvenient rural lifes (us small towns), cumbersome and inefficient system (politics, hospital, etc.), anti-intellectuallism and frequent shooting cases (partial us)... They are disappointed about this unexpectation and think Chinese model is proved good and efficient by decades' high-speed growing. They are much more confident than their parents because they see a rise of China with prosperity. They are the generation of witness. At the same time, the western system seems to have their own "problems" recently, brexit, trump, the rise of Europe right wings, Greek bankruptcy, eu refugee crisis, etc.

However, lots of them don't dig out the root of the western system and values which are the "real" west in my eyes. 

I'm not saying the western system is prefect and Chinese system is totally awful, but I suspect lots of my dear Chinese fellows may be too confident due to Chinese blooming economic in last 40 years and ignore the crisis under the warer in long term. btw the west has their own problems in this century tho...

----- __154.6__ -----2019-03-21 11:49:36+08:00:

that's true. I love Lanzhou Lamian 兰州拉面 and know that their menus always have Arabic. I think it's a religional decoration or Halal symbol.

----- __154.7__ -----2019-03-21 13:28:28+08:00:

It's true but I don't think you need to add quotation marks here. ME countries such as SA subsidizing Arabic Islam is not a secret, the difference is that whether you think it's a fair movement or not. 

In 2016, Chinese govt wanted to pass a halal food law to promote the halal food industry,  causing huge grumbles from the people. China accepted large amount of Arabic academic books from SA. China  helped to build lots of huge and fancy mosques. 

It's amazing to see China's U turn this year, both de-Islamism and de-Uhghur-ism which was triggered several years ago.

It really depends on how you think of it. Except the indigenous Taiwanese aborigines which occupy less than 5%, most of them are Han Chinese. Also, the China unification claim is to take back Taiwan as a territory and ban the "exile" government but not erase their "identity"

----- __160.6__ -----2019-03-22 07:41:01+08:00:

I don't mind Taiwan annexes mainland (if Taiwan govt can prove they are qualified enough) or mainland annexes Taiwan. 

I just want to point out that the main reason of unification is territory, face, and historical inertia but not identity erasing. Sure, Taiwan's features may be decreased once it's united but that is a natural result, you are missing the result with reason here.

btw while the west appreciates and supports Taiwan because of its values (Liberalism narrative), the majority mainlander partially attributes the Taiwan issue to the western intervention which can be dated back to *Century of Humiliation* and *neo-colonism* (Nationalism narrative). That's why I say it really depends on how you think of it.

That is, if China embraces democracy and freedom of speech tomorrow, it would definitely become more aggressive on the Taiwan issue. Trust me.

----- __162.1__ -----2019-03-22 08:13:43+08:00:

经济不好当然会有不少人支持复辟，因为现在中国人比前20年更加相信中国的特殊体制优势论。

这几十年的飞速发展，虽然的确有权威体制提供的稳定环境和集中力量办大事的定点突破的助力，但更多要归功于中国人本身勤劳勇拼精明的民族性、中国一穷二白的后发优势以及西方搭建的全球贸易体系。可是很多人经过多年宣传，很容易把改开后的成果全部跟现体制划上等号。

而且转型多多少少是有阵痛期的，要我说的话，低迷起码5年都算轻的了，但有的人当然等不了这么久或者感觉是被人欺骗。加上到时候肯定有很多各利益集团的野心家出来争权夺利混淆视听，必将有领导者鼓吹复辟，必将有起码不少的民意支持。

----- __162.2__ -----2019-03-22 08:24:36+08:00:

我对这点还是乐观的。

1. 中国主体民族的绝对占比优势是跟苏联截然不同的局面，苏联主体民族全国占比[刚过半](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh/1989%E5%B9%B4%E8%98%87%E8%81%AF%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%A3%E6%99%AE%E6%9F%A5) ，中国汉族占比90%，加上汉化各族更加多，新疆汉维占比一比一。

2. 民主化也不一定等于别人有国土分裂的自由，可以先行通过顶层制度设计来规避。参见西班牙加泰罗尼亚独立案，人都被抓了。。。请看判决引用的西班牙宪法[Section 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Spain?wprov=sfti1) :

> Section 2. The Constitution is based on the **indissoluble** unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards; it recognizes and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all.

----- __162.4__ -----2019-03-22 08:32:17+08:00:

两者都是问题

----- __162.5__ -----2019-03-22 08:45:34+08:00:

1. 顶层制度的设计当然不能阻止分裂势力的崛起，但可以赋予镇压分裂势力的法理基础。很多人把民主跟分裂势力自决划等号，我想说的是，实现民主和领土完整在实操层面并不矛盾

2. 世界上国家内部种族繁多的不只有中国，可参见俄罗斯印度南非。当然，他们都貌似没有提供一个完善的解决方案，但也没有闹到分裂的地步。中国特有的优势就是主体民族的绝对压倒性，就算在西藏新疆，汉族经过几十年的发展也势均力敌

3. 民族的语言甚至血腥冲突是肯定有的，具体怎么样只能走一步看一步，但不能因噎废食

我乐观在起码中国不太会步苏联的后尘，至于阵痛和风险，这个是永远无法规避的，甚至以后的话，可能风险更大。就像做手术一样，你做了，有较小几率瘫痪但也许不会，不做，那病就没了？不可能的，只会越发严重，到后面手术都救不了。

FLG organ harvesting is fake news. I will always repeat it

----- __168.2__ -----2019-03-22 08:50:47+08:00:

China had a history of organ harvesting on death sentence prisoners but not target on FLG, and it's banned now. Technically speaking, if a FLG was a death sentence prisoner, then s/he may had that experience but again, it's not targeted on FLG

btw FLG is definitely a CULT. Nobody in China nowadays, no matter they are pro-ccp or anti-ccp, love them. That's all

Of course they're not hard to find. It's also not hard to find Chinese source such as [this](https://pkg2.minghui.org/mh/center/organ/death-roll-organs.html#_6010319958858055_639162290069_36573905925538663) to support your statement but I still doubt it.

Anyway, from my personal experience, FLG is definitely a brainless and anti-intelligence organization, if you think it's too aggressive to call them cult. I don't support an organization claiming that you can cure your cancer w/o going to hospital or encouraging the parents to do qigong with their children but not send their children to schools. They print the words like "Heaven kill the ccp"on the rmb bill. They invest ads in hk claiming that 0.3 billion people give up their ccp membership while there are no more than 0.1 billion ccpers.

----- __169.1__ -----2019-03-23 06:27:22+08:00:

Am Chinese, based on the information I could find from both sides, I personally think the accurate description should be *illegal prison-like job training and reeducation camp*. It's neither normal job training center nor nazi-style concentration camp.

The officers they have a score sheet for every potential target, if they think their scores are negative they would catch them to the camp without justice system. The people inside are forced to learn job skills, religional and ethnic policies, and Han culture. Once they perform well and meet the requirements, they can graduate from the camp with certificates. I don't know how long these camps will be tho, Chen Quanguo, the party strong man  in xinjiang, has claimed that it will be 4-5 years. I also don't know whether there is any torture or sth, but I doubt it widely exists if there is one.

These camps and related activities in Xinjiang, are targeted on de-separatism, de-Islamism, and de-terrorism. 

----- __169.2__ -----2019-03-23 07:17:13+08:00:

> Damn so basically they can just catch one dude for whatever reasons then put him in camp?

Technically yes, at least in the southern Xinjiang. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HBjWPXejsk) is a secret video showing the camp inside.

Lots of people living in those areas cannot find a job and earn money because they don't know any job skills and/or speak Mandarin. Somebody call learning mandarin as assimilation but it's indeed hard for them to have a good life if they don't know the common language in China. I think a fair game is that both sides learn both languages. 

I hate it because it's sth that bypassing the Chinese justice system again. But tbh, some of the Muslim in southern Xinjiang sends their children to Mosques but not schools, which is already against the Chinese law. There is an increasing Wahhabism in Xinjiang. In the long term, ethnic segregation will be larger and cause more conflicts if people there don't talk and learn the language and culture of each side. Is there any good way to solve it w/o violating the law? IDK

Edit: I have to say that I haven't been to Xinjiang and the rising of Wahhabism and Extremism are the ones I learned from reports. I just wanna say, I cannot figure out an extreme humane method to solve the problem.

----- __169.3__ -----2019-03-24 01:14:41+08:00:

I meant the parents *only* sending their children to faith schools but not official schools and it's against 九年义务教育法. There is nothing wrong with mosques (if they don't promote wahhabism) tho. But if they don't prepare the knowledge and skills for future lifes actively, it's a bit hypocrisy to blame the Chinese govt in this case.

----- __169.4__ -----2019-03-24 09:32:18+08:00:

Of course, I saw some people in the US and Europe crossing the road in red light too but I thought it's a trick for convenience and didn't know they're allowed to do that.

But I think jaywalking is not allowed at least in the US? I saw a student was stopped by campus police after crossing the road in the middle

Do you think, Wang Yi, the Foreign Minister of China, need to and/or will intimidate an unknown journalist face to face? Seriously?

Edit: I don't think your video link is a counterpart. In the video, it's a public place that WY may chose to give his tough voice on purpose while intimidating a journalist secretly in a private place is a different story.

Maybe I'm a minority here as a Chinese since I have no problem that Italy or other western countries keep these Chinese cultural relics. On one hand, the west exploited these relics illegally which can be attributed to colonialism and unequal treaty. On the other hand, these relics were maintained well in the west otherwise they would have been probably destroyed in the Chinese civil war or cultural revolution. Of course, today China has the money, experience, and willing to keep them well. But IMO placing them in the western museums is not a bad idea. When I visited the Louvre Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it's amazing to see huge amounts of relics from different civilizations all over the world and they can educate the visitors there, including expanding the Chinese culture. Actually, giving the ownership back to China and keeping their exhibitions in Italy would be a good alternative plan too.

btw I think the museums in the west are more interesting than their counterparts elsewhere. Since I can appreciate the exhibitions from different cultural backgrounds in the western museums but, for instance, I can only see the Chinese ones in China's museums. (This statement may be a bit politically incorrect but here I'm just sharing my personal feeling as a visitor in those museums)

This is well-known to everybody tbh. CCP emphasizes heavily in STEM while skipping the liberal arts and parts of social science on purpose to maintain its governance

BAT, DJI, Huawei, face++, Cambrian, BGI, BYD, NIO etc etc and I just listed digital firms and current rising stars here. And this is just a beginning. Go to check the list of unicorn in the world and count the number 

tbh I think you'd better read some professional reports such as the Economist, McKinsey, government-level think-tanks but not keep saying *personal observation* and *my lifetime* sounds like an idiot 

For instance,

Here is an article from the Economist, "How China Could Dominate Science?": https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/01/12/how-china-could-dominate-science

A more detailed explanation from the Economist, saying that (i) "A study published by Elsevier, a scientific publisher, and Nikkei, a Japanese news business, on January 6th found that China published more high-impact research papers than America did in 23 out of 30 hot research fields with clear technological applications. Chinese science is a nimble giant, capable of piling in on any new field of promise with enormous, often centrally encouraged, force." (ii) "These include applications of the more abstruse aspects of quantum mechanics to computation and cryptography, an area where China is a world leader: it was the first country to send a quantum-encrypted message via a satellite. In computer science, too, it has few peers. Though it does not yet have a semiconductor industry that quite matches those elsewhere, it is world class in many applications, especially in artificial intelligence." (iii) "Genetic research is a field where China has both made big investments and sees a big future. In the bgi, as what was once the Beijing Genomics Institute is now known, China has by some measures the largest genome-sequencing center in the world." (iv) "China’s near-insatiable demand for energy has led to investments in wind and solar power that dwarf those in other parts of the world and is now leading to research into better ways of handling the energy they produce. " (v) "And this is just getting started". Citation: https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/01/12/can-china-become-a-scientific-superpower

Here is another edition discussing "The battle for digital supremacy: America’s technological hegemony is under threat from China". (i) Let me pick up a piece of the article about supercomputer "When Top500, a website, released its latest list of the world’s fastest machines last November, 202 of them were Chinese, accounting for 35.4% of the list’s combined computing power; America’s 143 machines accounted for just 29.6%. Many of the Chinese computers, admittedly, use American chips. But TaihuLight, the champion, proudly uses chips made in China.". (ii) Huawei and semiconductor: "Huawei’s latest Mate 10 handset—the one which AT&T will not now distribute—comes with a “neural processing unit” designed by HiSilicon, a firm based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. Bitmain, which is the world’s biggest maker of computers to mine bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, already develops AI chips much like the ones made by Google and has the means to do much more. Bernstein Research, an equity-research firm, estimates that Bitmain made a profit of between $3bn and $4bn last year, about the same as NVIDIA, America’s biggest AI-chipmaker."

Here is an article about semiconductor industry, "Chinese firms are beginning to succeed further up the value chain, too. [...] But the end of Moore’s law offers China hope, too. One of its side-effects used to be that, as components shrank, chips were able to operate faster. But that effect—called Dennard scaling—broke down in the mid-2000s, which meant that shrinking a chip’s components offered fewer benefits than it used to. For that reason, says Linley Gwennap, a chip-industry analyst, being a pace or two behind the leaders in manufacturing matters a bit less than before.  At the same time, says Andrew Huang, a hardware designer, the slowing of Moore’s law has left the industry as a whole casting about for other ways to build better chips. Attention is gradually shifting, in other words, from refining manufacturing towards cleverer design and new ideas. If that changes the way the chip industry operates, Chinese firms could try to move into this new, relatively unclaimed territory. HiSilicon’s chips offer an example. They include super-specialized silicon designed to speed up calculations that are useful for artificial intelligence, another focus of “Made in China” and an area into which the country is ploughing cash. Quantum computing is another promising avenue. It uses the effects of quantum mechanics to speed up enormously some sorts of calculations. China has made big bets on quantum computing, reportedly spending $10bn to build a big research lab in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province. But it will require the mastery of unconventional physics such as superconducting wires and ion traps, technologies that are very different from what chipmakers use today."
