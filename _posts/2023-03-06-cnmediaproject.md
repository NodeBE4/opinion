The CMP is an independent research project studying the Chinese media landscape within the PRC and globally, as well as the CCP's media and political discourse.

Stories you might have missed from CMP last week. A take from @dbandurski on the Chen Hongyou (陈宏友) incident (remember the student who grabbed the microphone?) and what it says about "China's voice." https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/03/03/a-model-opera-at-lujiang-middle-school/

Re Also, the latest entry in the CMP Dictionary, on "Chinese-style modernization" (中国式现代化), sometimes called "China's path to modernization." This is a big term right now at the NPC. https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/chinese-style-modernization/

In today's official media coverage of the National People's Congress — a good example of catchphrase creation. Appearing for the first time ever is Xi's "Two Must-Haves" (两个必保): 1) a dependable grain/food supply not vulnerable to int'l mkts, 2) a firm manufacturing industry. https://t.co/TArRD36x7u<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqgX0tkaEAEEznt?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The phrase appears in the article in the "newspaper eye" (报眼), the important space right next to the People's Daily masthead. It comes in the text as continued on page 2. http://lianghui.people.com.cn/2023/n1/2023/0306/c452482-32637371.html https://t.co/7RSjAG1HBd<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqgbHdNacAAJO5E?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re But one page-one phrase making the rounds today in the official media is the quote in this article from Xi affirming the importance of manufacturing: "At no time can China be without manufacturing" (任何时候中国都不能缺少制造业). https://t.co/jdvllRuJ7V<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqgbvLCaEAA-RnX?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Will the "Two Must-Haves" (两个必保) stick around? It's hard to say. It could be a momentary phrase for this NPC, quickly fading from view. Or it could persist through 2023, and beyond. The life cycle of CCP buzzwords, or 提法.

A whopping 21 articles use the phrase "Chinese-style Modernization" today in the People's Daily. Learn more about this must-know phrase in the CMP Dictionary: https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/chinese-style-modernization/

Another CCP buzzword of the day: "Whole-process Democracy" (全过程民主). Read up in the CMP Dictionary: https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/whole-process-democracy/

Today in phrase-spotting at the NPC. The People's Daily again gives prominent play to the notion of "high-quality development" (高质量发展), seen in the top headline with "healthy development of the private economy."  The emphasis: reassuring both public and private business. https://t.co/sj3KR0Dl3d<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqk1rhmaUAAFUte?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re In this headline article, two more phrases pop out. We have the "Two Unshakeables" (两个毫不动摇) and the "Three Unchangeables" (三个没有变). The first appeared in the 2012 political report, and the second at the NPC in 2016. Both deal with public/private economy support. https://t.co/iwaeujVNDz<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqk3V-VaYAABvXu?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The "Two Unshakeables" (两个毫不动摇) are about the concerted development of the public sector economy on the one hand, and the private sector economy on the other — the idea being that BOTH are the key to strong economic development in China. https://t.co/0x5IS5gTqr<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqk60OiaMAAdAkJ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The "Three Unchangeables" (or "Three Steadfasts") affirms that 1. the "status" (地位) of the private sector in China's economic development is unchanged, 2. the "unwavering policy" of supporting it is unchanged, and 3. the commitment to a sound private sector env. is unchanged. https://t.co/4Pwam16OQp<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqk9x8naIAAyr1M?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re These reflect unease in China's private sector about the leadership's economic development and governance priorities in recent years. There have been continued questions about whether Xi intends to push ahead with market reforms or pull them back. https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-s-talk-of-two-unwaverings-reveals-private-sector-fears-1.1158460

Re In November 2018, Xi met with entrepreneurs in a bid to calm nerves. And in an interview shortly after, Baidu CEO Robin Li addressed the issue — namedropping both of the above-mentioned CCP catchphrases.

Re Another related term in the official press today: "streamlining services" (放管服). This is about cutting down on red tape to make things easier for business. Read up on the term in the CMP Dictionary: https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/streamlining-services/
