Stories you might have missed from CMP last week. A take from @dbandurski on the Chen Hongyou (陈宏友) incident (remember the student who grabbed the microphone?) and what it says about "China's voice." https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/03/03/a-model-opera-at-lujiang-middle-school/

Re Also, the latest entry in the CMP Dictionary, on "Chinese-style modernization" (中国式现代化), sometimes called "China's path to modernization." This is a big term right now at the NPC. https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/chinese-style-modernization/
