Stories you might have missed from CMP last week. A take from @dbandurski on the Chen Hongyou (陈宏友) incident (remember the student who grabbed the microphone?) and what it says about "China's voice." https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/03/03/a-model-opera-at-lujiang-middle-school/

Re Also, the latest entry in the CMP Dictionary, on "Chinese-style modernization" (中国式现代化), sometimes called "China's path to modernization." This is a big term right now at the NPC. https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/chinese-style-modernization/

In today's official media coverage of the National People's Congress — a good example of catchphrase creation. Appearing for the first time ever is Xi's "Two Must-Haves" (两个必保): 1) a dependable grain/food supply not vulnerable to int'l mkts, 2) a firm manufacturing industry. https://t.co/TArRD36x7u<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqgX0tkaEAEEznt?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re The phrase appears in the article in the "newspaper eye" (报眼), the important space right next to the People's Daily masthead. It comes in the text as continued on page 2. http://lianghui.people.com.cn/2023/n1/2023/0306/c452482-32637371.html https://t.co/7RSjAG1HBd<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqgbHdNacAAJO5E?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re But one page-one phrase making the rounds today in the official media is the quote in this article from Xi affirming the importance of manufacturing: "At no time can China be without manufacturing" (任何时候中国都不能缺少制造业). https://t.co/jdvllRuJ7V<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqgbvLCaEAA-RnX?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Will the "Two Must-Haves" (两个必保) stick around? It's hard to say. It could be a momentary phrase for this NPC, quickly fading from view. Or it could persist through 2023, and beyond. The life cycle of CCP buzzwords, or 提法.

A whopping 21 articles use the phrase "Chinese-style Modernization" today in the People's Daily. Learn more about this must-know phrase in the CMP Dictionary: https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/chinese-style-modernization/

Another CCP buzzword of the day: "Whole-process Democracy" (全过程民主). Read up in the CMP Dictionary: https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/whole-process-democracy/
