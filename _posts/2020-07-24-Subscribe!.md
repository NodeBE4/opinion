   Dear Dishheads,
  </p>
  <p>
   You should by now have received the first edition of “The Weekly Dish.” (If you haven’t gotten it yet, check your Promotions tab; or check your spam folder and mark this address —
   <strong>
    andrewsullivan@substack.com
   </strong>
   — as “not spam,” or add it to your contacts list.) TWD is a work in progress, but I hope you can see how we’re trying to bring back the spirit and the content of the original Dish — which was always deeply reliant on you, your emails and dissents, your ideas and engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
   So if you haven’t subscribed yet,
   <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/subscribe">
    please do so by clicking here
   </a>
   . We need you. Seven years ago, you pioneered the pay-meter premium model for independent journalism, making the Dish one of the first major sites to go subscription-only and ad-free. We’re hoping with your help to take that legacy forward. We have close to 65,000 people on our Weekly Dish email list so far, which is fantastic — more than double the number we had for the Dish itself. But only a small minority have paid up yet. That’s understandable, since TWD only appeared for the first time today, and it’s still free for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
   But now that we’re up and running,
   <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/subscribe">
    please subscribe
   </a>
   . There are several options, such as subscribing on a monthly basis or an annual one — which is a little more affordable. There’s also a pay-what-you-want option for “Founding Weekly Dishheads.” Last time around, many of you were incredibly generous, just to get the principle of reader-supported independent media off the ground. We’d be psyched if you could be as generous this time around. Just click the suggested $200 box and type in your own amount. If you’ve already subscribed but want to help us out a little more, you can always purchase a gift subscription and introduce a friend to the sanest, liveliest forum on the web:
