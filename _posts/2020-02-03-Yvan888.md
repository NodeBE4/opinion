大部分受过教育的中国人知道中国宪法包括言论结社宗教等自由，也知道中国的实际制度没有按宪法运行

但分歧在于，简单地说，有的人认为这是正常的并且是一个权宜之计，也有的人认为这是不正常的。前者可能比较难理解，它涉及中国国情的很多方面

另外，在一个能随便修宪的国度（xjp），没有人会对宪法很认真。更别提中国除了国法还有党规，这是一种隐藏的双轨制

----- __5.1__ -----2020-02-07 05:11:29+08:00:

This is a good question

**IMO the thing does change *a bit***

Generally speaking, I hate the people who always say *Chinese people will wake up; CCP will fall* under each negative news of China, including the Tianjin explosion, NBA tweet, HK protest, etc.

However, in this case, I hold an opposite opinion, especially after the Hubei Red Cross scandal, the fake news of the traditional Chinese medicine posted by CCP mouthpiece, the malpractice of Dali local government, and the death of the whistleblower. The people are angry about the government and even the whole system. Because: 

(1) Every person is involved in this plague (different from the Tianjin explosion). The death number is huge. The impact is huge. The involvement is comprehensive, far-ranging and ongoing so you can test how each component of the whole bureaucratic system works, while the Tianjin explosion can be attributed to the lack of safety regulation of the local government or even the local company.

(2) The white-or-black is clear. There is no room for any foreign intervention excuse (different from HK protest) or any ideology chasm (different from NBA tweet). The target is clear: save the people efficiently and timely. It's a basic humanism that every Chinese can be deeply engaged with. If a government cannot satisfy this fundamental requirement, how can the people trust you?

Unfortunately, the Chinese government did really badly this time, compared to their performance in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The social influence is larger than my expectation, I saw some young people post online that it's their *first time* to be disappointed about this country and question the efficiency of the bureaucratic system. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the people will be strongly against CCP/Xi or even start a revolution tomorrow. But at least the credibility of CCP is dramatically damaged in this incident. **The domestic endorsement of CCP is pretty strong and ascending from 2008 to now and I thought it would go down after one or two decades if China has a recession at that time. But now, the hands of the clock may run faster.**

----- __5.2__ -----2020-02-07 06:30:42+08:00:

You're right. There are lots of people satisfying with the current arrangements and governing and feeling proud of the stuffs such as the speed of hospital construction. But the satisfied people would be *much larger* if the government can handle it more skillfully. 

The young generation, though might be as nationalism​ as their elders (or even more patriotic), are less easy to be fooled.

----- __5.3__ -----2020-02-07 07:10:23+08:00:

exactly my thought, 集中力量办大事 is the most important selling point of Chinese model but they didn't 办 well this 大事

----- __5.4__ -----2020-02-07 19:02:43+08:00:

There will be recession this time but I don’t think the people will blame the government too much because neither plague nor trade war is the government’s fault (at least in their eyes).

I am talking about a longer, possible recession one or two decades later due to the demographic crisis caused by one child policy and other social instabilities. Since economic blooming is the biggest foundation of CCP governing and one child policy is a big “achievement” of CCP, these recessions will probably impair them a lot. Of course, it depends on the actual performance and the scapegoat at that time, who knows.

----- __5.5__ -----2020-02-07 19:24:52+08:00:

What if they think, in this critical moment of the plague, they should show solidarity and fight together with CCP? What if they think, the long recession is a fault of the US’s trade war or something and should work together to fight back? 

Yes, sure, recession and unemployment is a huge social instability factor to CCP but I just don’t think it must turn out to be anti-CCP. Conversely, it has a small possibility to lead a stronger nationalism if the scapegoat is set deliberately and successfully.

Also, don’t forget three years of famine, ten years of the cultural revolution, and the 1989 TAM protest, all of them are severe and unprecedented social instabilities but CCP still keeps the throne firmly.

Edit: from the abstract of your link, it says,

> However, they have so far been unwilling or unable to make fundamental reforms to address procedural injustices

But, for example, there is still a large group of Chinese don't think the western reforms and procedural justice is a good thing... There is a huge gap of ideology and culture so the judgment​ would​ be ​different

Just a reminder: Xi didn’t show up in public and TV over one month in the year before his presidency

By the rumor, it’s due to a failed assassination by a truck assigned by Zhou Yongkang, ending up hurting Xi’s arm

----- __17.1__ -----2020-02-04 07:17:36+08:00:

tbh there are indeed some hyper-wumao social media accounts claiming the possibility of biochemical warfare from the US because of the great timing and the US’s travel ban as a part of anti-China trade war 

I thought when reading: are you serious? 🤥

----- __17.2__ -----2020-02-04 07:38:13+08:00:

Another reason is that these wumao social media accounts need to concoct these stories to feed their subscribers and maintain their influences
