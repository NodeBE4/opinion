### 134: [Any good books providing an overview of Chinese history, preferably with maps?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ssjzbr/any_good_books_providing_an_overview_of_chinese/), submitted on 2022-02-15 04:07:55+08:00.

----- __134.1__ -----2022-02-15 10:27:48+08:00:

Harvard's six-volume *History of Imperial China* series is probably going to be one of the more helpful options for this while still not being beyond a reasonable budget as long as you're aware you're getting up to six books. They're broadly up to date historiographically for the mid-late 2000s, and while they have a relatively thematic and analytical focus over narrative, they are intended to have decent readability for the more general reader, so most of the volumes have a good smattering of maps, figures, and illustrations.

### 137: [The Romulan invasion force in Unification was small because they were relying on previously seeded infiltrators](https://old.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/ssqucd/the_romulan_invasion_force_in_unification_was/), submitted on 2022-02-15 09:30:22+08:00.

----- __137.1__ -----2022-02-15 13:59:42+08:00:

> As for the incompetence of the Zhat Vash, I doubt they'd ignore Data. On the off chance that Maddox got his way and he was disassembled, studied, and could be replicated, that seems like a pretty massive issue for anti-synthetic fanatics...

Leading to a bit of an interesting crackpot theory: what if Data's trial was at least in part engineered by the Zhat Vash, perhaps some strings pulled here and there especially as regards Captain Louvois? It'd be the sort of thing where Romulan intrigue wouldn't be expected because it's seemingly so benign, but where it would at least delay the replication of synthetic life for a while and buy time.

----- __137.2__ -----2022-02-16 00:16:57+08:00:

Like I said, it's not a ploy to *prevent* synthetic development, it's one to *delay* that development until such time as the Zhat Vash can put a concrete plan in action. Within the events in the episode 'The Measure of a Man', the *Enterprise-D* is operating in core Federation territory, and it is unclear how high up Zhat Vash infiltration may have occurred by that stage. They obviously aren't omnipotent, and perhaps at this stage they don't have anyone on the ground who is able to get in a position to straight up destroy Data. If so, there are two options: let Maddox disassemble Data and replicate him – the worst case scenario – or allow Data to be legally protected so that he can't be replicated by anyone, at least in the short to medium term.

----- __137.3__ -----2022-02-16 00:36:25+08:00:

Killing Data within Federation territory would be an obvious act of aggression against the Federation itself. The Zhat Vash may have an ideological outlook but they are also part of the Romulan Empire, and provoking a war in pursuit of their narrower goal would not be ideal if there were potential options that did *not* risk starting a war. All I'm proposing is that it is within the realm of plausibility that the Zhat Vash might have pursued a policy of containment rather than total eradication, and waiting for a more opportune moment. Both options achieve the ideological goal, but one sacrifices a bit of time in exchange for security.

In reference to the trial, perhaps I was too vague in suggesting that they orchestrated the *entire* thing, more that they pulled strings to perhaps help convince Louvois to go ahead with the trial and to rule in Data's favour. They wouldn't have deliberately created a scenario where Maddox even *might* have the opportunity to reverse-engineer Data; rather, Maddox's attempt to requisition him would have been an unexpected development but also an opportunity.

EDIT: Now, if the trial had gone the other way, or not at all, and Maddox *did* get access to Data's internals, *then* the Zhat Vash may have gone to the nuclear option.

### 138: [How did a society as ancient and advanced as Imperial China fall so badly behind in weapon development that Britain crushed them in the Opium Wars?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ssy38a/how_did_a_society_as_ancient_and_advanced_as/), submitted on 2022-02-15 16:18:58+08:00.

----- __138.1__ -----2022-02-16 14:26:30+08:00:

This is a subject I've discussed in several past answers (which I will link in a moment), but to begin with I need to stress that 'a society as ancient and advanced as Imperial China' is, to put it bluntly, a meaningless phrase. *All* societies are theoretically equally 'ancient', and 'advancement' is its own can of arbitrarily-defined, meaningless worms. We may as well ask how a society as 'ancient and advanced' as Rome fell to the Turks in 1453. Presenting imperial China as an 'ancient' society also massively flattens the real changes that occurred in state and society over the over two millennia between the foundation of the first imperial state in 221 BCE and the end of the last imperial state(s) in the 1910s. (See [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4uur3/did_the_various_ruling_dynasties_of_china_ever/hsv34aa/) for a bit more on that.)

On the question of specifically military developments, Tonio Andrade's *The Gunpowder Age* (2016) is far from the final word on the topic, but it is one of the more comprehensive ones. One of the major ideas Andrade puts forward is that the locus of military technological innovation shifted back and forth between Europe and East Asia in the medieval and Early Modern periods: gunpowder weapons were first developed in China, then were brought to Europe by the Mongols in the 14th century, European iterations on these weapons were then brought to Asia in the 16th century, where Asian states iterated on these imports, and many were arguably ahead of European states in some respects until the end of the 17th century. Some polities maintained parity well into the 18th century (Indian states especially); some fell behind by the middle of the 17th (Japan particularly). Andrade puts the Qing divergence in terms of field weapons as starting mainly around 1750; I personally date it more to around 1700. However, he also notes that East Asian polities lagged considerably further behind in naval and fortifications technology – two very important things for the Opium Wars, where the Qing was being attacked (so some better fortifications would have been nice) by sea (for which a more competitive navy would have been nice). Discussion of those are their own, separate issue which I don't feel fully qualified to comment on.

But as for development on land, I discuss some of the issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/okp0aj/why_were_qing_china_and_southeast_asia_never_able/h5a1cmz/) and to an extent [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/o9qve6/dear_early_modern_historians_were_the/h3fb1me/). One issue I could have discussed in the first answer is finance, but that comes through in the second.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 141: [How different would 9/11 be if it happened in the middle of the night?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/stldmw/how_different_would_911_be_if_it_happened_in_the/), submitted on 2022-02-16 11:10:29+08:00.

----- __141.1__ -----2022-02-16 11:31:29+08:00:

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).
