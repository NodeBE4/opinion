### 130: [was there a time in history where a country or group of people rendered aid or defended their enemies due to natural calamity or other hardship?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/srr3zw/was_there_a_time_in_history_where_a_country_or/), submitted on 2022-02-14 03:45:21+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?"

### 133: [Mindless Monday, 14 February 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/ss8zem/mindless_monday_14_february_2022/), submitted on 2022-02-14 20:00:18+08:00.

The hoped-for price rise [failed to materialise](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-companies-spent-millions-on-super-bowl-ads-but-it-didnt-lift-bitcoin-prices-monday-11644876991), so things are definitely trending downward. Just... could they trend *faster* please?

### 134: [Any good books providing an overview of Chinese history, preferably with maps?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ssjzbr/any_good_books_providing_an_overview_of_chinese/), submitted on 2022-02-15 04:07:55+08:00.

----- __134.1__ -----2022-02-15 10:27:48+08:00:

Harvard's six-volume *History of Imperial China* series is probably going to be one of the more helpful options for this while still not being beyond a reasonable budget as long as you're aware you're getting up to six books. They're broadly up to date historiographically for the mid-late 2000s, and while they have a relatively thematic and analytical focus over narrative, they are intended to have decent readability for the more general reader, so most of the volumes have a good smattering of maps, figures, and illustrations.

### 135: [I'm a movie fan in the 1950s-1970s. In the age before VHS, if I happened to miss out on a film while it was in cinemas, am I fairly certain that I will never be able to see it? Or is it likely for a theater to play it again fairly soon?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ssotsp/im_a_movie_fan_in_the_1950s1970s_in_the_age/), submitted on 2022-02-15 07:56:10+08:00.

Sorry, but this response has been removed because we [do not allow the personal anecdotes or second-hand stories](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_personal_anecdotes) of users to form the basis of a response. While they can sometimes be quite interesting, the medium and anonymity of this forum does not allow for them to be properly contextualized, nor the source vetted or contextualized.  A more thorough explanation for the reasoning behind this rule can be found in [this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1kw7/rules_roundtable_vii_no_personal_anecdotes/). For users who *are* interested in this more personal type of answer, we would suggest you consider /r/AskReddit.
