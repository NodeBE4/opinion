### 905: [At the end of the 2022 movie adaption of All Quiet On The Western Front an unnamed German general sends his troops into a suicidal attack against French forces out of sheer spite, only hours before the war ends. Did such an attack or such attacks really happen during the last hours of WW1?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yiogv0/at_the_end_of_the_2022_movie_adaption_of_all/), submitted on 2022-11-01 04:47:24+08:00.

Sorry, but we have had to remove your comment as [we do not allow answers that consist primarily of links or block quotations from sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_do_not_just_post_links_or_quotations). This subreddit is intended as a space [not merely to get an answer in and of itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fb8o/introducing_the_rules_roundtables_20_the/) as with other history subs, but [for users with deep knowledge and understanding of it to share that in their responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). While [relevant sources  are a key building block for such an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_sources), they need to be adequately contextualized and [we need to see that you have your own independent knowledge of the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/). 

If you believe you are able to use this source as part of an in-depth and comprehensive answer, we would encourage you to consider revising to do so, and you can find further guidance on what is expected of an answer here by consulting [this Rules Roundtable which discusses how we evaluate responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/).

### 906: [Author Tom Holland argues that it was not our Greco-Roman western heritage that lead to liberal values, but Christianity, and that the ancient world was notably cruel. Do historians mostly agree with this stance?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yis5pk/author_tom_holland_argues_that_it_was_not_our/), submitted on 2022-11-01 07:19:19+08:00.
