Re Yu has currently been placed in senior cell where the conditions are substandard. He had to use water from toilet due to the lack of clean water. He is also not allowed to go outdoor throughout this duration.

Chinese lawyer #QinYongpei, who has hitherto been detained for nearly 600 days since 1 Nov 2019, has not yet had his case proceeded to trial - way over the legally allowed period of detention.

Re Once again, the authorities refused all application made by this lawyer. Furthermore, as revealed by @zijuan_chen, the Public Security Bureau commissioner threatened this lawyer not to disclose any details of the meeting to @zijuan_chen - the client who appointed the lawyer.
