For the past few weeks, @YingdanL_kk @AnfanChen &amp; I have systematically collected half a million Weibo posts about Ukraine. It’s true that a large portion of Weibo posts attribute cause of war to US/NATO/“Western” aggression or blame Ukrainian government for conflict.

Re But not all hold this view --- only ~50% of posts. ~10% see Russia as aggressor/blame Putin, 15-20% express other opinions (e.g., sympathy for Ukrainians, criticize Putin *and​* Zelensky), and 20-25% share info/facts unrelated to either view (e.g., # of deaths).

Re We estimate % based on sample of 1000 posts randomly selected from the half a million posts (stratified by day), classified by RAs (trained by @YingdanL_kk &amp; @AnfanChen around the clock to achieve high intercoder agreement); thanks also to @debutts for checking coding rules

Re Next step is to train models to classify all posts in our data to see time trends, and analyze Chinese language tweets we've gathered. Our work in @journalqd monitoring Weibo during early days of covid laid ground work for this: <a href="https://journalqd.org/article/view/2561/1821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://journalqd.org/article/view/2561/1821</a>

Re @hcsteinhardt @YingdanL_kk @AnfanChen Not yet, but these are definitely part of the next steps.

Re @christinelu @YingdanL_kk @AnfanChen We didn't limit collection by geography. Agree it would be great to compare. Hard to do because few users (~5%) enable Weibo geolocation or include geography in profile. We've collected Chinese language tweets and aim to use that for comparison (though it's also imperfect).

Re @sfgchen @YingdanL_kk @AnfanChen We're gathering Chinese language tweets for comparison, but agree it would be interesting to look across countries
