For the past few weeks, @YingdanL_kk @AnfanChen &amp; I have systematically collected half a million Weibo posts about Ukraine. It’s true that a large portion of Weibo posts attribute cause of war to US/NATO/“Western” aggression or blame Ukrainian government for conflict.

Re But not all hold this view --- only ~50% of posts. ~10% see Russia as aggressor/blame Putin, 15-20% express other opinions (e.g., sympathy for Ukrainians, criticize Putin *and​* Zelensky), and 20-25% share info/facts unrelated to either view (e.g., # of deaths).

Re This ties into recent observations by @MariaRepnikova &amp; @wendyZhou502,<br><br>Maria Repnikova: In my first collaboration with talented @WendyZhou502 for @TheAtlantic we argue that #China primarily sees the #RussiaUkraine conflict through the prism of the #UnitedStates and more broadly of the #West. 1/11<br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/china-xi-ukraine-war-america/627028/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/china-xi-ukraine-war-america/627028/</a>

Re Next step is to train models to classify all posts in our data to see time trends, and analyze Chinese language tweets we've gathered. Our work in @journalqd monitoring Weibo during early days of covid laid ground work for this: <a href="https://journalqd.org/article/view/2561/1821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://journalqd.org/article/view/2561/1821</a>
