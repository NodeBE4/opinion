### 1010: [How did American opium smugglers operate their business in the 19th century?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zx460b/how_did_american_opium_smugglers_operate_their/), submitted on 2022-12-28 16:10:39+08:00.

----- __1010.1__ -----2022-12-28 17:39:19+08:00:

While the production of opium in India was controlled through an East India Company monopoly, once a chest of opium reached the auction houses at Calcutta it was, for all intents and purposes, on the open market. The opium trade between the British Empire and the Qing is thus best seen not as an exchange between two actors but rather a much more multilateral affair, in which opium was produced in British India and found its end users in various places in China, but where its journey could involve a variety of interests both within and without those two empires. Granted, the 'country trade' that linked Calcutta and Canton was largely dominated by British subjects, but this was not solely restricted to white British merchants: Zoroastrian Parsis worked both as partners of British firms and in pursuit of their own interests, with magnates such as Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy and Rustomjee Cowasjee running their own opium smuggling businesses. And there were some Americans who were able to operate 'country' ships – for instance, the US Consul in China, Benjamin Wilcocks, co-owned at least one opium clipper with his brother, which was used to ship opium to China under British flag during the War of 1812. By the 1830s, the American firm Russell & Co., which bought up its predecessor, Perkins & Co., would account for roughly one fifth of Indian opium exports to China, 
buying opium at auction in Calcutta and smuggling it up the Pearl River Delta.

But we ought to expand our view a little further, because while the EIC held a monopoly on opium production *within its directly-administered territory*, it did *not* have a monopoly on opium on the global market. The princely states of Malwa produced their own opium without Company oversight and exported it via Portuguese Goa, leading to a period of price competition after about 1818, during which the EIC did essentially lose its ability to exert unilateral control over opium prices. The independent state of Sindh produced its own opium as well, which directly contributed to its conquest by the EIC in 1843. Central Asian states like Kokand and Afghanistan had domestic opium industries – indeed, Kokandi opium smuggling in Xinjiang led to the Qing signing a commercial treaty with Kokand in 1835 that was *remarkably* similar to the terms of the later Treaty of Nanjing and Treaty of the Bogue that would be signed with Britain later. And finally, there was the Ottoman Empire, which produced a modest though not insignificant quantity of opium of its own, ranging from around 2500-3000 chests a year, for sale at Smyrna (now İzmir).

While the quantity of Indian opium exported to China far exceeded Turkish supplies, Smyrna nevertheless provided an opium source for businessmen outside the British empire, even before the annexation of Sindh cut off most of the independent supply to Goa, with the harvest season providing opium from late July/early August to spring early the next year. American merchants originally worked with the British Levant Company, but increasingly operated independently after 1800, becoming the chief supplier of Turkish opium to China. Figures from 1829 show that of 2700 chests of opium sold in Smyrna, 1300 were purchased by American merchants for shipment to China (1100 by the consortium of Perkins & Co., J. & T.H. Perkins, and Bryant & Sturgis; the remainder by Joseph Peabody), 5-600 by Dutch merchants for shipment to Batavia (now Jakarta), and the remainder went to the European market.

It's worth briefly discussing the Perkins-Bryant-Sturgis consortium because this does directly bear on part of your question. In effect, this consortium, dominated by the Perkins family, was one that stretched across multiple cities. While J. & T.H. Perkins and Bryand & Sturgis were headquartered in Boston, Perkins & Co. was a branch of the Perkins company based out of Canton; moreover, some members of the Perkins family had settled in Smyrna, creating personal ties to the city. Perkins ships thus linked three nodes not just of the Perkins' business network, but indeed of the family itself. Indeed, the Smyrna connection was been vital to the Perkins family's involvement in Turkish opium: it was thanks to having a branch of the company in Canton reporting on a growing import market, while a branch of the family in Smyrna reported on a growing export market, that the company experimented with shipping opium in the first place. But there was a complication created by the circumstances of Smyrna itself, which was often visited by infectious disease. While Perkins ships did sometimes buy opium directly from Smyrna, it was often the case that they would pick up Turkish opium further west, commissioning other merchants to move shipments to safer middleman ports such in the Western Mediterranean or even as far afield as London, offloading the risk onto their own set of middlemen.

The US role in opium smuggling in China is often badly understated, but its impact was arguably pretty considerable: until about 1800, the East India Company had been able to keep opium prices artificially high through being essentially the only supplier of opium to China outside of small-scale smuggling from Central Asia (and even then it is unclear how far that smuggled opium spread outside of Xinjiang). But the growth of Malwa and Turkish opium destroyed this EIC monopoly, and forced a change of strategy, as the Company, heavily reliant on revenues generated by duties on its opium exports, found that it was being outcompeted on price and so would have to instead compete on quantity. Arguably, it was the rise of the American trade in Turkish opium that led to the EIC changing tack from producing limited quantities of heavily marked-up product to simply flooding the Chinese market instead, with all the ails that followed. In turn, American firms drove competition in the 'country trade' selling Indian opium, securing a significant stake in all areas of the opium commerce.

----- __1011.1__ -----2022-12-30 22:25:00+08:00:

I generally like the combat system in Craig Woodfield's *Ronin* and *En Garde* – models have a combat pool, and at the start of each round of combat they split this pool between Attack and Defence tokens. You then roll for initiative, with each player rolling 1D6; an Attack token can be used to enhance the initiative roll, with the enhancing player rolling 2D6 and discarding the lower. The player with initiative can then make one attack by expending an Attack token, rolling 2D6 and adding any modifiers; the defender rolls 1D6 and adds theirs. If the attack score exceeds the defence, the defending figure takes a wound, whose severity depends on how much the difference is. An additional Attack token can be used to enhance an attack, allowing the attacker to roll 3D6 and discard the lowest, while a Defence token can be used to enhance defence, allowing the defender to roll 2D6 and keep both. Basically, Defence tokens are how you will realistically survive attacks, so it creates an interesting quandary over how many attacks to take and how many defences.

### 1013: [Was the Great Wall of China effective?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zynsu5/was_the_great_wall_of_china_effective/), submitted on 2022-12-30 10:02:21+08:00.

----- __1013.1__ -----2022-12-30 11:43:47+08:00:

I'm sure others can chime in with other perspectives, but to bring up [one of my old posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k3069r/was_the_great_wall_of_china_effective_we_all_know/gdyv0c7/), the answer would seem to be yes. The 'Great Wall', insofar as we can speak of one, was built by the Ming to deter steppe raiders and to avert a steppe conquest, and in that regard it was mostly successful. While the Ming did start seeing Manchu raids after the 1620s, the logistical difficulties of sustaining forces south of the wall meant the Manchus couldn't actually hold any territory. Ultimately, the Ming fell to domestic, not external causes; the Manchus crossed the wall *after* the Ming collapse.

----- __1013.2__ -----2022-12-31 00:12:09+08:00:

It's also outright wrong. While several Chinese states engaged in wall-building, there was no chronologically and territorially continuous structure across northern China until the Ming (although the intellectual notion of a northern frontier persisted even in periods where no functional wall existed). There is no hard evidence suggesting the death count of wall-building labourers outside of perhaps the period after the collapse of the Jin state in the early 300s, and this was associated with all kinds of fortification works by competing states within China, rather than frontier walls across the north. And then we have to note that the Mongols entered China at a time when it *did not have a frontier wall*; the Manchus conquered China *after its previous government collapsed*. You've hit the nail on the head here with regards to the lazy reuse of oriental stereotyping.

No. Raiders are typically not deterred by reminders of the fact that they are committing theft.

----- __1016.1__ -----2023-01-01 01:52:55+08:00:

I hope they will; I don't know if they will. There's historically been a lot of mixed messaging from the talents (at least in EN) on whether the non-JP branches are idol things (Kiara's generally suggested no, Calli's generally suggested yes), and I would imagine that they'd have a clearer line if it was an official position. That said, the idol stuff was basically sprung on Gens 1-3 shortly before 1st Fes and only became formally ingrained subsequently, so there's no reason that we couldn't end up with idol outfits of some kind, if not for 4th Fes then some time later on. Potentially it may end up just being opt-in, especially for those who can or will do a lot of 3d collab concert activities. But as said, we don't know what goes on behind the scenes. But I do hold out hope.

### 1017: [Historically, why did the Chinese lose so many battles to nomadic tribes?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zzzzxu/historically_why_did_the_chinese_lose_so_many/), submitted on 2023-01-01 02:10:03+08:00.

----- __1017.1__ -----2023-01-01 12:40:05+08:00:

/u/0neDividedbyZer0 has written a pretty good answer covering some aspects of the question, but there are a couple of pieces of the puzzle that I think ought to be added.

The main one is that pastoral nomadic societies are *extremely* optimised for military mobilisation, as an extension of the way nomadic lifestyles are sustained. Firstly, just about every member of a nomadic society – women as well as men, mind you – learned to ride as a natural consequence of these societies' mobility. Men especially, but often women too, would learn archery for hunting. In other words, just about everyone in a pastoral nomadic society didn't just know how to ride and shoot, they rode and shot *constantly* out of necessity. The skills necessary to survive on the steppe were the vital skills of premodern combat, more or less by sheer coincidence. Secondly, the amount of labour input required in pastoral nomadic food production was not particularly high nor particularly intensive, which meant that compared to a sedentary polity, a nomadic society could afford to devote a lot more people to fighting relative to food production. Thirdly, as long as you were militarily successful, warfare *was* a form of food production, in that a highly mobile army ranging across a wide area could steal a *lot* of food as booty, so that you didn't need as much livestock in your home herds to feed them anyway. Because of this, a comparatively huge proportion of a nomadic society's population could be sent to fight: Nikolai Kradin estimates that they could mobilise up to 75% of their adult male population, which depending on how you assess dependency ratios translates to just under 20% of the population at large. This theoretical upper limit substantially exceeds most sedentary polities' capacities before the 20th century: for a point of comparison, Metropolitan France mobilised 8 million men out of around 40 million people in WWI, and even then, not all of them were fighting troops, and not all were mobilised simultaneously, *and* this mobilisation placed an extraordinary strain on France as a country, whereas large-scale mobilisations of steppe nomadic warriors were a matter of course.

Another, though, is that vulnerability to nomads was not a uniquely Chinese problem – European, Middle Eastern and South Asian polities similarly struggled. For a bit more detail you may want to have a look at some of my other past answers:

> AFAIK Nijisanji is still bigger in Japan.

So, it gets Complexicated depending on what metrics you use and how deep you delve. Here I'm going off sub counts:

Last I checked Niji claims around 60m total subscribers across its roughly 170 YT channels; Holo claims around 69 million across 71. Holo's international branches account for a little over 23 million as of current count, so more or less exactly a third. NijiEN accounts for about 14.5 million, or just under a quarter. So in that sense, Nijisanji's Japanese branch draws a bigger proportion of Nijisanji viewership compared to Hololive's Japanese branches for Hololive. However, the overall sizes of their Japanese branches, going by pure subscriber numbers, are more or less exactly the same at around 46 million. (Indeed, Niji might be very slightly smaller.)

What then complicates this further is that Nijisanji's Japanese branch is much bigger in terms of total membership (141) compared to Hololive's (35 Hololive and 13 Holostars for 48 total). The big open question when it comes to viewership practices is how many people subscribe to how many channels. A so-called 'DD' (*daredemo daisuki*, 'loves anyone') may well subscribe to everyone as a sign of support, but a DD for Nijisanji will add 141 subscribers to the total count while one for Hololive will add 48. So I think it's likely, but not certain, that the subscriber overlap inflates Nijisanji's total viewership figures to a greater extent than Hololive's, *especially* if we account for the trend of existing agency fans mass-subbing to a new talent pre-debut rather than new debutants starting from scratch. All of Nijisanji EN's most recent group of 6 debutants, XSoleil, hit 100k subscribers from pre-debut hype, but those 600k total subscrip*tions* came from 100k subscri*bers*, if that makes sense. The same, of course, is true of HoloEN Council getting at least 200k each pre-debut.

But then the elephant in the room is overseas viewership of Japanese talents and Japanese viewership of non-overseas talents, and in that situation we can't really extrapolate from individual members' occasional statements too much. Stream donation currency breakdowns might be the only viable route, but I've only ever seen it done by Hololive stats nerds any not for Niji. It's probably reasonable to say that overseas viewership accounts for more of HoloJP's audience than it does for NijiJP, but how far is unclear. Presumably that counteracts the statistical effect of subscriber overlaps a bit if we're trying to ascertain audience sizes within Japan, but in the end, there's a lot of variables to control for, not all of which are possible to mine the stats for directly.

I'll add also that there are sites like VStats that have [daily top 50 leaderboards for maximum and average stream viewership](https://www.vstats.jp/leaderboard/today), and a quick scroll suggests that Hololive usually dominates the top 25, except on major event days. For instance the free part of Day 1 of Nijisanji's end-of-year event on [29 December](https://www.vstats.jp/leaderboard/2022-12-29) got a whopping 242k maximum concurrent viewers, while Hololive's [end-of-year event on 31 December](https://www.vstats.jp/leaderboard/2022-12-31) got 197k. So Niji can definitely get a lot of viewers together for agency-wide events, but the maximum viewership of any individual talent tends to be lower than their Hololive equivalents.

----- __1018.3__ -----2023-01-03 01:07:27+08:00:

It'll depend obviously, but at the same time, Salome didn't hit the VTuber record for fastest to 1m subs based purely off organic success. Niji hardly lacks brand identity, and especially when we look at more recent talent waves, which have been concentrated in the EN branch, there's a lot of existing audience recycling at work. And I don't want to say this as some kind of bad thing; rather, I raise it as something that complicates the superficial numbers considerably.
