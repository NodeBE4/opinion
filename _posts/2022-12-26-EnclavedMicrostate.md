### 1010: [How did American opium smugglers operate their business in the 19th century?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zx460b/how_did_american_opium_smugglers_operate_their/), submitted on 2022-12-28 16:10:39+08:00.

While the production of opium in India was controlled through an East India Company monopoly, once a chest of opium reached the auction houses at Calcutta it was, for all intents and purposes, on the open market. The opium trade between the British Empire and the Qing is thus best seen not as an exchange between two actors but rather a much more multilateral affair, in which opium was produced in British India and found its end users in various places in China, but where its journey could involve a variety of interests both within and without those two empires. Granted, the 'country trade' that linked Calcutta and Canton was largely dominated by British subjects, but this was not solely restricted to white British merchants: Zoroastrian Parsis worked both as partners of British firms and in pursuit of their own interests, with magnates such as Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy and Rustomjee Cowasjee running their own opium smuggling businesses. And there were some Americans who were able to operate 'country' ships – for instance, the US Consul in China, Benjamin Wilcocks, co-owned at least one opium clipper with his brother, which was used to ship opium to China under British flag during the War of 1812. By the 1830s, the American firm Russell & Co., which bought up its predecessor, Perkins & Co., would account for roughly one fifth of Indian opium exports to China, 
buying opium at auction in Calcutta and smuggling it up the Pearl River Delta.

But we ought to expand our view a little further, because while the EIC held a monopoly on opium production *within its directly-administered territory*, it did *not* have a monopoly on opium on the global market. The princely states of Malwa produced their own opium without Company oversight and exported it via Portuguese Goa, leading to a period of price competition after about 1818, during which the EIC did essentially lose its ability to exert unilateral control over opium prices. The independent state of Sindh produced its own opium as well, which directly contributed to its conquest by the EIC in 1843. Central Asian states like Kokand and Afghanistan had domestic opium industries – indeed, Kokandi opium smuggling in Xinjiang led to the Qing signing a commercial treaty with Kokand in 1835 that was *remarkably* similar to the terms of the later Treaty of Nanjing and Treaty of the Bogue that would be signed with Britain later. And finally, there was the Ottoman Empire, which produced a modest though not insignificant quantity of opium of its own, ranging from around 2500-3000 chests a year, for sale at Smyrna (now İzmir).

While the quantity of Indian opium exported to China far exceeded Turkish supplies, Smyrna nevertheless provided an opium source for businessmen outside the British empire, especially after the annexation of Sindh cut off most of the independent supply to Goa, with the harvest season providing opium from late July/early August to spring early the next year. American merchants originally worked with the British Levant Company, but increasingly operated independently after 1800, becoming the chief supplier of Turkish opium to China. Figures from 1829 show that of 2700 chests of opium sold in Smyrna, 1300 were purchased by American merchants for shipment to China (1100 by the consortium of Perkins & Co., J. & T.H. Perkins, and Bryant & Sturgis; the remainder by Joseph Peabody), 5-600 by Dutch merchants for shipment to Batavia (now Jakarta), and the remainder went to the European market.

It's worth briefly discussing the Perkins-Bryant-Sturgis consortium because this does directly bear on part of your question. In effect, this consortium, dominated by the Perkins family, was one that stretched across multiple cities. While J. & T.H. Perkins and Bryand & Sturgis were headquartered in Boston, Perkins & Co. was a branch of the Perkins company based out of Canton; moreover, some members of the Perkins family had settled in Smyrna, creating personal ties to the city. Perkins ships thus linked three nodes not just of the Perkins' business network, but indeed of the family itself. Indeed, the Smyrna connection was been vital to the Perkins family's involvement in Turkish opium: it was thanks to having a branch of the company in Canton reporting on a growing import market, while a branch of the family in Smyrna reported on a growing export market, that the company experimented with shipping opium in the first place. But there was a complication created by the circumstances of Smyrna itself, which was often visited by infectious disease. While Perkins ships did sometimes buy opium directly from Smyrna, it was often the case that they would pick up Turkish opium further west, commissioning other merchants to move shipments to safer middleman ports such in the Western Mediterranean or even as far afield as London, offloading the risk onto their own set of middlemen.

The US role in opium smuggling in China is often badly understated, but its impact was arguably pretty considerable: until about 1800, the East India Company had been able to keep opium prices artificially high through being essentially the only supplier of opium to China outside of small-scale smuggling from Central Asia (and even then it is unclear how far that smuggled opium spread outside of Xinjiang). But the growth of Malwa and Turkish opium destroyed this EIC monopoly, and forced a change of strategy, as the Company, heavily reliant on revenues generated by duties on its opium exports, found that it was being outcompeted on price and so would have to instead compete on quantity. Arguably, it was the rise of the American trade in Turkish opium that led to the EIC changing tack from producing limited quantities of heavily marked-up product to simply flooding the Chinese market instead, with all the ails that followed.

I mean they have happened, and then people wouldn't shut up about them, and so they've gone much more private at the very least, assuming they didn't break up altogether. Crossick, Noefure, and Okakoro all sort of went that way.

### 1012: [Was the Great Wall of China effective?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zynsu5/was_the_great_wall_of_china_effective/), submitted on 2022-12-30 10:02:21+08:00.

I'm sure others can chime in with other perspectives, but to bring up [one of my old posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k3069r/was_the_great_wall_of_china_effective_we_all_know/gdyv0c7/), the answer would seem to be yes. The 'Great Wall', insofar as we can speak of one, was built by the Ming to deter steppe raiders and to avert a steppe conquest, and in that regard it was mostly successful. While the Ming did start seeing Manchu raids after the 1620s, the logistical difficulties of sustaining forces south of the wall meant the Manchus couldn't actually hold any territory. Ultimately, the Ming fell to domestic, not external causes; the Manchus crossed the wall *after* the Ming collapse.
