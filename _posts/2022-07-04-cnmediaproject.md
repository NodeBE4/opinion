RT Don Weinland<br>For the next year (at least), coverage of covid in China is going to manifest in just a few headlines: declaring victory/loosening rules and new outbreaks/rules tighten. The place names will change but not much else will.

RT Mike Forsythe  傅才德<br>Re @DavidBarboza2 @amyyqin By the way, happy fourth of July. In the USA, we can report on the wealth and corruption of top leaders without fear of going to jail. Unfortunately, Chinese reporters don't have that freedom. Hope some day they do!

Re @GeringTuvia This is a good opportunity to share CMP's analysis more than 10 years ago on the "three afflictions" 三挨reflected here -- which Xi has taken on with his own form of empowered victimhood. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2010/01/05/ccp-media-policy-and-chinas-third-affliction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2010/01/05/ccp-media-policy-and-chinas-third-affliction/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FW4HRDjagAAD98g?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

This Yang Haipeng tribute is a journey thru media history: "As traditional media declined, Old Yang continued to be active on social media. What he did was no different from the newspaper era – exposing corruption, and expanding the space for speech." <a href="https://bit.ly/3P2xzOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3P2xzOP</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FW4fmELaMAUR5jJ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

A national security review of China's leading academic research database, CNKI, announced last month by cyberspace authorities, is not so much about sensitive content as about the potential sensitivities of public access.

RT Patrick Boehler<br>CNKI was invaluable when it still contained the dissertations of later party &amp; business leaders.

Now in the CMP Dictionary: "common prosperity" (共同富裕). Under Xi, the term is about curtailing excessive wealth and promoting "people-centered development." But in CCP history the term has supported dramatically different priorities. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/common-prosperity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/common-prosperity/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXHzHUoaMAAFLMa?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
