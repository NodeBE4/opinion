The largest National Security Law case in Hong Kong has begun. Here are some facts in a 🧵:<br>1. Around two third of the defendants have been detained for almost two years. They were denied bail on the basis that "they may conduct activities that endanger national security."<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FoXrcDTXoAEtQ1A?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 2. Campaigners are charged due to an action every party would do in a democracy — joining a primary election. The HK authority equates "vetoing budget" as "topping the government," thus committing a "subversive action." How ridiculous is it?

Re 3. The Beijing authority makes the rule for the trial. They handpicked judges, denied the right to a jury, and made the law. <br>4. Defendants' lawyers are named by pro-Beijing newspapers, which is a sign that the govt plans to go after them.

Re 6. The maximum penalty they face is a life sentence. Though we think that it's unlikely they would get that maximum penalty; however, it is expected that "masterminds" like Benny Tai would receive more than a decade of imprisonment.

Re 8. Most of the defendants are my friends. They are activists, professors, veteran lawmakers, lawmakers....... the kind of people who you think are least likely to be jailed in a democracy. Yet they are there.

Re The prison walls encompass them not because they've done anything wrong, but because the govt wanted them to be silenced. That's why we have to continue to voice for them. <br>@joshuawongcf @yttai @LesterShum @ChuHoiDick <br>#HongKong #Politicalprisoners<br>Photo: Nikkei Asia<br>-END
