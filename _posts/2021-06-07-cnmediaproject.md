RT Ian Johnson<br>Great interview with @YanzhongHuang of @CFR_org in @thewirechina on public health:  "even though they have successfully contained the [Covid] outbreak, which they say shows the superiority of the China model, they also feel very insecure." <a href="https://www.thewirechina.com/2021/06/06/yanzhong-huang-on-why-chinas-strength-is-also-its-weakness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thewirechina.com/2021/06/06/yanzhong-huang-on-why-chinas-strength-is-also-its-weakness/</a>

For China's young students, annual college entrance examinations are an important rite of passage on the road to university degrees. But they are also an important way to test students' sense of patriotism and dedication to the CCP-led system. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/06/08/testing-for-devotion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/06/08/testing-for-devotion/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3V7Gy3XMAAEC-q?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Carl Minzner<br>Anyone interested in China’s 躺平 (lying flat) movement should read this article by @judytzchen on the discontents of a generation of Taiwanese youth. And then check out what has been happening in Japan since the 1990s. <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/152268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://international.thenewslens.com/article/152268</a>
