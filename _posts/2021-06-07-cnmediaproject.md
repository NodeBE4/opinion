RT Carl Minzner<br>(1/2) Watch China's state media grapple with how to address the 躺平 movement. <br><br>There's a superficial attempt to valorize it: "China's Gen Z is choosing its own path."<br><br>But one senses contempt underneath: "Slackers, work harder, like your parents did." <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/06/c_139992192.htm?bsh_bid=5615655080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/06/c_139992192.htm?bsh_bid=5615655080</a>

RT Ian Johnson<br>Great interview with @YanzhongHuang of @CFR_org in @thewirechina on public health:  "even though they have successfully contained the [Covid] outbreak, which they say shows the superiority of the China model, they also feel very insecure." <a href="https://www.thewirechina.com/2021/06/06/yanzhong-huang-on-why-chinas-strength-is-also-its-weakness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thewirechina.com/2021/06/06/yanzhong-huang-on-why-chinas-strength-is-also-its-weakness/</a>

For China's young students, annual college entrance examinations are an important rite of passage on the road to university degrees. But they are also an important way to test students' sense of patriotism and dedication to the CCP-led system. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/06/08/testing-for-devotion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/06/08/testing-for-devotion/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3V7Gy3XMAAEC-q?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re How would you reflect, in 800 words or more, on the "revolutionary culture and advanced socialist culture nurtured in the great struggle carried out by the Party in uniting and leading the people"? The clock starts now.

RT Carl Minzner<br>Anyone interested in China’s 躺平 (lying flat) movement should read this article by @judytzchen on the discontents of a generation of Taiwanese youth. And then check out what has been happening in Japan since the 1990s. <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/152268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://international.thenewslens.com/article/152268</a>
