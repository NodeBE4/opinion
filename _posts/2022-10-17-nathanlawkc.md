I’ve repeatedly stated it: Hong Kong protestors fight against the dictatorial PRC regime, not the Chinese people. We stand in solidarity with brave dissidents in China and overseas. We have the same demands – to elect govts leaders, and determine our futures.<br>#致四通橋彭載舟勇士<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfQbCD5XEAYfO0Y?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

The police confirmed that the Hong Kong protestor was dragged inside the consulate area and assaulted; Instead, spokesman from Beijing claimed that he 'illegally entered' the consulate.<br>This is lying, victim blaming, and disgusting—true nature of CCP. We cannot tolerate it.
