   2016 has been quite the year for the world at large and
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-state-of-technology-at-the-end-of-2016/">
    for tech specifically
   </a>

     The Future of Podcasting

   Five Big Ideas
  </h4>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/tv-advertisings-surprising-strength-and-inevitable-fall/">
     TV Advertising’s Surprising Strength — And Inevitable Fall
    </a>
    — TV advertising is having a good week at the upfronts, and it may be more resilient than expected. That, though, means the crash will be even more abrupt (

    ).
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/">
     The Curse of Culture
    </a>
    — It is very fair to say that Apple is threatened by the potential rise of AI. Google, though, is also threatened by its inability to own customers’ attention. The solution for both companies may entail changing their culture, a very tall order indeed.
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">
     Everything as a Service
    </a>
    — We have likely reached Peak iPhone, and if not, it’s only a matter of time; physical goods can only scale so far. The future, thanks to the Internet, is everything-as-a-service.
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-it-era-and-the-internet-revolution/">
     The IT Era and the Internet Revolution
    </a>
    — The history of technology is of two distinct eras: information technology enhanced existing business. The Internet revolution is destroying them (

    ).
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/cars-and-the-future/">
     Cars and the Future
    </a>
    — A massive revolution in cars seems right around the corner. However, I think it will take longer then most technologists assume, but when it comes it will come quickly (

  </h4>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">
     The Voters Decide
    </a>
    — An apolitical analysis of what is happening in U.S. politics through the lens of Aggregation Theory (
    <em>
     Editor’s Note: I’m biased but believe more than ever that this is a critical piece to understanding what is happening in western democracies

    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-brexit-possibility/">
     The Brexit Possibility
    </a>
    — Brexit’s downsides are clear; might tech help realize upsides in building something new based on a new world order? (

   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/antitrust-and-aggregation/">
     Antitrust and Aggregation
    </a>
    — The European Commission’s antitrust case against Google is likely to be the first of many against aggregators, because the end game of Aggregation Theory is monopoly.

   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-reality-of-missing-out/">
     The Reality of Missing Out
    </a>
    — Tech is entering a period of inequality where the big winners lift the sector as a whole even as smaller companies suffer. The best example is Facebook, Google, and digital advertising (
    <em>
     Editor’s note: Over the last year this has gone from projection to reality
    </em>
    ).
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/fake-news/">
     Fake News
    </a>
    — Facebook is under fire for fake news and filter bubbles; they are a problem, but most of the proposed solutions are far worse (

   Five Company-Specific Posts

  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/">
     The Amazon Tax
    </a>
    — Amazon is building a lot of businesses that look like AWS: taxes on major industries that work to everyone’s benefit. The reason, though, is that AWS is a lot like Amazon itself.

    <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-ladder/">
     Snapchat’s Ladder
    </a>

     Facebook, Phones, and Phonebooks
    </a>
