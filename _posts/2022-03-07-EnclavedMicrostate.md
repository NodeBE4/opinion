### 204: [the ol us vs uk](https://old.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/t8bsfn/the_ol_us_vs_uk/), submitted on 2022-03-07 07:45:59+08:00.

----- __204.1__ -----2022-03-07 13:22:04+08:00:

The Oxford/Cambridge college system is, however, unique within the UK; no other universities maintain anything similar. There are technically separate colleges of the University of London, but each 'college' is functionally a self-contained university for all intents and purposes, with the 'University' designation being an extremely loose one.

----- __204.2__ -----2022-03-07 18:06:03+08:00:

Indeed; my phrasing is potentially a little awkward, but the two sentences are not meant to be linked. i.e. 'Oxford and Cambridge have a unique college-university arrangement, whereas the University of London is a loose association of entities that are named 'colleges' but are otherwise self-contained universities'.

### 205: [Marin Kitagawa as Calli, Calli shocked.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/t8dfiu/marin_kitagawa_as_calli_calli_shocked/), submitted on 2022-03-07 09:10:44+08:00.

----- __205.1__ -----2022-03-07 11:15:10+08:00:

I can just hear Calli's scream here.

----- __205.2__ -----2022-03-07 13:49:50+08:00:

Oh I was thinking more her classic incoherent screeches such as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wPSZQOL6YE)

### 206: [Wikipedia claims that the Mughal ruler Akbar assembled some 400,000 troops for the Battle of Tukaroi. What were the logistics like for the Mughals at this time, that this army – or one large enough to be exaggerated to 400,000 – could be maintained in the field?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t8fjzz/wikipedia_claims_that_the_mughal_ruler_akbar/), submitted on 2022-03-07 11:05:45+08:00.

----- __206.1__ -----2022-03-07 18:35:55+08:00:

Thank you!

### 207: [What was the population of the Kingdom of David?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t9icbh/what_was_the_population_of_the_kingdom_of_david/), submitted on 2022-03-08 22:45:31+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 208: [What is the weirdest story you know from the 1500's?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t9j57x/what_is_the_weirdest_story_you_know_from_the_1500s/), submitted on 2022-03-08 23:23:45+08:00.

----- __208.1__ -----2022-03-08 23:40:50+08:00:

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.

### 209: [How did Japanese culture become so deeply entrenched in Western consciousness compared to Chinese and Korean culture?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ta6g2t/how_did_japanese_culture_become_so_deeply/), submitted on 2022-03-09 20:10:26+08:00.

----- __209.1__ -----2022-03-11 00:44:48+08:00:

Answers in the subreddit are expected to be in-depth and comprehensive, as laid out in the [subreddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). There is no hard and fast definition of that, but in evaluating what you know on the topic, and what you are planning to post, consider whether your answer will demonstrate these four qualities to a reader:

* [Do I have the expertise needed to answer this question?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/)
* [Have I done research on this question?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3peg6/rules_roundtable_x_informed_complete_answers_the/)
* [Can I cite academic quality primary and secondary sources?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1ieh/rules_roundtable_v_sources_what_is_required/)
* [Can I answer follow-up questions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/)

In this particular case, there's a lot of interesting information here about nineteenth-century East Asia and about Euro-Asian perceptions in that period, but not a lot on the core question regarding how Japanese, Chinese, and Korean cultural influence have been sustained in the West, especially in the twentieth century to the (rough) present. Where connections are made between political history and cultural contacts, they aren't elaborated enough and tend to verge on being outright speculative, rather than drawing on scholarship specifically analysing such linkages. While the sources you've included are reasonable for a discussion of East Asian political history, they’re either unrelated or at most tangentially related to the history of cultural reception.

If you have further questions, please [reach out to us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians). Thank you!

### 210: [Why the inclusion of the baltic states in NATO didn't led to a crisis with Moscow?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ta77nw/why_the_inclusion_of_the_baltic_states_in_nato/), submitted on 2022-03-09 20:57:31+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it violates our ['20-Year Rule'](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events). To discourage off-topic discussions of current events, questions, answers, and all other comments must be confined to events that happened 20 years ago or more. For further explanation of this rule, feel free to consult [this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glj8c4/rules_roundtable_xii_the_twenty_year_rule/).

### 211: [Whose "mythos" has changed the most since their debut?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tabb5s/whose_mythos_has_changed_the_most_since_their/), submitted on 2022-03-10 00:17:34+08:00.

----- __211.1__ -----2022-03-11 02:37:02+08:00:

To be fair 'de gozaru' is an archaic form of 'desu', so it's not a tic so much as a general idiosyncracy along the lines of someone using 'thou' and its derivatives for second-person singular.

### 212: [When the Soviet Union fell at the end of 1991, its last member was the Kazakhstan Soviet. The UN Charter in 1945 made the Soviet Union one of the the Permanent 5 (P5) members of the UN's security council. Why is Russia today one of the P5 when Kazakhstan is clearly the successor of the USSR?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tb0z2i/when_the_soviet_union_fell_at_the_end_of_1991_its/), submitted on 2022-03-10 23:19:31+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or [moralizing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/) it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.

### 213: [A wealthy and/or noble family in medieval Europe had a better or worse quality of life than a modern-day south-American rural family?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tb11yg/a_wealthy_andor_noble_family_in_medieval_europe/), submitted on 2022-03-10 23:23:28+08:00.

### 214: [Are there any information about the 12 gates of Tashkent?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tbgjd3/are_there_any_information_about_the_12_gates_of/), submitted on 2022-03-11 11:15:27+08:00.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 215: [Why didn't the British take the Dutch east indies for themselves at the end of the Napoleonic Wars?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tbgtki/why_didnt_the_british_take_the_dutch_east_indies/), submitted on 2022-03-11 11:31:05+08:00.

----- __215.1__ -----2022-03-11 12:02:15+08:00:

Hey there,

Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.

If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, [consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) (rather than why what didn't happen didn't happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!

### 216: [Has there ever been a three-sided battle in history?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tbgwll/has_there_ever_been_a_threesided_battle_in_history/), submitted on 2022-03-11 11:35:45+08:00.
