The Oxford/Cambridge college system is, however, unique within the UK; no other universities maintain anything similar. There are technically separate colleges of the University of London, but each 'college' is functionally a self-contained university for all intents and purposes, with the 'University' designation being an extremely loose one.

Indeed; my phrasing is potentially a little awkward, but the two sentences are not meant to be linked. i.e. 'Oxford and Cambridge have a unique college-university arrangement, whereas the University of London is a loose association of entities that are named 'colleges' but are otherwise self-contained universities'.

I can just hear Calli's scream here.

Oh I was thinking more her classic incoherent screeches such as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wPSZQOL6YE)

### 206: [Wikipedia claims that the Mughal ruler Akbar assembled some 400,000 troops for the Battle of Tukaroi. What were the logistics like for the Mughals at this time, that this army – or one large enough to be exaggerated to 400,000 – could be maintained in the field?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t8fjzz/wikipedia_claims_that_the_mughal_ruler_akbar/), submitted on 2022-03-07 11:05:45+08:00.
