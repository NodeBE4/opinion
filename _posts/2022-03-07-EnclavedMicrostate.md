### 204: [the ol us vs uk](https://old.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/t8bsfn/the_ol_us_vs_uk/), submitted on 2022-03-07 07:45:59+08:00.

----- __204.1__ -----2022-03-07 13:22:04+08:00:

The Oxford/Cambridge college system is, however, unique within the UK; no other universities maintain anything similar. There are technically separate colleges of the University of London, but each 'college' is functionally a self-contained university for all intents and purposes, with the 'University' designation being an extremely loose one.

----- __204.2__ -----2022-03-07 18:06:03+08:00:

Indeed; my phrasing is potentially a little awkward, but the two sentences are not meant to be linked. i.e. 'Oxford and Cambridge have a unique college-university arrangement, whereas the University of London is a loose association of entities that are named 'colleges' but are otherwise self-contained universities'.

### 205: [Marin Kitagawa as Calli, Calli shocked.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/t8dfiu/marin_kitagawa_as_calli_calli_shocked/), submitted on 2022-03-07 09:10:44+08:00.

I can just hear Calli's scream here.

Oh I was thinking more her classic incoherent screeches such as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wPSZQOL6YE)

### 206: [Wikipedia claims that the Mughal ruler Akbar assembled some 400,000 troops for the Battle of Tukaroi. What were the logistics like for the Mughals at this time, that this army – or one large enough to be exaggerated to 400,000 – could be maintained in the field?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t8fjzz/wikipedia_claims_that_the_mughal_ruler_akbar/), submitted on 2022-03-07 11:05:45+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

### 209: [What is the weirdest story you know from the 1500's?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t9j57x/what_is_the_weirdest_story_you_know_from_the_1500s/), submitted on 2022-03-08 23:23:45+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.

### 210: [How did Japanese culture become so deeply entrenched in Western consciousness compared to Chinese and Korean culture?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ta6g2t/how_did_japanese_culture_become_so_deeply/), submitted on 2022-03-09 20:10:26+08:00.

----- __210.1__ -----2022-03-11 00:44:48+08:00:

Answers in the subreddit are expected to be in-depth and comprehensive, as laid out in the [subreddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). There is no hard and fast definition of that, but in evaluating what you know on the topic, and what you are planning to post, consider whether your answer will demonstrate these four qualities to a reader:

* [Do I have the expertise needed to answer this question?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/)
* [Have I done research on this question?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3peg6/rules_roundtable_x_informed_complete_answers_the/)
* [Can I cite academic quality primary and secondary sources?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1ieh/rules_roundtable_v_sources_what_is_required/)
* [Can I answer follow-up questions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/)

In this particular case, there's a lot of interesting information here about nineteenth-century East Asia and about Euro-Asian perceptions in that period, but not a lot on the core question regarding how Japanese, Chinese, and Korean cultural influence have been sustained in the West, especially in the twentieth century to the (rough) present. Where connections are made between political history and cultural contacts, they aren't elaborated enough and tend to verge on being outright speculative, rather than drawing on scholarship specifically analysing such linkages. While the sources you've included are reasonable for a discussion of East Asian political history, they’re either unrelated or at most tangentially related to the history of cultural reception.

To be fair 'de gozaru' is an archaic form of 'desu', so it's not a tic so much as a general idiosyncracy along the lines of someone using 'thou' and its derivatives for second-person singular.

### 213: [When the Soviet Union fell at the end of 1991, its last member was the Kazakhstan Soviet. The UN Charter in 1945 made the Soviet Union one of the the Permanent 5 (P5) members of the UN's security council. Why is Russia today one of the P5 when Kazakhstan is clearly the successor of the USSR?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tb0z2i/when_the_soviet_union_fell_at_the_end_of_1991_its/), submitted on 2022-03-10 23:19:31+08:00.

There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

### 216: [Why didn't the British take the Dutch east indies for themselves at the end of the Napoleonic Wars?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tbgtki/why_didnt_the_british_take_the_dutch_east_indies/), submitted on 2022-03-11 11:31:05+08:00.

----- __216.1__ -----2022-03-11 12:02:15+08:00:

Hey there,

Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.

If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, [consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) (rather than why what didn't happen didn't happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!

### 219: [Was there ever a hui or tibetan dynasty?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tcppnt/was_there_ever_a_hui_or_tibetan_dynasty/), submitted on 2022-03-13 04:09:21+08:00.

----- __219.1__ -----2022-03-15 19:54:25+08:00:

This question is one that was perhaps more complicated than you may have imagined while writing it, because it gets into two main areas: matters of ethnic reification and classification, and the 'dynastic cycle'. Because the terms 'Hui', 'Tibetan', and 'dynasty' are less concrete, in a grand historical context, than you might imagine.

### Problems of Ethnicity in Pre-Modern China and Inner Asia

You allude to the idea of there being 'five main races' in China, but this is something with a particular historical context. The idea of 'Five Races Under One Union', encompassing the Han, Manchus, Mongols, Tibetans, and Muslims, was first promulgated around the time of the 1911 Revolution as a means of reconciling nationalist demands for Han majority rule with imperial ambitions of holding on to the Inner Asian regions of the Qing empire. In practical terms, it was short-lived as a political doctrine, as Mongolia and Tibet declared and achieved independence that year and would not be absorbed into the Republic of China (although it did exercise claims to these regions and technically still does). The People's Republic of China, established by the Communists in 1949, defines 56 ethnicities: the Han, and 55 state-designated 'minority ethnicities'. Neither of these classifications has any objective correctness, and both are ultimately Procrustean to some extent or another. The Republican 'Five Races' notably exclude any of the indigenous peoples of southern China, while the Communist method of ethnic classification arbitrarily combines several groups that self-identify in distinct ways, in some cases purely on the basis of a shared character in their Chinese transcriptions rather than any real consideration for indigenous genealogies.

But in turn, these classifications also reflect the scope of a larger 'China' as created by the Qing, whose conquests beyond China Proper established a (mostly) lasting political settlement over large portions of Inner Asia that had not previously been unified under a single state formation. I use 'China' in scare quotes because there was not, and arguably still is not, a single term in the Chinese languages that corresponds to the relatively vague English use of the term. 'China' can be defined as a geographical space, a cultural space, or as a political entity. The Republic of China and People's Republic of China have long had a certain interest in enabling that vagary in order to justify their existence as being nation-states, rather than as empires, claiming large parts of Inner Asia that had been outside the scope of historic Chinese empires into the geographic and cultural space of 'China', on the retroactive basis of their current political scope. Take for example Tibet. Historically, Tibet was never geographically or administratively part of 'China' as such before the Communist conquest and annexation in 1951 – while it had been part of the Mongol Yuan and Manchu Qing empires, in neither case was its administrative structure subordinated to or brought in line with the Chinese provinces.

That is not to say that Tibetans or Muslims did not have a significant place in the Qing Empire. Whether the Republicans realised it or not, they were in essence attempting to codify an informal understanding that had developed in the Qing imperial court in the late 18th century, that being what Pamela Crossley terms 'constituencies' and what James Millward calls 'blocs' – Manchu, Han, Mongol, Tibetan, and Muslim. The issue is actually quite complex and theory-heavy – Crossley's 'constituencies' are ideological concepts and not actual people, whereas Millward's 'ethnic or linguistic blocs' (reframed by Emma Teng as 'culture blocs') are actual groups of people, at least as construed by the court – but we need not dig too deep into the weeds here. The main thing is that the idea of Tibetans and Muslims being core ethnic groups in China is and was a product of the eighteenth-century Qing conquests, rather than being rooted in any prior imperial Chinese rhetoric. Indeed, we can extend that to the Manchus and Mongols, whose homelands lay outside the scope of any Han Chinese empires. The Qing conquests enabled the prospect of conceptualising – or at least rhetorically claiming – 'China' as a multiethnic union.

Before moving on it is also important to raise the matter of Muslim identity as classified by imperial and republican Chinese states, because 'Muslim' in the case of the 'Five Races' does not map neatly onto the Hui, a category which itself has a complicated history. Under the Ming, *all* Muslims were referred to as 'Huihui', a corruption of the earlier 'Huihe', a transcription of 'Uighur'. Under the Qing, there was some effort to distinguish between subgroups – the main groups being the Sala Hui in the Kokonor region, Chantou (Turbaned) Hui in Qing Turkestan (now Xinjiang), and Han Hui for Chinese-speaking Muslims, located primarily in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Yunnan. The broad-brush use of 'Hui' to designate all Muslims in the empire was retained in 1911, but fell out of use during the Republican period as Muslim identities in Inner Asia, especially that of the Uighurs, solidified, leading to 'Hui' becoming a term specifically for Sinophone Muslims in China Proper by the time of the PRC's founding, and becoming reified as such by its minority policy. In effect, then, 'the Hui' as an ethnic group, as understood today (that is, Sinophone Muslims), did not exist during the imperial period.

### Problems of the 'Dynastic Cycle'

The periodisation of Chinese history as a series of 'dynasties' is, for many reasons, problematic, as I discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4uur3/did_the_various_ruling_dynasties_of_china_ever/hsv34aa/?context=999). One of the major problems with a dynastic-centric periodisation is a paradoxical effect on how change and continuity are perceived: there is often a presumption that a 'dynastic transition' implies substantial political changes, but that in the broad sweep there is little effect on the underlying state structures of 'China'. But another issue, one much more relevant to your query, is that there is a sort of 'there can be only one' problem when it comes to the imperial claim: the history of imperial China gets presented as a bit of a relay race where the torch is passed from one singular 'dynasty' to the next at discrete points in time, with the occasional mess of squabbling states such as the Northern and Southern and the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. The problem is that these states did not conceive of themselves as simply inheriting each other's mantles; nor did they see themselves as coming into existence at the moment that their 'predecessor's' existence ceased. To cite just one case, the Qing were founded in 1636 nearly a decade before the fall of the Ming proper in 1644, yet remnants of the Ming court and its loyalists continued to operate as the 'Southern Ming' until (nominally) 1683, while several rebel states, most prominently the Great Shun, also made claims on the imperial title.

The most substantial elision resulting from this 'relay race' model is that the period between the end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms in 960 and the establishment of the Yuan in 1271 often gets referred to as 'the Song', despite the fact that the Song themselves never actually controlled all of China proper: to the northeast, the Khitan-established Great Liao held several areas of historically Han settlement, including the Liaodong region and what is now northern Hebei (the region around Beijing); they would be usurped by the Jurchen-established Jin, which went further by conquering all of China north of the Huai river and driving the Song to the south; to the northwest, after a brief period of Song dominion the Tanguts revolted in 984 and eventually established the state of Western Xia in Gansu in 1038. Western Xia was, for all intents and purposes, the weakest of the three states, and would be the first to fall to the Mongols, but it nevertheless exercised a claim to imperial status. In the traditional chronology, and even in the modern trend for referring to 960-1271 as the 'Song-Liao-Jin' period, Western Xia is rather unceremoniously cast aside.

### Summaries and Conclusions

I bring up Western Xia because in a sense, it is a decent candidate for being a 'Tibetan dynasty' as phrased in the question, but there is a reason I say a decent candidate and not a definite contender. The Tanguts had a relatively long history of entanglement with Tibet, but from a linguistic standpoint they are relatively distant, with Tangut being part of the Eastern rather than the Western Tibeto-Burman family and thus arguably closer to modern Burmese than modern standard Tibetan. More importantly, 'Tibetan' as an identity was not universally accepted by those living in what we would now call Tibet, as the territorial extent of Tibet waxed and waned considerably over the course of its history, with perhaps the most substantial waxing taking place during Qing rule/patronage/whatever you want to call it. In effect, we run into the problem from the first section again: ethnic identities cannot simply be retrojected back through time as though they have existed forever, let alone been unchanged forever.

So, have there ever been Hui or Tibetan dynasties of China? No, firstly because 'Hui' and 'Tibetan' as identities are more recent than they may first appear, and secondly because Tibetans in particular were not a substantial part of 'China' in any meaningful sense until arguably the Yuan and more concretely the Qing (and even if you count the Yuan they were not part of the Ming). Moreover, the 'dynastic' classification breaks down once you get in the weeds a bit, and is just an unhelpful method of categorisation except in the broadest strokes.
