    The Hidden Structure of the Apple Keynote

   . His analysis covered 27 events since 2007, and included things like average length, laughs per executive, and the timing of iPhone reveals.

   It’s a good read, but in light of the Watch introduction, I am more interested in comparing yesterday’s keynote to only three others: the introductions of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Specifically, I’m interested in the exact moment when Apple revealed each device:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The iPod was introduced on October 23, 2001; after discussing iLife and Apple digital hub strategy, the iPod section begins at 11:30. However, the iPod itself does not actually appear on a slide until 20:48, and Jobs pulls it out of his pocket at 21:07, nearly 10 minutes after he begins his introduction. The intervening 10 minutes were spent explaining the music market, why Apple thought they could succeed in that market, and what was special about the iPod
   </li>
  </ul>

    The iPhone was introduced on January 9, 2007. However, the iPhone itself does not actually appear on a slide until 7:03, and only then to introduce multitouch. The rest of the device wasn’t seen until 12:20. Jobs spent all of that time explaining the smartphone market, why Apple thought they could succeed in that market, and what was special about the iPhone
   </li>
  </ul>

    The iPad was introduced on January 27, 2010. After a few updates, the iPad section begins at 5:15. However, the iPad itself does not actually appear on a slide until 8:55. Jobs spent the intervening time explaining that Apple saw a market between the iPhone and the Mac, but that any device that played there needed to be better than either device at a few specific use cases
   </li>
