Submission Statement: In this op-ed, Garry Kasparov examines the impact of European willingness to conduct business as usual in the face of Vladimir Putin's aggression.  Kasparov outlines the blatant, obvious warning signs that went ignored much the same way similar warning signs were ignored in the early 20th century by another despot seeking lebensraum.  Despite these unmitigated failures, Kasparov outlines a path forward to mitigate foreseeable harm of Western failures of leadership.
