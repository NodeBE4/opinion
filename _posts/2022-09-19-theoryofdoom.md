### 380: [Does anyone listen to the band Vundabar?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/xi0a4y/does_anyone_listen_to_the_band_vundabar/), submitted on 2022-09-19 11:11:34+08:00.

----- __380.1__ -----2022-09-19 11:38:06+08:00:

No, but it's almost like Vampire Weekend met Bo Burnham.

----- __380.2__ -----2022-09-19 11:56:02+08:00:

haha is that a good thing or a bad thing?

----- __380.3__ -----2022-09-19 12:01:49+08:00:

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIB9Y4OFPs&ab_channel=DEFLEPPARD) is more along the lines of what I'd go for.  

Maybe it will appear on Stranger Things, like other [great 80s music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM&ab_channel=KateBushMusic) recently has.

----- __380.4__ -----2022-09-19 12:12:48+08:00:

Well, everything that's old is new again since today's kiddos have never heard of anything that played before Justin Bieber.  So they're literally just hearing it for the first time.

Meanwhile I grew up on hair metal and all the rest of the best of the 1980s.

----- __380.5__ -----2022-09-19 12:18:26+08:00:

I've only seen them live once.  But it was a fkn great show.  

When I watched the new season of Karate Kid on Netflix, it occurred to me that Johnny's taste in music is really close to my own . . . and that Johnny's music taste is a meme.  But fuck it.  I grew up on [this stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RIeycixkK8&ab_channel=RHINO).  Wish music like this could still be made.

----- __380.6__ -----2022-09-19 20:40:19+08:00:

Right on.  We all need a little hair metal in our lives.  Or a lot.

So you say.

### 382: [Which song do you identify 100%? I mean word by word](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/xilqiz/which_song_do_you_identify_100_i_mean_word_by_word/), submitted on 2022-09-20 03:15:21+08:00.

----- __382.1__ -----2022-09-20 10:44:51+08:00:

It's a toss up between [New Dawn Fades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j5LmyNNsrE&ab_channel=JoyDivision-Topic) and [Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Ew6UVFR-I&ab_channel=JoyDivision-Topic) by Joy Division.  

Really, Ian Curtis's lyrics are closer to me than any others that any other band has ever written.  

And yes.  Both of these speak to me 100%.  Word, by every single word.   

Here are the lyrics to New Dawn Fades:

> A change of speed, a change of style
> 
> A change of scene, with no regrets
> 
> A chance to watch, admire the distance
>
> 
> Still occupied, though you forget
> 
> Different colors, different shades
> 
> Over each mistakes were made
> 
> I took the blame
> 
>
> Directionless, so plain to see
> 
> A loaded gun won't set you free
> 
> So you say
> 
>
> We'll share a drink and step outside
> 
> An angry voice and one who cried
> 
>
> We'll give you everything and more
> 
> The strain's too much, can't take much more
> 
>
> Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire
> 
> Can't seem to feel it anymore
> 
>
> It was me, waiting for me
> 
> Hoping for something more
>
> 
> Me, seeing me this time
> 
> Hoping for something else
> 

Here are the lyrics to Ceremony:

> This is why events unnerve me,
> 
> They find it all, a different story,
> 
> 
> Notice whom for wheels are turning,
> 
> Turn again and turn towards this time,
> 
> 
> All she ask's the strength to hold me,
> 
> Then again the same old story,
> 
> 
> Word will travel, oh so quickly,
> 
> Travel first and lean towards this time.
> 
> 
> Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,
> 
> Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,
> 
> 
> Watching her, these things she said,
> 
> The times she cried,
> 
> 
> Too frail to wake this time.
> 
> 
> Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,
> 
> Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,
> 
> 
> Avenues all lined with trees,
> 
> Picture me and then you start watching,
> 
> 
> Watching forever, forever,
> 
> Watching love grow, forever,
> 
> 
> Letting me know, forever.
> 

Note.  People dispute what the actual lyrics are that Ian Curtis wrote versus what New Order rewrote.  This is the Universal Music Publishing Group copyrighted version.  There are slight differences in what Ian Curtis wrote in his Black & Red notebook, copies of which I have sitting on my shelf. Maybe if I get super motivated, I'll type those up.

----- __383.2__ -----2022-09-20 10:23:27+08:00:

And somehow you failed to include [Livin' on a Prayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lmzY8iIhg&ab_channel=ChinosLs) from 1987.  What gives?

----- __383.3__ -----2022-09-20 10:30:37+08:00:

> Abacab 1981

Come on.  If you're going to link Genesis, get [the best Genesis that's there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAH3dLmqk5I&ab_channel=STAGES).  

Now the ball is in your court to find the best live version of Red Rain.

----- __383.4__ -----2022-09-20 10:47:52+08:00:

Well.  Then you get a pass.  This time.  

I can't remember if No Son of Mine was from the 80s or not.  

If it was, it should be added.

----- __383.5__ -----2022-09-20 10:48:29+08:00:

> I hate Bon Jovi

Blasphemy.

----- __383.6__ -----2022-09-20 10:51:24+08:00:

I raise Safety Dance with [Talking Heads - Once in a Lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGofoH9RDEA&ab_channel=RonaldRock). 

But you know what?  The [music video is just as good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8&ab_channel=TalkingHeads).

----- __383.7__ -----2022-09-20 10:53:21+08:00:

Literally everyone knows [Shout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEHCChS7fBI&ab_channel=SelmaSonderlich) beats Everyone Wants to Rule the World.

### 384: [Got "Permently Banned" from r/Forex...](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/xmbpob/got_permently_banned_from_rforex/), submitted on 2022-09-24 06:46:29+08:00.

degeneracy at its finest

----- __384.3__ -----2022-09-27 10:45:10+08:00:

It's like playing no limit hold 'em, every day of your life, where you don't even get to pick up your cards.

----- __384.4__ -----2022-09-27 10:45:32+08:00:

That's what drugs are for.

----- __384.5__ -----2022-09-27 10:47:32+08:00:

> P/L Porn" posts (also a nono) featuring thier oil profits and losses.

ROFLMAO I love this.  Although I have always thought of this more like high school boys measuring themselves in the locker room.
