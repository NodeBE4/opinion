<p>Last September I announced that a Stratechery subscription was being rebranded to Stratechery Plus, and launched a new podcast: <a href="https://sharptech.fm/member">Sharp Tech with Ben Thompson</a>. Sharp Tech joined the <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/daily-email/">Stratechery Update</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">Stratechery Interviews</a>, and <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> to form the Stratechery Plus bundle.</p><p>In November Stratechery Plus added <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/stratechery-plus-adds-sharp-china-with-sinocisms-bill-bishop/">Sharp China with Bill Bishop</a>, a collaboration with Bill Bishop of <a href="https://sinocism.com/">Sinocism</a>. I am pleased that every podcast in the Stratechery Plus bundle has over 10,000 paid listeners, and thousands of more listeners on the free feeds, which feature clips and occasional full episodes.</p><p>Today I am excited to announce that the Stratechery Plus bundle is expanding in a fun new direction with the addition of <a href="https://goat.passport.online/member">Greatest of All Talk</a>, a podcast about basketball, life, and national parks:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="The Greatest Of All Talk joins Stratechery Plus" width="640" height="640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10311" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?resize=630%2C630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goat-podcast-cover-plus.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p><p>My initial relationship with my <a href="https://sharptech.fm/">Sharp Tech</a> co-host Andrew Sharp was a one-way one: I was an ardent listener of the Sports Illustrated Open Floor podcast he hosted with fellow writer <a href="https://twitter.com/BenGolliver">Ben Golliver</a>. Open Floor was both quirky and knowledgable, with the sort of conversational tone I like in podcasts, and it rewarded loyal listeners with ongoing gags and inside jokes.</p><p>Fast forward a couple of years — at which point I had had the chance to become real-life friends with Sharp — and new Sports Illustrated owner Maven <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/03/766929743/new-owners-of-sports-illustrated-set-massive-layoffs-journalists-rebel">laid off half of the staff</a>, including Sharp, which meant the end of my favorite podcast. That&#8217;s when I had the chance to meet Golliver, and pushed the two of them to launch an independent for-pay podcast called <a href="https://greatestofalltalk.com/">The Greatest Of All Talk</a>, or GOAT for short. That was four years ago, and the GOAT became my new favorite podcast, for all of the same reasons — but now with no ads, and a thriving community to boot.</p><p>Over that period Sharp left journalism for the law, but when he decided he wanted to come back to media, I jumped at the opportunity to work with him here at Stratechery, first on Sharp Tech, and then Sharp China. And now, to bring things full circle, I&#8217;m thrilled to add GOAT to the Stratechery Plus bundle. If you like basketball, acerbic humor, great chemistry, and the reward of being a loyal listener, GOAT is, well, a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=goat">GOAT-level</a> podcast.</p><p>A quick note for anyone who is already a GOAT-listener: GOAT will remain an independent entity that listeners can subscribe to directly; however, it is now available to all Stratechery Plus subscribers as well. If you are a subscriber to both and don&#8217;t want to double-pay, you can cancel your subscription on GOAT&#8217;s <a href="https://goat.supportingcast.fm/request_access">hosting service</a> and add <a href="https://goat.passport.online/">a new feed on Passport</a>. If you&#8217;re a subscriber to neither, there is no better time to <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">subscribe</a> for just $12/month.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the show as much as I do.</p>
