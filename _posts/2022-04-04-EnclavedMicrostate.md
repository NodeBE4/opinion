I feel like it's more likely it was the 'Calvin Morrison' stuff she did for April Fools that was shared than the old pre-Calli stuff that she's disavowed.

> Aaaand the third reason, INNK wasn't always fully owned by Cover. It was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8. But Upd8 dissolved after poor management practices were made public, so Cover came into full ownership of INNK.

This is something I've seen a lot, but I legitimately cannot find any firm evidence to support it, and in fact a lot against:

1. AZKi debuted under Upd8 several weeks before officially starting with INNK.

2. Suisei was never affiliated with Upd8 during her time with INNK.

3. While Upd8 dissolved, its parent company, Activ8, still exists, and it wouldn't make sense for Upd8, the sub-company within Activ8, to have had a stake in INNK that wouldn't be transferred to Activ8 if it was wound up.

The trouble is that the sentence 'INNK was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8' gets repeated a lot, but I've never seen anything to confirm this is actually true and not just an assumption that was made. As far as I can tell, INNK was always under Cover, and AZKi as an individual talent was under Cover but also an Upd8 affiliate (in the vein of HoneyStrap and AniMare being part of 774 but represented by Upd8), but INNK as a whole was not, hence Suisei being Cover-only.

[Ayame's last birthday live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7OaRnM9-A) was mostly group performances; Nene, Towa, and Suisei did a [Christmas concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVQQcI6r3NU) as a trio; more recently both [Suisei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHf9Tmdvpk) and [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrcZEjdrkRg) have done 3D Lives featuring each other, and Calli also featured Rikka from Holostars.
