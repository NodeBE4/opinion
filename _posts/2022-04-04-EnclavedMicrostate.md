### 300: [forget.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/tw02pz/forget/), submitted on 2022-04-04 19:49:24+08:00.

----- __300.1__ -----2022-04-04 22:12:35+08:00:

I feel like it's more likely it was the 'Calvin Morrison' stuff she did for April Fools that was shared than the old pre-Calli stuff that she's disavowed.

### 301: [Question about the Universal Music deal for Calli](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tw2v5n/question_about_the_universal_music_deal_for_calli/), submitted on 2022-04-04 22:06:24+08:00.

> Aaaand the third reason, INNK wasn't always fully owned by Cover. It was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8. But Upd8 dissolved after poor management practices were made public, so Cover came into full ownership of INNK.

This is something I've seen a lot, but I legitimately cannot find any firm evidence to support it, and in fact a lot against:

1. AZKi debuted under Cover a few weeks before also being affiliated with Upd8, and it would be several more weeks before officially starting with INNK.

2. Suisei was never affiliated with Upd8 during her time with INNK.

3. While Upd8 dissolved, its parent company, Activ8, still exists, and it wouldn't make sense for Upd8, the sub-company within Activ8, to have had a stake in INNK that wouldn't be transferred to Activ8 if it was wound up.

The trouble is that the sentence 'INNK was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8' gets repeated a lot, but I've never seen anything to confirm this is actually true and not just an assumption that was made. As far as I can tell, INNK was always under Cover, and AZKi as an individual talent was under Cover but also an Upd8 affiliate (in the vein of HoneyStrap and AniMare being part of 774 but represented by Upd8), but INNK as a whole was not, hence Suisei being Cover-only.

### 302: [Are there any sources on the contemporary opinions of the Chinese concerning the Taiping Rebellion? (Amidst its heyday and subsequent defeat) Were they sympathetic or unsympathetic?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tw3xlj/are_there_any_sources_on_the_contemporary/), submitted on 2022-04-04 22:52:04+08:00.

----- __302.1__ -----2022-04-09 01:56:37+08:00:

I have had this question on the backburner for a while and I do wish to come back to it and write a full answer when I can; that said a lot of the scholarship relevant to it I read literally years ago and cannot recall in substantial detail at present and would need to go back over from near- scratch. In *general*, civilian responses to and reflections on the Taiping War related to the general depredations of the conflict itself and less to the ideological dimensions of the Taiping cause, but Confucian elites did tend towards a stronger ideological critique at the same time. A past Tuesday Trivia post of mine focussing on the case of Zhang Guanglie, who was a child during the war and whose mother was killed during a siege, can be found [here](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/al16kd/tuesday_trivia_how_did_people_in_your_era_deal/efaqih2/?context=999) 

However, while you wait for me to get my act together, I do have a few reading suggestions:

* Tobie Meyer-Fong, *What Remains* – This is basically the book to read that answers your question most directly; it discusses civilian perspectives on the conflict from a variety of angles. Also see her review of the 2013 translation of Zhang Daye's *The World of a Tiny Insect*, another memoir of a civilian survivor of the war.

* Indeed, Zhang Daye's *The World of a Tiny Insect*, translated by Tian Xiaofei, would be a good read in itself, if contextualised alongside Meyer-Fong's book.

* Jin Huan's article 'Stitching Words to Suture Wounds' discusses the diary of Shen Zi during the Taiping War, albeit more as a literary work than as a source on broader civilian perspectives.

* Chuck Wooldridge's *City of Virtues* includes a chapter on the period of the occupation of Nanjing and elite responses thereof.

### 303: [Zero Zombie Zones - Weekly Discussion Thread, April 4th, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/tw8djd/zero_zombie_zones_weekly_discussion_thread_april/), submitted on 2022-04-05 01:54:21+08:00.

----- __303.1__ -----2022-04-05 02:11:46+08:00:

[Ayame's last birthday live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7OaRnM9-A) was mostly group performances; Nene, Towa, and Suisei did a [Christmas concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVQQcI6r3NU) as a trio; more recently both [Suisei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHf9Tmdvpk) and [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrcZEjdrkRg) have done 3D Lives featuring each other, and Calli also featured Rikka from Holostars.

----- __303.2__ -----2022-04-06 14:14:27+08:00:

Interesting choice of Bae as a point of comparison...

----- __303.3__ -----2022-04-10 18:24:21+08:00:

I have very little stake in the HoloCN drama specifically, but I do feel like it's not *that* unreasonable that if you hire 5 or 6 young Chinese women (IIRC one was actually Taiwanese) then you'll have *at least* one vocal nationalist who might put national loyalty above basically anything else.

----- __303.4__ -----2022-04-10 19:08:07+08:00:

Accent, I believe.

----- __303.5__ -----2022-04-11 02:39:41+08:00:

Speaking for myself as a HK-native, from what clips I've heard she seems to have had a Guangzhou accent in Cantonese, though to be fair that's not necessarily a big indicator either way.

### 304: [So yeah, I guess Funimation is just being fed alive to Crunchyroll](https://old.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/tx043d/so_yeah_i_guess_funimation_is_just_being_fed/), submitted on 2022-04-06 01:22:53+08:00.

----- __304.1__ -----2022-04-06 14:24:51+08:00:

Is the rice company one Mai Princess (which is actually a trio although one of them streams very rarely) or is there a *different* rice-themed VTuber? Although as for the weather forecasting one, that's been around for a *long* time, even before Kizuna AI, but was originally a pseudo-Vocaloid rather than a live performance.

----- __304.2__ -----2022-04-06 14:26:52+08:00:

Not really, to be honest. At Hololive the VTubers *are* the idols, but it's the only significant agency with a heavy idol aesthetic. The other two major agencies (Nijisanji and VShojo) don't do the idol thing at all, nor do the vast majority of relatively established mid-tier agencies like 774 or VSpo. There are some music-heavy VTubers but that's relatively normal given a lot of them have backgrounds as utaite.

----- __304.3__ -----2022-04-06 22:09:01+08:00:

If it's Mai Princess then I feel like they're the least effective company mascots ever, because I watch Milky Queen semi-frequently and still have no idea what company they're mascots for, if they even are.

----- __304.4__ -----2022-04-08 04:54:33+08:00:

That's not quite correct. While technically, Nijisanji is a division of Anycolor Inc. and Hololive is a division of COVER Corporation, these were companies set up as VTuber companies in 2017/18 whose other subdivisions are essentially nominal.

### 305: [So....what's up with Omega?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tx7bym/sowhats_up_with_omega/), submitted on 2022-04-06 06:45:39+08:00.

----- __305.1__ -----2022-04-06 11:18:51+08:00:

Given that Omega didn't even promote 3rd Fes I feel like the whole thing is on somewhat of a backburner now. My largely speculative take is that Omega was supposed to ultimately serve as EN's A-Chan, serving as a visible producer/director, but I think it went wrong for a few reasons:

1. While Omega was introduced along with Council, that did leave their position as regards Myth a little weird and open. Whereas A-Chan was there basically from the start and organically part of Hololive, building up Omega as this big producer/director figure for the whole of EN was kind of retcon-y almost because no such figure seems to have ever existed for Myth.

2. The focus on design and lore seemed just a bit extra. As characters, A-Chan, and more recently Nodoka, are supposed to just be normal humans working at Hololive, while Omega's whole 'divine being' status and elaborate character design all seem almost a bit tacky. I suspect a related issue is that there ends up being somewhat of a lore-specific power dynamic, i.e. Omega as a godlike figure seems to be decidedly more 'powerful' lore-wise than EN's members, whereas A-Chan and Nodoka are on the same level as the JP Holomems image-wise.

3. I legitimately don't think people were wholly receptive to an overtly non-feminine presence in HoloEN. Omega being gender-neutral but also occasionally alluded to in masculine terms I think did actually put people off who had seen HoloEN as a primarily female group. Optimistically there might be an image element to it related to the above: it might come across as a *little* iffy for the talent section to be all women, and the only known producer/director figure to not be. But if you want to blame idol culture I don't think I could say it wasn't part of it.

4. The way HoloEN appears to work, Omega was kind of superfluous. HoloEN, not unreasonably, has somewhat of an image of being self-organising to a great extent among the talents. Myth, IRyS, Council, and ID Gen 2 all started mixing and doing their own thing pretty quickly. 'A-Chan wrangles everyone into the studio' makes sense in context, 'Omega wrangles EN into doing a collab' does not.

----- __305.2__ -----2022-04-06 13:22:15+08:00:

> (considering that a JP manager, Mane-chan, is watching over Bae)

You realise that 'Mane-chan' is simply an abbreviated form of 'Manager-chan', right?

----- __305.3__ -----2022-04-06 22:24:27+08:00:

It's worth noting that manager=/=producer/director. A-chan (and presumably Omega, if Omega is indeed just one individual) doesn't actually manage any specific talents, but instead has some kind of higher-level role in planning and organising content, as well as a public-facing role as the 'voice of Hololive' so to speak when it comes to things like news updates or main-channel collabs. She essentially 'speaks for Hololive' as basically a representative of the agency in the abstract. J-Chad, Enma and Jenma, as well as the anonymous Mane-chans for Council and IRyS, aren't public-facing the way A-chan is, because their role is simply managing the EN Holomems on a day-to-day basis. Behind the scenes, whoever Omega is probably has a similar kind of role to A-chan in terms of managing and organising branch-wide activities, and the Omega character would have been there for the purposes of adding in A-chan's other role as the 'face' of Hololive as an agency, just for HoloEN instead of HoloJP.

Which actually leads me to the thought that a fifth reason why Omega's been sidelined is that A-chan's written English is pretty good, even if it may be run past a copy editor before anything is posted, so in a sense, there's even less point in having a specifically EN producer Twitter account for interactions if A-chan is now capable of handling EN Twitter interactions.

----- __305.4__ -----2022-04-06 22:27:43+08:00:

To be fair, A-chan has had a 3d model since July 2018 and Live2D since February 2019; it's just she's appeared with them more frequently as of late.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

While true of sedentary societies, pastoral nomads have historically been far easier to mobilise – Nikolai Kradin estimates around 75% of the adult male population in a pastoral society could be put under arms without compromising food production. If one quarter of the population was male adults, 75% of that would be just under 19%, so close enough. Of course, do have to assume for that a) that the adult male population was indeed around 25%, and b) that the Khwarezmian population was overwhelmingly pastoral nomadic; on the latter count I don't personally know what the demographic division between sedentary and pastoral populations may have been.

Before getting into the meat of my comment I do just want to say big ups for a great answer! What I'm highlighting here is not a problem with the answer itself but rather one of its sources:

> One explanation offered by Andrade was that military innovation and evolution quickened during periods of intense warfare and thus the degradation of East Asian military capabilities could attributed to the long periods of relative peace that predominated East Asia after the wars which marked the Ming-Qing transition.

Interesting as Andrade's thesis is on this count, I would note that there are some reasonable objections to it. Namely, Andrade chooses the conclusion of the Zunghar campaigns ca. 1759 as the cutoff point for Qing military activity, but as recent work by Ulrich Theobald has shown, the logistical mobilisation for the Second Jinchuan War in the 1770s was quite substantial in itself, and Dai Yingcong's recent history of the White Lotus Rebellion has similarly highlighted the scale of military conflict here. What is perhaps less easy to excuse is the overlooking of the quite substantial Burmese and Vietnamese debacles in which the Qing expended quite extraordinary resources; the former of these had already been written about by Dai back in 2004.

I suspect part of why Andrade felt so confident making his case, besides a simple lack of then-extant research into the wars of the later Qianlong reign, was his misreading of Peter Perdue's work on the Zunghar wars and perhaps the Military Revolution thesis in and of itself. While the Military Revolution thesis does seek to explain military change, as originally conceived this was as a means of explaining *political and societal change* first and foremost, as you note at the start of your answer. A particular passage from Perdue that Andrade cites as arguing that innovation in military *technology* resulted from the Zunghar wars is, on closer inspection, an argument that military *institutions* saw substantial expansion and reform, not because the Zunghar wars presented a particular tactical challenge, but rather a logistical one that necessitated substantial increases in state investment in support infrastructure for large field armies.

In effect, my beef with Andrade's formulation of the 'Great Qing Peace' is that it requires presuming that the Zunghar wars were necessarily seen as unique in the Qing official mind, and that the end of those wars meant the end of serious military engagement in general, when some of the largest campaigns undertaken by the Qing would come about decades later.

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

We ought not to act as though Hong Kong's local authorities are incapable of making bad decisions. To be quite honest, a lot of the extremes of COVID policy in China, both in Hong Kong and on the mainland, have been the result of the *lack* of a coherent central strategy. Local authorities at various levels have been more or less winging it, in part because COVID cases have, until recently, been so low that there have been more resources built up, that have in turn been spent on much more severe interventions. The hamster cull wasn't a case of 'Beijing came for your pets', it was a case of 'HK local authorities, with a lot of resources but still very low case numbers to have to deal with, trying to look like they're doing something really important.'

----- __331.1__ -----2022-04-10 17:52:33+08:00:

Taiping theology is a pretty well-studied topic, though the older of a work you look at, generally the less good it is. The things to read, in descending order, would be:

* Carl Kilcourse, *Taiping Theology* (2017)

* Thomas Reilly, *The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Religion and the Blasphemy of Empire* (2004)

* Rudolf Wagner, *Re-enacting the Heavenly Vision* (1984)

* Vincent Shih, *The Taiping Ideology* (1967)

* Eugene Boardman, *Christian Influence Upon the Ideology of the Taiping Rebellion* (1971)

As for translated works, nearly the entire corpus of then-extant Taiping documents was translated by a team from the University of California back in the late 1960s, and published in 1971 as the second and third volumes of *The Taiping Rebellion: Documents and Comments*.

----- __331.2__ -----2022-04-10 18:17:09+08:00:

No problem! I would stress that the last two books on there need to be read with a grain of salt, as both are attempts – for differing reasons – to dispel the notion of the Taiping as 'real' Christians. Shih's main focus is locating Confucian influences in Taiping policies and manifestoes, while Boardman, a practicing Quaker, saw the Taiping's ostensible Old Testament focus and general violence as disqualifying them from his personal, denominationally-influenced definition of Christianity. Kilcourse, Reilly, and Wagner offer more rounded views.

> Hong Kong is overrun

I'd amend that to 'has been overrun'; cases peaked at the beginning of March but tailed off relatively quickly and we're back at 4-digit daily case numbers and falling (plus there's just been a 3-day citywide mass test which actually hasn't turned up *that* many more cases than were being reported already). That said, basically one in every seven people caught Omicron, and we've had nearly 9000 deaths which, while not a lot compared to some places, is still 9000 too many in one way or another.

It's also worth adding that 'zero covid policy' can manifest very differently in different places. For instance, HK never went under any form of strict lockdown, even during this Omicron wave. Zero-covid has been less the name of a singular strategy and more of a target, one reached mainly through *comparatively* limited distancing measures (escalated as necessary) and contact tracing.

----- __333.1__ -----2022-04-11 19:25:30+08:00:

> >!recently and suddenly fired for breaking NDA!<

While a common statement, I've never seen firm evidence that it was an NDA that was broken, or more specifically, that it was the disclosure aspect of the contract. As it stands, Cover has not and likely will not ever disclose the exact nature of the contract breaches.

----- __333.2__ -----2022-04-11 20:26:49+08:00:

In the most pedantic terms, an NDA is an agreement not to disclose *the terms of the agreement itself*. Now, those terms will typically include other information not to be disclosed and therefore come under the NDA's purview, but not *every* leak is a violation of the non-disclosure clauses of a non-disclosure agreement; there can be other forms of contract violation involving leaks of information not otherwise covered in direct terms by an NDA.

To put it another way, an NDA is an agreement not to disclose *specific* information to a third party, but it is theoretically possible to leak information not covered by that specific agreement but still violate contract in doing so if there are other terms on communications. It's true that it was *probably* an NDA clause violated, but because that specific language was not used, I think there is reason enough to suggest that it is not 100% clear that it was the non-disclosure element of the contract that was violated, and that it should not be stated with unequivocal certainty.

----- __333.3__ -----2022-04-11 20:49:52+08:00:

To quote The Big Lebowski, 'that's just like your opinion, man.' The VTuber community tends to latch on to very specific language and talking points where the basis in fact is reasonable but not definitive, and I prefer to push back on it when I see it. As stated, Cover did not specify if it was the formal non-disclosure clause that Rushia violated, and that being the case it is not correct to state unequivocally that it was.

----- __333.4__ -----2022-04-12 02:42:02+08:00:

I mean, that's the whole mess with Mikeneko/>!Rushia!<, isn't it? Cover was in a way extraordinarily kind in being relatively vague about the precise circumstances of the leaks and their specific implications vis-a-vis her contract, but that has opened up the possibility of both hardcore fans defending absolutely everything on her part and blaming everything on Cover, *and* hardcore antis blaming absolutely everything on her.

----- __333.5__ -----2022-04-12 02:50:58+08:00:

A bit of an update to this situation because it is pertinent, but I do want to issue a content warning in advance. It has since come out that the alleged fan trying to buy the Genshin account was actually an anti who was deliberately stirring shit for Mikeneko, allegedly (TW now) >!'until she kills herself'!<. This is based on screencaps of in-game DMs with said user, with the originals posted on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/soukyuu_813/status/1513490080198901760?s=21&t=5SCsZCOa7M2lcrCke-yVrw).

----- __333.6__ -----2022-04-12 16:02:42+08:00:

The [initial top-level](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/u0jd14/hobby_scuffles_week_of_april_11_2022/i49sik1/) discussing this drama is now collapsed due to downvotes so, even though that comment is less than 24 hours old, I feel like the update ought to come as a new top-level comment, and I suppose I will be laying the groundwork all over again. A Japanese streamer going by Mikeneko, who recently re-emerged after a relatively long hiatus from active content creation, has been somewhat of a locus for drama of late, primarily because – and this is spoilered out for reasons of etiquette – >!She was, from July 2019 to February 2022, the person behind Hololive 3rd Generation's Uruha Rushia, until her contract was terminated over incidents where she leaked internal information to third parties.!< Much of the drama in February and March has had to do with that, and arguments over degrees of fault at various levels have gone every which way in that time. That being said, however much blame she may or may not deserve, it seems worth stating for the record that outright harassment over the affair was not, is not, and will not ever be justified.

While there were a couple of incidents in late February and early March, Mikeneko has genuinely managed to avoid instigating controversy for a couple of weeks now, which some have attributed in part to her having been reached out to by a number of former colleagues, particularly kson and possibly also Delutaya. (Again, spoilered for etiquette: >!kson was formerly Kiryu Coco, who inadvertently instigated [the 'Taiwan Incident'](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/jjkyoc/virtual_youtuber_the_hololive_taiwan_controversy/) at Cover/Hololive in late 2020 and who retired on amicable terms in July 2021; Delutaya was formerly Mano Aloe, who [retired very shortly after debut](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/jeui8v/virtual_youtubers_her_name_was_mano_aloe_a_fan/) due to a social media hate mob.!<) That said it's also quite probable that she herself has calmed down and come to terms with things a lot on her own, so that's good, and she's slowly getting back into streaming with relatively little in the way of fresh controversy.

This all changed in the last couple of days, a little after Mikeneko announced she would be playing Genshin Impact on stream. Here's what ostensibly happened next: a Genshin player under the username Neko, who claimed to be a Mikeneko fan, approached another player named Nanase, asking about buying an account off them. Neko's tone was apparently quite rude, and subsequently Nanase Tweeted out screencaps of the conversation stating that they had heard of multiple Genshin players being approached by Mikeneko fans to buy their accounts, and posting the screencaps as a warning. Said Tweet was tagged with the hashtag for Mikeneko, and in that classic social media game of telephone, this led to some believing that Mikeneko herself was trying to buy people's accounts, when what Nanase seemed to be suggesting was simply that Mikeneko *fans* were trying to buy accounts in advance of her playing the game. This, of course, led to Genshin players harassing Mikeneko. In turn, Mikeneko fans asked Nanase to retract their statements, but while they apologised for using the hashtag they stated that they would only take down the Tweets if specifically requested to by Mikeneko.

Mikeneko's immediate response could have been better. She did QRT the original Tweet by Nanase asking for it to be taken down, but she also posted and quickly deleted a couple of somewhat flippant Tweets vaguely alluding to the situation that, surprise surprise, drew the ire of more antis. However, she also alleged that her unwillingness to take Nanase seriously came about because they had themselves been somewhat of a Mikeneko anti in the past. Put a pin in that.

What has since come out, per [this thread in Japanese](https://twitter.com/soukyuu_813/status/1513490080198901760?s=21&t=5SCsZCOa7M2lcrCke-yVrw), with a summary [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/u13r10/%E3%81%AE%E3%82%93%E3%81%B3%E3%82%8A_%E4%BA%BA%E9%96%93_%E6%85%B0%E3%82%81_weekly_discussion_thread_april_11th/i4b4phk/) on the VirtualYoutubers subreddit, is that the 'Neko' account was almost certainly part of a ring of Mikeneko antis based on Discord. Their end goal was, in their own words, to deliberately stir up drama for Mikeneko to the point where (major TW ahead) >!she would kill herself!<. Subsequently, Mikeneko [issued a more formal apology](https://twitter.com/95rn16/status/1513620840013004800) in which she asked both for her fans to not take provocative actions but also to ask for them not to also be harassed over the recent happenings. And that might have been the end of that.

Right?

Wrong.

If you were following the earlier Mikeneko drama, then the name Korekore will ring some pretty big bells. Whether these are good or bad bells will depend, but needless to say, when Korekore is involved, things are about to get messy. Whatever his faults, he does seem pretty thorough, and he had apparently noticed that many of the players who had come out with evidence of being approached by Neko and other alleged Mikeneko fans about purchasing accounts had, in fact, previously expressed some level of annoyance over Mikeneko saying she'd be playing. On a stream earlier today, while he didn't state it definitively, he did voice his suspicion that this could not have been pure coincidence, and that there was quite probably some kind of coordinated hoax, with 'Neko' being a sockpuppet of one or more of the Discord antis.

2 hours ago as of writing, Nanase [tweeted a statement](https://twitter.com/nns_kokomi/status/1513758569207775234) in the wake of Korekore's stream stating as follows (translation thanks to /u/_dk):

> About the hoax that I perpetuated mentioned by Korekore's stream:

> The tweets I made about the harassment in Genshin were all staged by myself. I am very sorry.

> I wanted to use Mikeneko-san's name to make a hit tweet. That's the sort of casual feeling I had when I made that tweet. I did not expect the tweet to have such a wide impact, and now I am very sorry for what I did.

> I am truly sorry.  
> I don't think my apology will make this okay.  
> I am truly sorry to Mikeneko-san.  
> To everyone in the Genshin fandom, I am the one most responsible for debasing our conduct and reputation. For that I am sorry.

In other words, the entire thing resulted from a hoax staged by Nanase in which they tried to rile up antis and potentially draw other users into bullying Mikeneko, at the very least out of playing Genshin and potentially far worse.

No, not quite. This was someone posing as a Mikeneko fan but which was inadvertently misinterpreted as Mikeneko having either explicitly or tacitly encouraged fans to buy accounts; in turn, there was a Discord of Mikeneko antis, but it also happens that a number of them are Genshin players. As such, this one person who was a Genshin-playing Mikeneko anti both created a false conversation with their sockpuppet *and* used it to have similar conversations with both other known Genshin-playing antis, and also non-anti Genshin-players, in order to create an air of plausibility and 'organically' create supporters for Nanase.

----- __333.8__ -----2022-04-13 02:31:03+08:00:

You're right, I did phrase the ending statement badly. It's not that Nanase made the whole thing up, just the Neko account.

----- __333.9__ -----2022-04-13 12:03:55+08:00:

I'm very uncomfortable with the narrative that Mikeneko's/>!Rushia's!< hate comes about due to their 'GFE' content at her past job, as it ends up implying a strong degree of victim-blaming. That doesn't mean I don't think she cultivated an unhealthy relationship with her fans, of course, and to quite an extreme degree with some quite extreme actions. It's nevertheless quite plausibly true that there were some people who became antis openly out of a sense of 'betrayal', but there were also plenty of major donors who by and large withheld judgement. I'd argue that most antis are antis for their own sake: they aren't *really* invested in the idea of the person's hypothetical eligibility, they just want a target for their anger and/or malice and will use any excuse to get it.

----- __333.10__ -----2022-04-13 12:13:19+08:00:

The below is purely my own opinion:

So, antis in general will be antis. They don't necessarily care what a person did, they just want to channel their malice at *someone* whom they can construe as having justifiable reasons for stirring up others' hate against. Here, there are a couple of things that make her an easy target. Firstly, simply put there is already a not-inconsiderably degree of built-up antipathy. At first it was the boyfriend drama, which to be frank would be a major issue for *anyone* in her position; then it was the general circumstances around her termination. People know that she tends to react poorly to sudden drama which means anyone trying to get a rise out of her feels like they can do it easily. And now you have the added effect that she no longer has any support in terms of social media management or a company that might back her legally if needs be. It's not that she's necessarily uniquely hateable, it's that she's uniquely vulnerable.

This is a bit of a good news update to [my big post on the early history of VTubers](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/th0gow/virtual_youtubers_the_first_years_of_vtubing/) from last month, although for the sake of new readers I'll be summarising the original affair again for context. Also, I'll have a general vague statement first, and then a more specific one behind spoiler tags, as an etiquette thing.

Back in mid-2019, one of the biggest VTuber channels, second only to Kizuna AI, was Game Club Project, or Game-bu, established under Unlimited Inc. (now rebranded as Brave Group) in March 2018 as part of the first major wave of VTuber projects that started about a year on from AI's debut. Game-bu's conceit was that it was a high school video games club, consisting of four members: Sakuragi Miria, Yumesaki Kaede, Domyoji Haruto, and Kazami Ryo. Unlike modern streaming-focussed VTubers, Game-bu followed the original Kizuna AI mould of producing mostly recorded videos in the 5-20 minute range, mostly featuring individual members but sometimes as a group. Latterly, the four individual members would also operate solo channels to varying levels of activity. Also unlike most modern VTubers who use face-only tracking with Live2D models, Game-bu's members mainly used full-body motion capture with 3D models, again in the mould of the original Kizuna AI.

Game-bu's formula clearly worked given their success, but unfortunately it wasn't just production approaches that were borrowed off Kizuna AI, as Unlimited Inc. also inherited a similar attitude towards the relationship between talent and character. Now, just to forestall anyone complaining, Kizuna AI's original VA, Kasuga Nozomi, wasn't replaced outright in 2019, but she was, from all appearances, *heavily* sidelined by the introduction of additional VAs, and her social media activity suggests that this was not an arrangement she was personally happy with. Game-bu went a step further by outright replacing all four VAs over the course of the summer of 2019, beginning with Miria in June and Haruto in July, and then Kaede and Ryo were recast in September. Unlimited apologised for failing to announce the changes – but not for the changes themselves – and asserted that they were not in fact a VTuber agency but a CTuber (Character Tuber) agency, where they reserved the right to recast the actors behind these characters as they saw fit. This was, needless to say, not taken well, and Game-bu haemorrhaged subscribers and viewers irrecoverably. Game-bu's channel lay dormant after April 2020 but didn't formally dissolve until February 2021, when the (still recast) members did a final sendoff stream; both Miria and Kaede had been active on their solo channels in the interim, but Haruto and Ryo had been effectively silent. Miria was then transferred to a completely separate agency along with another Unlimited/Brave member, Claire Crullen, while the other three characters were retired.

Activ8 had its own set of controversies less immediately relevant here.

Why do I bring this all up? Well, for the original post I got curious enough to look into the later careers of the various talents who had either left or been made to leave their respective agencies during the controversies discussed, in order to write a 'where are they now?' segment. At the time, there had been no real news on Ai-pii (previously Kizuna AI No. 3) or on the three recast Game-bu members besides Miria, and that hasn't changed; I would be willing to guess that all four felt burned enough to leave the VTuber industry altogether. Upd8's Oda Nobuhime's later career has been known for a while, and at the time, it was also known that the original talents for Game-bu's Miria, Kaede, and Ryo had set up new characters that were briefly part of the same network before going independent (their current channels are linked in the sources comment of my original post). The one I couldn't track down at the time was Haruto, but that is no longer the case, as he's recently debuted with a major VTuber agency.

>!More specifically, he's now part of Holostars UPROAR!!, the fourth generation of Hololive's male sub-branch.!<

So if nothing else, it's good to see that the original Game-bu members have been able to keep going despite Unlimited throwing them under the bus.

I have a vague recollection that it had already sort of started with Kizuna AI, or at least that it had been teased but then retracted. In any case, Unlimited/Brave's reputation has been so shaky that ironically I wonder if this decision drives other agencies *away* from NFTs purely because Brave is doing it.

----- __333.13__ -----2022-04-15 10:43:14+08:00:

Just to clear up some confusion, upd8 was the agency branch of Activ8, while Game-bu was one particular project under Unlimited Inc./Brave Group. These were not parts of the same company, they just happen to have had similar scandals around the same time.

----- __333.14__ -----2022-04-16 18:08:01+08:00:

For what it's worth, I've never approached VTubers and the community around them as toxic to a unique extent, just in unique ways. This very subreddit shows that people will get angry and do awful things over *anything* given the chance.
