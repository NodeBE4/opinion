### 299: [forget.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/tw02pz/forget/), submitted on 2022-04-04 19:49:24+08:00.

I feel like it's more likely it was the 'Calvin Morrison' stuff she did for April Fools that was shared than the old pre-Calli stuff that she's disavowed.

### 300: [Question about the Universal Music deal for Calli](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tw2v5n/question_about_the_universal_music_deal_for_calli/), submitted on 2022-04-04 22:06:24+08:00.

> Aaaand the third reason, INNK wasn't always fully owned by Cover. It was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8. But Upd8 dissolved after poor management practices were made public, so Cover came into full ownership of INNK.

This is something I've seen a lot, but I legitimately cannot find any firm evidence to support it, and in fact a lot against:

1. AZKi debuted under Cover a few weeks before also being affiliated with Upd8, and it would be several more weeks before officially starting with INNK.

2. Suisei was never affiliated with Upd8 during her time with INNK.

3. While Upd8 dissolved, its parent company, Activ8, still exists, and it wouldn't make sense for Upd8, the sub-company within Activ8, to have had a stake in INNK that wouldn't be transferred to Activ8 if it was wound up.

The trouble is that the sentence 'INNK was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8' gets repeated a lot, but I've never seen anything to confirm this is actually true and not just an assumption that was made. As far as I can tell, INNK was always under Cover, and AZKi as an individual talent was under Cover but also an Upd8 affiliate (in the vein of HoneyStrap and AniMare being part of 774 but represented by Upd8), but INNK as a whole was not, hence Suisei being Cover-only.

[Ayame's last birthday live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7OaRnM9-A) was mostly group performances; Nene, Towa, and Suisei did a [Christmas concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVQQcI6r3NU) as a trio; more recently both [Suisei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHf9Tmdvpk) and [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrcZEjdrkRg) have done 3D Lives featuring each other, and Calli also featured Rikka from Holostars.

### 302: [So yeah, I guess Funimation is just being fed alive to Crunchyroll](https://old.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/tx043d/so_yeah_i_guess_funimation_is_just_being_fed/), submitted on 2022-04-06 01:22:53+08:00.

----- __302.1__ -----2022-04-06 14:24:51+08:00:

Is the rice company one Mai Princess (which is actually a trio although one of them streams very rarely) or is there a *different* rice-themed VTuber? Although as for the weather forecasting one, that's been around for a *long* time, even before Kizuna AI, but was originally a pseudo-Vocaloid rather than a live performance.

----- __302.2__ -----2022-04-06 14:26:52+08:00:

Not really, to be honest. At Hololive the VTubers *are* the idols, but it's the only significant agency with a heavy idol aesthetic. The other two major agencies (Nijisanji and VShojo) don't do the idol thing at all, nor do the vast majority of relatively established mid-tier agencies like 774 or VSpo. There are some music-heavy VTubers but that's relatively normal given a lot of them have backgrounds as utaite.

----- __302.3__ -----2022-04-06 22:09:01+08:00:

If it's Mai Princess then I feel like they're the least effective company mascots ever, because I watch Milky Queen semi-frequently and still have no idea what company they're mascots for, if they even are.

### 303: [So....what's up with Omega?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tx7bym/sowhats_up_with_omega/), submitted on 2022-04-06 06:45:39+08:00.

----- __303.1__ -----2022-04-06 11:18:51+08:00:

Given that Omega didn't even promote 3rd Fes I feel like the whole thing is on somewhat of a backburner now. My largely speculative take is that Omega was supposed to ultimately serve as EN's A-Chan, serving as a visible producer/director, but I think it went wrong for a few reasons:

1. While Omega was introduced along with Council, that did leave their position as regards Myth a little weird and open. Whereas A-Chan was there basically from the start and organically part of Hololive, building up Omega as this big producer/director figure for the whole of EN was kind of retcon-y almost because no such figure seems to have ever existed for Myth.

2. The focus on design and lore seemed just a bit extra. As characters, A-Chan, and more recently Nodoka, are supposed to just be normal humans working at Hololive, while Omega's whole 'divine being' status and elaborate character design all seem almost a bit tacky. I suspect a related issue is that there ends up being somewhat of a lore-specific power dynamic, i.e. Omega as a godlike figure seems to be decidedly more 'powerful' lore-wise than EN's members, whereas A-Chan and Nodoka are on the same level as the JP Holomems image-wise.

3. I legitimately don't think people were wholly receptive to an overtly non-feminine presence in HoloEN. Omega being gender-neutral but also occasionally alluded to in masculine terms I think did actually put people off who had seen HoloEN as a primarily female group. Optimistically there might be an image element to it related to the above: it might come across as a *little* iffy for the talent section to be all women, and the only known producer/director figure to not be. But if you want to blame idol culture I don't think I could say it wasn't part of it.

4. The way HoloEN appears to work, Omega was kind of superfluous. HoloEN, not unreasonably, has somewhat of an image of being self-organising to a great extent among the talents. Myth, IRyS, Council, and ID Gen 2 all started mixing and doing their own thing pretty quickly. 'A-Chan wrangles everyone into the studio' makes sense in context, 'Omega wrangles EN into doing a collab' does not.

----- __303.2__ -----2022-04-06 13:22:15+08:00:

> (considering that a JP manager, Mane-chan, is watching over Bae)

You realise that 'Mane-chan' is simply an abbreviated form of 'Manager-chan', right?

----- __303.3__ -----2022-04-06 22:24:27+08:00:

It's worth noting that manager=/=producer/director. A-chan (and presumably Omega, if Omega is indeed just one individual) doesn't actually manage any specific talents, but instead has some kind of higher-level role in planning and organising content, as well as a public-facing role as the 'voice of Hololive' so to speak when it comes to things like news updates or main-channel collabs. She essentially 'speaks for Hololive' as basically a representative of the agency in the abstract. J-Chad, Enma and Jenma, as well as the anonymous Mane-chans for Council and IRyS, aren't public-facing the way A-chan is, because their role is simply managing the EN Holomems on a day-to-day basis. Behind the scenes, whoever Omega is probably has a similar kind of role to A-chan in terms of managing and organising branch-wide activities, and the Omega character would have been there for the purposes of adding in A-chan's other role as the 'face' of Hololive as an agency, just for HoloEN instead of HoloJP.

Which actually leads me to the thought that a fifth reason why Omega's been sidelined is that A-chan's written English is pretty good, even if it may be run past a copy editor before anything is posted, so in a sense, there's even less point in having a specifically EN producer Twitter account for interactions if A-chan is now capable of handling EN Twitter interactions.

----- __303.4__ -----2022-04-06 22:27:43+08:00:

To be fair, A-chan has had a 3d model since July 2018 and Live2D since February 2019; it's just she's appeared with them more frequently as of late.
