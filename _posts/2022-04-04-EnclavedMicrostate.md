### 299: [forget.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/tw02pz/forget/), submitted on 2022-04-04 19:49:24+08:00.

----- __299.1__ -----2022-04-04 22:12:35+08:00:

I feel like it's more likely it was the 'Calvin Morrison' stuff she did for April Fools that was shared than the old pre-Calli stuff that she's disavowed.

### 300: [Question about the Universal Music deal for Calli](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tw2v5n/question_about_the_universal_music_deal_for_calli/), submitted on 2022-04-04 22:06:24+08:00.

> Aaaand the third reason, INNK wasn't always fully owned by Cover. It was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8. But Upd8 dissolved after poor management practices were made public, so Cover came into full ownership of INNK.

This is something I've seen a lot, but I legitimately cannot find any firm evidence to support it, and in fact a lot against:

1. AZKi debuted under Cover a few weeks before also being affiliated with Upd8, and it would be several more weeks before officially starting with INNK.

2. Suisei was never affiliated with Upd8 during her time with INNK.

3. While Upd8 dissolved, its parent company, Activ8, still exists, and it wouldn't make sense for Upd8, the sub-company within Activ8, to have had a stake in INNK that wouldn't be transferred to Activ8 if it was wound up.

The trouble is that the sentence 'INNK was a joint venture between Cover and Upd8' gets repeated a lot, but I've never seen anything to confirm this is actually true and not just an assumption that was made. As far as I can tell, INNK was always under Cover, and AZKi as an individual talent was under Cover but also an Upd8 affiliate (in the vein of HoneyStrap and AniMare being part of 774 but represented by Upd8), but INNK as a whole was not, hence Suisei being Cover-only.

### 301: [Are there any sources on the contemporary opinions of the Chinese concerning the Taiping Rebellion? (Amidst its heyday and subsequent defeat) Were they sympathetic or unsympathetic?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tw3xlj/are_there_any_sources_on_the_contemporary/), submitted on 2022-04-04 22:52:04+08:00.

----- __301.1__ -----2022-04-09 01:56:37+08:00:

I have had this question on the backburner for a while and I do wish to come back to it and write a full answer when I can; that said a lot of the scholarship relevant to it I read literally years ago and cannot recall in substantial detail at present and would need to go back over from near- scratch. In *general*, civilian responses to and reflections on the Taiping War related to the general depredations of the conflict itself and less to the ideological dimensions of the Taiping cause, but Confucian elites did tend towards a stronger ideological critique at the same time. A past Tuesday Trivia post of mine focussing on the case of Zhang Guanglie, who was a child during the war and whose mother was killed during a siege, can be found [here](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/al16kd/tuesday_trivia_how_did_people_in_your_era_deal/efaqih2/?context=999) 

However, while you wait for me to get my act together, I do have a few reading suggestions:

* Tobie Meyer-Fong, *What Remains* – This is basically the book to read that answers your question most directly; it discusses civilian perspectives on the conflict from a variety of angles. Also see her review of the 2013 translation of Zhang Daye's *The World of a Tiny Insect*, another memoir of a civilian survivor of the war.

* Indeed, Zhang Daye's *The World of a Tiny Insect*, translated by Tian Xiaofei, would be a good read in itself, if contextualised alongside Meyer-Fong's book.

* Jin Huan's article 'Stitching Words to Suture Wounds' discusses the diary of Shen Zi during the Taiping War, albeit more as a literary work than as a source on broader civilian perspectives.

* Chuck Wooldridge's *City of Virtues* includes a chapter on the period of the occupation of Nanjing and elite responses thereof.

### 302: [Zero Zombie Zones - Weekly Discussion Thread, April 4th, 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/tw8djd/zero_zombie_zones_weekly_discussion_thread_april/), submitted on 2022-04-05 01:54:21+08:00.

----- __302.1__ -----2022-04-05 02:11:46+08:00:

[Ayame's last birthday live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7OaRnM9-A) was mostly group performances; Nene, Towa, and Suisei did a [Christmas concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVQQcI6r3NU) as a trio; more recently both [Suisei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHf9Tmdvpk) and [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrcZEjdrkRg) have done 3D Lives featuring each other, and Calli also featured Rikka from Holostars.

----- __302.2__ -----2022-04-06 14:14:27+08:00:

Interesting choice of Bae as a point of comparison...

----- __302.3__ -----2022-04-10 18:24:21+08:00:

I have very little stake in the HoloCN drama specifically, but I do feel like it's not *that* unreasonable that if you hire 5 or 6 young Chinese women (IIRC one was actually Taiwanese) then you'll have *at least* one vocal nationalist who might put national loyalty above basically anything else.

Accent, I believe.

Speaking for myself as a HK-native, from what clips I've heard she seems to have had a Guangzhou accent in Cantonese, though to be fair that's not necessarily a big indicator either way.

### 303: [So yeah, I guess Funimation is just being fed alive to Crunchyroll](https://old.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/tx043d/so_yeah_i_guess_funimation_is_just_being_fed/), submitted on 2022-04-06 01:22:53+08:00.

----- __303.1__ -----2022-04-06 14:24:51+08:00:

Is the rice company one Mai Princess (which is actually a trio although one of them streams very rarely) or is there a *different* rice-themed VTuber? Although as for the weather forecasting one, that's been around for a *long* time, even before Kizuna AI, but was originally a pseudo-Vocaloid rather than a live performance.

----- __303.2__ -----2022-04-06 14:26:52+08:00:

Not really, to be honest. At Hololive the VTubers *are* the idols, but it's the only significant agency with a heavy idol aesthetic. The other two major agencies (Nijisanji and VShojo) don't do the idol thing at all, nor do the vast majority of relatively established mid-tier agencies like 774 or VSpo. There are some music-heavy VTubers but that's relatively normal given a lot of them have backgrounds as utaite.

----- __303.3__ -----2022-04-06 22:09:01+08:00:

If it's Mai Princess then I feel like they're the least effective company mascots ever, because I watch Milky Queen semi-frequently and still have no idea what company they're mascots for, if they even are.

----- __303.4__ -----2022-04-08 04:54:33+08:00:

That's not quite correct. While technically, Nijisanji is a division of Anycolor Inc. and Hololive is a division of COVER Corporation, these were companies set up as VTuber companies in 2017/18 whose other subdivisions are essentially nominal.

### 304: [So....what's up with Omega?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tx7bym/sowhats_up_with_omega/), submitted on 2022-04-06 06:45:39+08:00.

----- __304.1__ -----2022-04-06 11:18:51+08:00:

Given that Omega didn't even promote 3rd Fes I feel like the whole thing is on somewhat of a backburner now. My largely speculative take is that Omega was supposed to ultimately serve as EN's A-Chan, serving as a visible producer/director, but I think it went wrong for a few reasons:

1. While Omega was introduced along with Council, that did leave their position as regards Myth a little weird and open. Whereas A-Chan was there basically from the start and organically part of Hololive, building up Omega as this big producer/director figure for the whole of EN was kind of retcon-y almost because no such figure seems to have ever existed for Myth.

2. The focus on design and lore seemed just a bit extra. As characters, A-Chan, and more recently Nodoka, are supposed to just be normal humans working at Hololive, while Omega's whole 'divine being' status and elaborate character design all seem almost a bit tacky. I suspect a related issue is that there ends up being somewhat of a lore-specific power dynamic, i.e. Omega as a godlike figure seems to be decidedly more 'powerful' lore-wise than EN's members, whereas A-Chan and Nodoka are on the same level as the JP Holomems image-wise.

3. I legitimately don't think people were wholly receptive to an overtly non-feminine presence in HoloEN. Omega being gender-neutral but also occasionally alluded to in masculine terms I think did actually put people off who had seen HoloEN as a primarily female group. Optimistically there might be an image element to it related to the above: it might come across as a *little* iffy for the talent section to be all women, and the only known producer/director figure to not be. But if you want to blame idol culture I don't think I could say it wasn't part of it.

4. The way HoloEN appears to work, Omega was kind of superfluous. HoloEN, not unreasonably, has somewhat of an image of being self-organising to a great extent among the talents. Myth, IRyS, Council, and ID Gen 2 all started mixing and doing their own thing pretty quickly. 'A-Chan wrangles everyone into the studio' makes sense in context, 'Omega wrangles EN into doing a collab' does not.

----- __304.2__ -----2022-04-06 13:22:15+08:00:

> (considering that a JP manager, Mane-chan, is watching over Bae)

You realise that 'Mane-chan' is simply an abbreviated form of 'Manager-chan', right?

----- __304.3__ -----2022-04-06 22:24:27+08:00:

It's worth noting that manager=/=producer/director. A-chan (and presumably Omega, if Omega is indeed just one individual) doesn't actually manage any specific talents, but instead has some kind of higher-level role in planning and organising content, as well as a public-facing role as the 'voice of Hololive' so to speak when it comes to things like news updates or main-channel collabs. She essentially 'speaks for Hololive' as basically a representative of the agency in the abstract. J-Chad, Enma and Jenma, as well as the anonymous Mane-chans for Council and IRyS, aren't public-facing the way A-chan is, because their role is simply managing the EN Holomems on a day-to-day basis. Behind the scenes, whoever Omega is probably has a similar kind of role to A-chan in terms of managing and organising branch-wide activities, and the Omega character would have been there for the purposes of adding in A-chan's other role as the 'face' of Hololive as an agency, just for HoloEN instead of HoloJP.

Which actually leads me to the thought that a fifth reason why Omega's been sidelined is that A-chan's written English is pretty good, even if it may be run past a copy editor before anything is posted, so in a sense, there's even less point in having a specifically EN producer Twitter account for interactions if A-chan is now capable of handling EN Twitter interactions.

----- __304.4__ -----2022-04-06 22:27:43+08:00:

To be fair, A-chan has had a 3d model since July 2018 and Live2D since February 2019; it's just she's appeared with them more frequently as of late.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

It is, to be fair, quite an old one that I may update at some point, but it is about the best summary I can provide. While there were definitely refugees from the kingdom, including Hong Xiuquan's nephew Hong Quanfu, the core infrastructure of its religion was so comprehensively crushed that its wider survival was nigh-impossible.

While true of sedentary societies, pastoral nomads have historically been far easier to mobilise – Nikolai Kradin estimates around 75% of the adult male population in a pastoral society could be put under arms without compromising food production. If one quarter of the population was male adults, 75% of that would be just under 19%, so close enough. Of course, do have to assume for that a) that the adult male population was indeed around 25%, and b) that the Khwarezmian population was overwhelmingly pastoral nomadic; on the latter count I don't personally know what the demographic division between sedentary and pastoral populations may have been.

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?"

Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself. 

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp. 

Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.

We ought not to act as though Hong Kong's local authorities are incapable of making bad decisions. To be quite honest, a lot of the extremes of COVID policy in China, both in Hong Kong and on the mainland, have been the result of the *lack* of a coherent central strategy. Local authorities at various levels have been more or less winging it, in part because COVID cases have, until recently, been so low that there have been more resources built up, that have in turn been spent on much more severe interventions. The hamster cull wasn't a case of 'Beijing came for your pets', it was a case of 'HK local authorities, with a lot of resources but still very low case numbers to have to deal with, trying to look like they're doing something really important.'

### 329: [Looking for places to read what’s been translated of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom/God Worshipping Society scriptures, as well as books more generally on their theology](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChineseHistory/comments/u0c3qm/looking_for_places_to_read_whats_been_translated/), submitted on 2022-04-10 14:51:38+08:00.

----- __329.1__ -----2022-04-10 17:52:33+08:00:

Taiping theology is a pretty well-studied topic, though the older of a work you look at, generally the less good it is. The things to read, in descending order, would be:

* Carl Kilcourse, *Taiping Theology* (2017)

* Thomas Reilly, *The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Religion and the Blasphemy of Empire* (2004)

* Rudolf Wagner, *Re-enacting the Heavenly Vision* (1984)

* Vincent Shih, *The Taiping Ideology* (1967)

* Eugene Boardman, *Christian Influence Upon the Ideology of the Taiping Rebellion* (1971)

As for translated works, nearly the entire corpus of then-extant Taiping documents was translated by a team from the University of California back in the late 1960s, and published in 1971 as the second and third volumes of *The Taiping Rebellion: Documents and Comments*.

----- __329.2__ -----2022-04-10 18:17:09+08:00:

No problem! I would stress that the last two books on there need to be read with a grain of salt, as both are attempts – for differing reasons – to dispel the notion of the Taiping as 'real' Christians. Shih's main focus is locating Confucian influences in Taiping policies and manifestoes, while Boardman, a practicing Quaker, saw the Taiping's ostensible Old Testament focus and general violence as disqualifying them from his personal, denominationally-influenced definition of Christianity. Kilcourse, Reilly, and Wagner offer more rounded views.

> Hong Kong is overrun

I'd amend that to 'has been overrun'; cases peaked at the beginning of March but tailed off relatively quickly and we're back at 4-digit daily case numbers and falling (plus there's just been a 3-day citywide mass test which actually hasn't turned up *that* many more cases than were being reported already). That said, basically one in every seven people caught Omicron, and we've had nearly 9000 deaths which, while not a lot compared to some places, is still 9000 too many in one way or another.

It's also worth adding that 'zero covid policy' can manifest very differently in different places. For instance, HK never went under any form of strict lockdown, even during this Omicron wave. Zero-covid has been less the name of a singular strategy and more of a target, one reached mainly through *comparatively* limited distancing measures (escalated as necessary) and contact tracing.

While a common statement, I've never seen firm evidence that it was an NDA that was broken, or more specifically, that it was the disclosure aspect of the contract. As it stands, Cover has not and likely will not ever disclose the nature of the contract breaches.
