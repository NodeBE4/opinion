### 370: [The U.S. Doesn’t Need Another Democracy Summit: It Needs a Plan to Confront Authoritarianism](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12458zk/the_us_doesnt_need_another_democracy_summit_it/), submitted on 2023-03-28 07:40:20+08:00.

\[SS from the essay by Jon Temin, Vice President of Policy and Programs at the Truman Center for National Policy. From 2014 to 2017, he served on the U.S. Department of State’s Policy Planning Staff.\]

Biden’s first Summit for Democracy, held virtually in December 2021, sought to galvanize democratic countries to work toward advancing democracy within their own borders. But the United States didn’t build an accompanying monitoring mechanism, making it difficult to track countries’ progress on the commitments they made. Nor has the United States made defending democracy abroad a major foreign policy priority, a puzzling decision given that Biden has described the struggle between democracy and autocracy as “the defining challenge of our time.”  
As a candidate for president, Biden campaigned on the need to preserve democracy at home and abroad. Since taking office, he has championed voting rights and worked to strengthen democratic institutions within the United States. But his administration’s approach to defending democracy beyond U.S. borders has been much less vigorous. It has centered around organizing summits that bring together countries that are already largely committed to democracy, bolstering democratic reformers, and responding to broad, thematic challenges to democracy, such as the use of technology to limit individual freedoms. None of this requires making hard choices between values and interests when dealing with autocracies or backsliding democracies or confronting individual autocratic leaders.
