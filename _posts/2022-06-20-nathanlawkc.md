Thank you so much @nathalieguibert @lemondefr for this wonderful profile explaining my political activism and the importance of fighting against dictators, protecting democracy TOGETHER.<br>Europe needs more voice countering the totalitarianism of CCP. <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/06/22/des-responsables-francais-en-retrait-face-au-dissident-hongkongais-nathan-law_6131513_3210.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/06/22/des-responsables-francais-en-retrait-face-au-dissident-hongkongais-nathan-law_6131513_3210.html</a>

Honored to meet with the former French President François Hollande @fhollande. We talked about the political crackdowns in Hong Kong and human rights abuses in China.<br>I will continue to dialogue with leaders and discuss how we can defend democracy together. It's our mission.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FV7j5iGWYAMPb1k?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

It's my honor to be officially received at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My deepest gratitude to the ambassador of human rights @delphborione's effort to safeguard universal values. I hope the dialogue can continue and explore means to protect global human rights.
