Thank you so much @nathalieguibert @lemondefr for this wonderful profile explaining my political activism and the importance of fighting against dictators, protecting democracy TOGETHER.<br>Europe needs more voice countering the totalitarianism of CCP. <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/06/22/des-responsables-francais-en-retrait-face-au-dissident-hongkongais-nathan-law_6131513_3210.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/06/22/des-responsables-francais-en-retrait-face-au-dissident-hongkongais-nathan-law_6131513_3210.html</a>

Honored to meet with the former French President François Hollande @fhollande. We talked about the political crackdowns in Hong Kong and human rights abuses in China.<br>I will continue to dialogue with leaders and discuss how we can defend democracy together. It's our mission.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FV7j5iGWYAMPb1k?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

It's my honor to be officially received at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My deepest gratitude to the ambassador of human rights @delphborione's effort to safeguard universal values. I hope the dialogue can continue and explore means to protect global human rights.

//The book is at its best when dealing with specifics .... Law argues that those signs exist around the world, and therefore freedom shouldn’t be taken for granted in any country.... Law offers a warning and a wake-up call.// <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2022/01/reviewed-in-short-new-titles-from-nathan-law-johann-hari-bart-van-loo-and-sasa-stanisic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2022/01/reviewed-in-short-new-titles-from-nathan-law-johann-hari-bart-van-loo-and-sasa-stanisic</a>
