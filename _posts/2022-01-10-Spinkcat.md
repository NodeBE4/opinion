### 1493: [What do you think the Steam Deck will mean for Linux Gaming in the long term?](https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/s07h3k/what_do_you_think_the_steam_deck_will_mean_for/), submitted on 2022-01-10 09:33:42+08:00.

Dedicated gaming  system in all X86 hardware，Windows 11 is a disaster .Microsoft can't balance games and all platforms,we need a universal open source system,so we should think about SteamDeck will mean for SteamOS,and What SteamOS means to all gamers.

Custom dedicated gaming system  performance of running games is better, without the bloat of win，right now Proton performance gap is 15-25%,some games only 2-5%,if Valve keep continues to invest  Linux and SteamOS, one day the performance will surpass Windows，smaller size, better power consumption, better performance mining.

### 1494: [Why it makes sense Valve uses Linux](https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/s1nmzd/why_it_makes_sense_valve_uses_linux/), submitted on 2022-01-12 05:08:03+08:00.

----- __1494.1__ -----2022-01-12 07:52:52+08:00:

I think Valve want make a dedicated gaming system in all X86 hardware,Microsoft won't develop dedicated windows for games,they want PC ,they want android and mobile,its why Windows 11 is a disaster.

The steam deck is not the point, the point is SteamOS and its future，maybe Microsoft has an agreement with Valve, and Valve helps Microsoft take on a dedicated gaming system that it doesn't have the energy to take charge of, forming a tech alliance.

I'm not a developer, but from what I understand, LINUX seems to have a lot of performance potential on custom systems, it's just that it's been lacking a lot of investment from larger companies because it's not profitable to do that.

If the game performance of LIUNX exceeds the window one day, not only 5-10%, but 20-30%, maybe more, you don't need to do extra things to get the best performance. 

Both players and developers will receive passive optimizations, and even Valve will provide a developer-specific operating environment like Steamworks. 

Allowing for cross-platform use, such as VR, handheld and PC, and I think consoles as well, multiple evidence that they are also developing consoles that are truly their own.

Based on the openness of the valve, when you provide excellent service and openness at the same time, it will automatically be compatible with most players, instead of shutting people out because of exclusive and closed ecology.

This value is reflected in their hardware and software products, which have been prominent in the recent steam deck.

Although both SteamOS and Steam themselves are threatening Microsoft and the gaming department, it is definitely not accidental that Microsoft and Phil Spencer still maintain a friendly relationship with Valve. Phil Spencer also advocates an open policy, which coincides with Valve's values.

I'm not a developer, but from what I understand, Linux seems to have a lot of performance potential on custom systems, it's just that it's been lacking a lot of investment from larger companies because it's not profitable to do that.

I suspect  Proton is a transitional project, a temporary solution until a mature solution is found to fully develop Linux games, because most players will not take the initiative to use Linux, and there is still a 15-25% loss in performance, so the valve passes Launch hardware with market demand to promote the share of Linux. When people are used to SteamOS, they will have user stickiness to the hardware and software, and will gradually allow users' usage habits to migrate from Windows to Linux.

In the end, Valve will gain an unshakable market niche, which will be compatible with the needs of most people due to its openness and cross-platform ease of use, and provide better services from the source, not just functions in the store To attract players to avoid being robbed of users by EPIC's exclusivity policy, which is why they are not interested in competing with EPIC, because it is a very old saturated market, and Valve is trying to open up a whole new field.

Most of the hardware is a channel to attract players to Linux at the beginning. Players use Linux because the hardware has advantages that are hard to refuse, but slowly they also find the characteristics of Linux (and its shortcomings), when SteamOS can get through more In the field of Valve hardware, players will realize that a stable and efficient SteamOS is far better than an unstable operating environment, because professional systems across hardware platforms are very important.

Then SteamOS feeds back the hardware market, making players realize the efficiency and convenience of the combination of the two. I remember Valve once said that VR has a very good performance on Linux, so if they persist and succeed, Linux will open up multiple The hardware market runs through several Valve hardware products. In addition to handhelds, there are also next-generation VR, the rumored Valve console, and the BCI hardware that Valve will launch sooner or later.

If you want to convince players to use Linux, you must prove to the players that Linux is good, not just good for Valve. Gabe doesn't care if the quarterly financial report is slightly better. He needs convincing evidence to attract players to the Linux market. Hardware is the best choice.

You're going to buy a steam deck because of the demand for handhelds, you're going to buy Deckard because of the demand for next-gen VR, and I don't know if their console will be released, but if Valve launches a console, there will be Decisive difference, to prove you're not buying another Steambox or a PS5, I mean there must be something in it that appeals to you, as BCI hardware appeals to me, although Valve hasn't had any word on that at all, but if it launches I would buy one right away without a second thought.

### 1496: [紫阳这段话你认同吗](https://old.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/s3r0h6/紫阳这段话你认同吗/), submitted on 2022-01-14 20:16:28+08:00.

----- __1496.1__ -----2022-01-15 00:00:02+08:00:

结论与事实不符，倒邓是赵离开国内后就发生了的事，赵与邓分歧也不是因为戈尔巴乔夫谈话。

----- __1496.2__ -----2022-01-15 00:16:12+08:00:

这件事不是赵邓矛盾的原因，双方矛盾是因为之后五月会议上赵坚持不同意邓的方案。

邓生气是有两个原因和说法。

第一是邓已经准备好镇压，但没告诉过赵，怕赵不同意，装没事答应赵温和处理，然后立刻出四二六社论，以此生米煮成熟饭。

第二是说李鹏等人趁赵出国访问，接管直接对学运的工作，祸水东引给邓小平吹风，试图拉邓小平下水，激化学运与邓之间的矛盾对立。

实际情况更可能是两种情况混合，邓已做好镇压准备，李鹏有煽风点火，但主要是邓自己主导，赵对戈尔巴乔夫的谈话引起邓的不满，就是因为把矛盾转移到邓身上，而邓原本是希望赵和李鹏背锅。

李鹏在日记里也给自己有一定辩护，但没敢直接说明到底谁拍板镇压甩锅。

赵个人则认为，可能是有人煽风点火，但邓也没傻到偏听偏信，已经暗示邓有意主导他拍板镇压，让赵紫阳与李鹏替他挡刀的计划，所以赵紫阳才旁敲侧击说六四是政变。

戈尔巴乔夫谈话前，胡赵派系已经尽可能通过各种中间人或直接渠道，呼吁学运尽快结束和平解决，我觉得可以肯定他们至少在4月26日以后，内部消息已经能知道或感觉到邓小平要靠武力镇压解决问题。

学运没解决的主要问题，就是四二六社论定性，会进行事后追责，引起学运参与者的恐慌，胡赵派系意识到邓要出手，会逼迫胡赵派系站队表明立场，然后进行清洗。

邓对赵与戈尔巴乔夫的谈话只是不满，真正彻底放弃赵紫阳是517会议，该会议里给赵紫阳最后一次表态机会，赵紫阳跟胡启立坚决反对，5月19赵彻底失势，提前到了广场做最后的警告，但没有把话说明白军队要杀人，给邓这个老首长最后的体面，改革历程里也是这样。

----- __1496.3__ -----2022-01-15 00:25:58+08:00:

不是贴金，赵紫阳在四川主政时，与早年极左的路线完全不同，他自我反思意识到早年的错误并且公开承认，在极权社会里自我否定与反省是极为罕见的。

所以基于这种痛定思痛的路线，赵在人生的后半生才算真正活明白，也认为自己打开了思路与视野，我们可以看到他的政策与思路成长曲线。

用早年基于极左倾向办事的错误结果与行为，去攻击一个人前后逆转的一生，本身就是希望借着这个话题去否定整个改开合理性的基础，有一些观点已经构架出赵紫阳等是大饥荒的罪魁祸首，毛只是被误导的说法。

----- __1496.4__ -----2022-01-15 00:48:56+08:00:

赵紫阳这个人是什么样的人，其实我也科普很多次了，感觉每次有新话题都好像很多人没接触过这方面的内容，大体来说他是经济和政治上都很有远见的领导者，而且工作能力强，学习速度快。

看他各方面政策改革就可以了解到这个人的水平到底怎么，几乎一手设计和定制了现代中国的经济、社会与政治基础框架，包括后续的人才团队的诞生与官僚预备役，要么来自胡耀邦，要么来自赵紫阳。

胡耀邦建立了现代中国政府，储备了大量的预备役人才，赵紫阳一开始是辅助胡耀邦的角色，主导行政工作不管路线，所以在人事斗争上，赵紫阳是尽可能避开派系问题，这也导致赵紫阳的政治面貌当年不清晰，六四时也有人把李鹏赵紫阳放一起骂。

不过后来胡耀邦被政变逼宫下台，赵紫阳被强制性推上第一领袖的位置，很快就开始转型扩大对胡耀邦改革派的庇护，如果说赵本身在晚年是开明的，那胡耀邦整体上更有人文主义的执政精神，对给赵紫阳的遗产就是一整个改革派的预备役梯队。

而赵紫阳就是围绕这些人的交流，拓展思维的边界，慢慢建立起现代中国发展的轨迹。

他对整个中国的影响，不止是六四反对镇压这点事，实际上六四里他的表态只是一个很微不足道的小事。

真正的长期影响，是经济、政治改革层面，不但构思了，还做到了，并且预判了未来几十年中国的改革路线与需求，提出了和平解决问题的过渡机制。

所以赵紫阳不止是个晚年开明的领袖这么简单，他是对现代中国有革命性影响的一个政治人物，远远大于邓小平，他的言论与观点，你几十年前看有用，现在看也有用，几十年后看还有用。

胡耀邦如果按历史排序其实会次于赵紫阳，一个是死的比较早，另一个是不主导行政与执行工作，但胡耀邦提供了价值观路线，虽然被废除了，但这种价值观集成了下来，成为了中国现代自由主义或开放化的一个源头，再有就是万里了，不过这里不赘述。

后人修共和国现代史，如果不受政治因素影响，胡赵万作为改开三杰，会占据相当大的篇幅，都是有单独立传资格的人。很多人都缺乏对胡赵的准确认知，因为信息污染实在太严重了。

虽然经济与工业发展是社会稳定科技进步后的必然结果，但如果能代入当时氛围就能明白做正确的事，走客观规律也是个极其困难的道路。

当时在中国，不走客观规律，就是中国的客观规律。邓在这点上支持胡赵万，但整体上还有相当多数的人根本不希望中国走向真正意义的现代化市场经济路线。

怎么在完全未知，没有参考经验，一身债的情况下，把中国盘活了让经济准确的进入起飞轨道，还要顶着保守派全面反扑的斗争，能成就现代中国许多人以外的经济奇迹，本身就是一种“奇迹”。

只是现在被欺世盗名之徒拿来将功绩扣在自己头上，坐享其成不止，还要污蔑前人，剥削后人，一副我死后哪管洪水滔天，完全不把自己当作中国人，自视为中国人的头号大敌，这样的人就算立传，最好的结果也是毁誉参半，更何况遗臭万年。

----- __1496.5__ -----2022-01-15 00:52:00+08:00:

这其实是个常见的错误说法，赵紫阳在此事前已经没法经常见到邓了，邓也拒绝跟他沟通，戈尔巴乔夫谈话主要是让邓更加不满，但并不是分歧的来源。

邓放弃和不满赵，是因为赵坚持不拥护邓的路线，嫡系不支持自己，而邓决定镇压要在党内承受很大政治风险。
