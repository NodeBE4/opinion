Dedicated gaming  system in all X86 hardware，Windows 11 is a disaster .Microsoft can't balance games and all platforms,we need a universal open source system,so we should think about SteamDeck will mean for SteamOS,and What SteamOS means to all gamers.

Custom dedicated gaming system  performance of running games is better, without the bloat of win，right now Proton performance gap is 15-25%,some games only 2-5%,if Valve keep continues to invest  Linux and SteamOS, one day the performance will surpass Windows，smaller size, better power consumption, better performance mining.
