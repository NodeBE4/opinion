Our support for Taiwan should be firm and strong. Leaders from democratic countries should not be deterred from visiting Taiwan and sharing experiences with the government.<br>Backing down to the Chinese regime will only encourage them to bully more.

Many don't understand the Chinese authority's mentality. Complying with them makes them think that you are weak -- only deterrence can stop CCP's threats.<br><br>For them, every policy is for domestic consumption. Don't act in a way CCP can claim a clear victory.
