Our support for Taiwan should be firm and strong. Leaders from democratic countries should not be deterred from visiting Taiwan and sharing experiences with the government.<br>Backing down to the Chinese regime will only encourage them to bully more.

Many don't understand the Chinese authority's mentality. Complying with them makes them think that you are weak -- only deterrence can stop CCP's threats.<br><br>For them, every policy is for domestic consumption. Don't act in a way CCP can claim a clear victory.

Any military actions from CCP to Speaker Pelosi's visit are unprovoked and unjustified. <br>China wants to cut Taiwan off from global affairs, which this idea shouldn't have existed in the first place. The visit doesn't break the status quo over sovereignty dispute; only war does.

Taiwan has every right to host Speaker Pelosi. This is not a provocation - it's just a govt doing what govt does. Allies now must state clearly that any military threats from China are intolerable. We must step up and deter Chinese dictators from launching another unprovoked war.

Thank you @SpeakerPelosi for your continuous support to the democratic struggles in Hong Kong and China. You are welcomed in Taiwan, as well as in all places where democracy is in place. <br>Hope you have a fruitful journey.<br>(Photo taken in London.

Re ‚Äú‚ÄòFreedom‚Äô is an essential and timely read, warning policymakers, advocates and all people of the erosion to freedom happening before our eyes and equipping us to combat this challenge.‚Äù<br><br>- Speaker Nancy Pelosi

The Chinese regime has been blackmailing other countries by ceasing collaborations on crucial issues to the whole world. <br>They advance their self-interest by holding the world hostage.<br><br>Stuart Lau:‚ÄÇChina‚Äôs new 8 measures against US:<br><br>1 No more communication btwn military theatre leaders<br>2 No more Ministries of Defence working meetings<br>3 No more maritime security dialogues<br>4 No more illegal migrant repatriation<br>5 No more criminal justice assistance<br>6 No more climate talks<br><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZY6E3yWQAYF2_m?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
