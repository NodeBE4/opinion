Re Then we often have, added to this, the featuring of Xi speeches in Qiushi journal, leading editions. This is something we explored recently in "Xi Jinping, Headline Columnist." <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/01/20/xi-jinping-headline-columnist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/01/20/xi-jinping-headline-columnist/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Etsz0BHUUAAna8B?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
