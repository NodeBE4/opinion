Re This one, in the upper left on the image above, is about "the system of rule of law with Chinese characteristics" (中国特色社会主义法治体系). Xi says the CCP must "rule of law methods to carry out international struggle" (要运用法治手段开展国际斗争).

Re This means, according to the article, strengthening PRC legislation in foreign-related areas, and further improving laws and regs against sanctions, interference and "long-arm jurisdiction" (长臂管辖) -- promoting a system of Chinese laws applicable outside China.

A high-level directive issued by Xi Jinping on the outbreak in Hong Kong has been headline news inside the SAR. But the odd question about these “important instructions”: Why have they not appeared at all in the mainland Chinese media? <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/02/17/for-hong-kong-important-instructions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/02/17/for-hong-kong-important-instructions/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLyGac9aMAACF6w?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re As we explain in our CMP Dictionary, “important instructions” denotes a specific decision-making act at the highest levels of the Chinese Communist Party. In the Xi Jinping era, the phrase is now exclusive to Xi -- and generally big news. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/important-instructions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/important-instructions/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLyIWhxaAAA3kDP?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Our latest in the CMP Dictionary: "main melody" (主旋律), a term describing activity in the cultural sphere, that sticks to the main political line of the CCP, ensuring the Party’s voice is dominant and leads the chorus. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/main-melody/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/the_ccp_dictionary/main-melody/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FL1v6gPaUAANbAR?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
