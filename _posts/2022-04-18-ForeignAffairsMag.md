### 216: [How Autocrats Endure: Viktor Orban and the Myth of the Self-Destructing Strongman](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/u75z6b/how_autocrats_endure_viktor_orban_and_the_myth_of/), submitted on 2022-04-19 22:05:56+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Jan-Werner Mueller\]

"The Hungarian election—the first major vote in Europe since the war in Ukraine began—calls into question any facile assumptions about the limits of autocracy, even within the EU itself. Instead of weakening over time, Orban has carefully crafted a system that is apparently inoculated against democracy and smart enough to survive even in the face of policy blunders. International observers have focused on his government’s successive campaigns against refugees, George Soros, the European Union, and, as of late, the LGBTQ community. (After all, each time Orban faces election he has needed to conjure up a new existential threat to the nation.) But beyond these strategies, which are easy enough for other aspiring autocrats to copy, there is the more complex picture of how Orban, a trained lawyer who surrounds himself with other savvy jurists, has for so long kept up a façade of perfect legality—and even legitimacy—for his rule."

### 217: [The New Nuclear Age: How China’s Growing Nuclear Arsenal Threatens Deterrence](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/u761v1/the_new_nuclear_age_how_chinas_growing_nuclear/), submitted on 2022-04-19 22:09:24+08:00.

\[SS from the article by Andrew F. Krepinevich, Jr., Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute and an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\]

"There is nothing the United States can do to prevent China from joining it and Russia as the world’s top nuclear powers, but there are things that U.S. strategists and defense planners can do to mitigate the consequences. For starters, Washington will need to modernize its nuclear deterrent. But it will also need to engage in new ways of thinking about the nuclear balance of power and how, in a far more complex strategic environment, it can maintain deterrence and keep the nuclear peace."
