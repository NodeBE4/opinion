### 362: [Azerbaijanis executing Armenian POWs. NSFL üîû](https://old.reddit.com/r/N_N_N/comments/xu2ao0/azerbaijanis_executing_armenian_pows_nsfl/), submitted on 2022-10-03 06:48:40+08:00.

No. Azerbaijanis act like Chechen terrorists.

----- __362.2__ -----2022-10-06 02:35:05+08:00:

Would be even better if Armenians were in a position to defend themselves from Azerbaijani war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression in general.

----- __362.3__ -----2022-10-06 08:47:57+08:00:

This is all a tragedy and it is unconscionable.   Russia is in a very difficult situation with Armenia because if they start pouring munitions into that country, the United States State Department will do the same with Azerbaijan.  For this reason, Moscow correctly understands that they would only be pouring gas on the fire.

The only way this stops is when Azerbaijan and Turkey pay an unacceptably high price for their past war crimes and crimes against humanity.  I am out of step with the State Department on this and I have no reservations whatsoever about saying it. 

What Azerbaijan and Turkey are doing is egregious.  It is intolerable in any civilized world.  And it must be stopped.

----- __363.1__ -----2022-10-06 02:13:49+08:00:

I think I posted about this in r/crime a while back.  The DOJ was all over this under the prior administration.

----- __363.2__ -----2022-10-06 02:19:57+08:00:

The current administration appears to have pivoted resources away from things like counterintelligence and eliminating illegal Chinese ops on American (as well as Canadian) soil to other "priorities."  

Lamentable.

### 364: [David Hogg: We must make an example out of Putin in Ukraine to stop him from rebuilding the USSR](https://old.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/xwjmi1/david_hogg_we_must_make_an_example_out_of_putin/), submitted on 2022-10-06 03:19:31+08:00.

----- __364.1__ -----2022-10-06 09:36:59+08:00:

Let's draft David Hogg to go fight the war he clearly wants. 

I do not understand the American fascination with stupid kids, such as Hogg, who say stupid things, such as [this](https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/1577628899785117696?s=19).

----- __365.1__ -----2022-10-07 07:54:28+08:00:

Kadyrov is to Russia what Uday Saddam Hussein was to Iraq.

### 367: [The CIA Thought Putin Would Quickly Conquer Ukraine. Why Did They Get It So Wrong?](https://old.reddit.com/r/politicalwarfare/comments/xxnlia/the_cia_thought_putin_would_quickly_conquer/), submitted on 2022-10-07 10:45:40+08:00.

----- __367.1__ -----2022-10-07 10:49:13+08:00:

> ‚ÄúThere was no reporting on the corruption in the Russian system,‚Äù said the former senior intelligence official. ‚ÄúThey missed it, and ignored any evidence of it.‚Äù

You miss 100% of what you can't see.  And the United States couldn't see much of anything, because on an overreliance on sigint at the expense of actual targeting by actual operatives in denied areas.

----- __367.2__ -----2022-10-09 23:44:08+08:00:

The basic premise of the article is that the CIA's analysis of Putin's odds of success were wildly off, which amounts to an inexplicable intelligence failure. 

The problem is that this article is evaluating an assessment of what would have happened in Ukraine upon Putin's invasion, without American and other external intervention in Ukraine itself.  It turns out that Putin would have conquered Ukraine very quickly, had the United States not provided the material, tactical and intelligence support it has. Here's a quick example/explanation:  

* The Russian army's points of greatest vulnerability are in the logistics of its operations.  Fuel trucks are one case of that particular category of vulnerabilities.   

* Targeting fuel trucks was a force magnifier, which allowed Ukraine's "army" to punch well above its weight.  If you stop fuel trucks, then you stop tanks.  

* Russian tanks have about a 45-65 km range, and if they can't be refueled they are functionally useless, as the images of abandoned, destroyed and empty tanks littered throughout Ukraine readily demonstrate. 

* The idea to target fuel trucks was not Ukraine's.  They were provided with both the strategy (to target fuel trucks) and the actual targets (the actual inbound fuel trucks) in real time.  

* Had Ukraine not been provided with both the strategy and real time targets, those fuel trucks would have resupplied Russian tanks and they would have kept advancing in and throughout Ukraine.  

The analysis the Intercept is referring to, and criticizing, was a scenario in which Ukraine lacked any such support. 

But I'd also note that the quality of assessments is not exactly what it could be.  Starting in the 1990s and continuing through the present, the United States' ground capabilities in denied areas, or formerly denied areas (such as the territory that is now the Russian Federation) is acutely limited.  

This is as a result of many decisions to rely on information sources that are not humint to an unreasonably significant degree.  So, instead of having people inside and in proximity to the Kremlin, the United States largely relies on other information sources (e.g., sigint).  This is why the United States struggles to understand what is going on inside Russia and at the highest levels of Russia's political leadership.

### 368: [r/worldnews removing all posts about an ex-cop who murdered 24 children at a preschool in Thailand](https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditCensorship/comments/xxqhe5/rworldnews_removing_all_posts_about_an_excop_who/), submitted on 2022-10-07 13:18:17+08:00.

----- __368.1__ -----2022-10-08 00:27:52+08:00:

/r/worldnews is moderated by a group who consistently use their position to push their own agenda or the narratives that Reddit desires to promulgate.  That a person has shown a passt propensity to do so is often the deciding factor in whether they are even invited to moderate.  

Many of the moderators on /r/worldnews and other such subs also moderate other subs as well, where they do the same thing. In this way, Reddit functions in much the same way as Twitter to create an illusory "consensus reality," enforced by banning or removing any and all who state anything else. 

It's not so much a "hive mind" as a cultivated information ecosystem.

----- __368.2__ -----2022-10-08 14:07:47+08:00:

Thai tourist industry, for example.  I'm not inclined to speculate, though.
