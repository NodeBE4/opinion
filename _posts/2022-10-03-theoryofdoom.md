### 361: [Azerbaijanis executing Armenian POWs. NSFL ðŸ”ž](https://old.reddit.com/r/N_N_N/comments/xu2ao0/azerbaijanis_executing_armenian_pows_nsfl/), submitted on 2022-10-03 06:48:40+08:00.

No. Azerbaijanis act like Chechen terrorists.

----- __361.2__ -----2022-10-06 02:35:05+08:00:

Would be even better if Armenians were in a position to defend themselves from Azerbaijani war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression in general.

----- __361.3__ -----2022-10-06 08:47:57+08:00:

This is all a tragedy and it is unconscionable.   Russia is in a very difficult situation with Armenia because if they start pouring munitions into that country, the United States State Department will do the same with Azerbaijan.  For this reason, Moscow correctly understands that they would only be pouring gas on the fire.

The only way this stops is when Azerbaijan and Turkey pay an unacceptably high price for their past war crimes and crimes against humanity.  I am out of step with the State Department on this and I have no reservations whatsoever about saying it. 

What Azerbaijan and Turkey are doing is egregious.  It is intolerable in any civilized world.  And it must be stopped.

### 362: [How China and its allies pool resources to target overseas dissidents: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and Interpol are commonly used to pursue political opponents overseas.](https://old.reddit.com/r/politicalwarfare/comments/xvzoqz/how_china_and_its_allies_pool_resources_to_target/), submitted on 2022-10-05 11:43:54+08:00.

----- __362.1__ -----2022-10-06 02:13:49+08:00:

I think I posted about this in r/crime a while back.  The DOJ was all over this under the prior administration.

----- __362.2__ -----2022-10-06 02:19:57+08:00:

The current administration appears to have pivoted resources away from things like counterintelligence and eliminating illegal Chinese ops on American (as well as Canadian) soil to other "priorities."  

Lamentable.

### 363: [David Hogg: We must make an example out of Putin in Ukraine to stop him from rebuilding the USSR](https://old.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/xwjmi1/david_hogg_we_must_make_an_example_out_of_putin/), submitted on 2022-10-06 03:19:31+08:00.

----- __363.1__ -----2022-10-06 09:36:59+08:00:

Let's draft David Hogg to go fight the war he clearly wants. 

I do not understand the American fascination with stupid kids, such as Hogg, who say stupid things, such as [this](https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/1577628899785117696?s=19).
