### 361: [Azerbaijanis executing Armenian POWs. NSFL ðŸ”ž](https://old.reddit.com/r/N_N_N/comments/xu2ao0/azerbaijanis_executing_armenian_pows_nsfl/), submitted on 2022-10-03 06:48:40+08:00.

No. Azerbaijanis act like Chechen terrorists.

Would be even better if Armenians were in a position to defend themselves from Azerbaijani war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression in general.

### 362: [How China and its allies pool resources to target overseas dissidents: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and Interpol are commonly used to pursue political opponents overseas.](https://old.reddit.com/r/politicalwarfare/comments/xvzoqz/how_china_and_its_allies_pool_resources_to_target/), submitted on 2022-10-05 11:43:54+08:00.

I think I posted about this in r/crime a while back.  The DOJ was all over this under the prior administration.

----- __362.2__ -----2022-10-06 02:19:57+08:00:

The current administration appears to have pivoted resources away from things like counterintelligence and eliminating illegal Chinese ops on American (as well as Canadian) soil to other "priorities."  

Lamentable.
