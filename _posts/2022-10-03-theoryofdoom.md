### 362: [Azerbaijanis executing Armenian POWs. NSFL üîû](https://old.reddit.com/r/N_N_N/comments/xu2ao0/azerbaijanis_executing_armenian_pows_nsfl/), submitted on 2022-10-03 06:48:40+08:00.

----- __362.1__ -----2022-10-03 11:24:45+08:00:

No. Azerbaijanis act like Chechen terrorists.

----- __362.2__ -----2022-10-06 02:35:05+08:00:

Would be even better if Armenians were in a position to defend themselves from Azerbaijani war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression in general.

----- __362.3__ -----2022-10-06 08:47:57+08:00:

This is all a tragedy and it is unconscionable.   Russia is in a very difficult situation with Armenia because if they start pouring munitions into that country, the United States State Department will do the same with Azerbaijan.  For this reason, Moscow correctly understands that they would only be pouring gas on the fire.

The only way this stops is when Azerbaijan and Turkey pay an unacceptably high price for their past war crimes and crimes against humanity.  I am out of step with the State Department on this and I have no reservations whatsoever about saying it. 

What Azerbaijan and Turkey are doing is egregious.  It is intolerable in any civilized world.  And it must be stopped.

### 363: [How China and its allies pool resources to target overseas dissidents: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and Interpol are commonly used to pursue political opponents overseas.](https://old.reddit.com/r/politicalwarfare/comments/xvzoqz/how_china_and_its_allies_pool_resources_to_target/), submitted on 2022-10-05 11:43:54+08:00.

----- __363.1__ -----2022-10-06 02:13:49+08:00:

I think I posted about this in r/crime a while back.  The DOJ was all over this under the prior administration.

----- __363.2__ -----2022-10-06 02:19:57+08:00:

The current administration appears to have pivoted resources away from things like counterintelligence and eliminating illegal Chinese ops on American (as well as Canadian) soil to other "priorities."  

Lamentable.

### 364: [David Hogg: We must make an example out of Putin in Ukraine to stop him from rebuilding the USSR](https://old.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/xwjmi1/david_hogg_we_must_make_an_example_out_of_putin/), submitted on 2022-10-06 03:19:31+08:00.

----- __364.1__ -----2022-10-06 09:36:59+08:00:

Let's draft David Hogg to go fight the war he clearly wants. 

I do not understand the American fascination with stupid kids, such as Hogg, who say stupid things, such as [this](https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/1577628899785117696?s=19).

### 365: [Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov ‚Äòpromoted‚Äô to general by Putin](https://old.reddit.com/r/politicalwarfare/comments/xxk3c8/chechen_warlord_ramzan_kadyrov_promoted_to/), submitted on 2022-10-07 07:53:55+08:00.

----- __365.1__ -----2022-10-07 07:54:28+08:00:

Kadyrov is to Russia what Uday Saddam Hussein was to Iraq.

### 366: [Aparece OVNI en Valle Hermoso Tamaulipas](https://old.reddit.com/r/N_N_N/comments/xxmhob/aparece_ovni_en_valle_hermoso_tamaulipas/), submitted on 2022-10-07 09:50:55+08:00.

### 367: [The CIA Thought Putin Would Quickly Conquer Ukraine. Why Did They Get It So Wrong?](https://old.reddit.com/r/politicalwarfare/comments/xxnlia/the_cia_thought_putin_would_quickly_conquer/), submitted on 2022-10-07 10:45:40+08:00.

----- __367.1__ -----2022-10-07 10:49:13+08:00:

> ‚ÄúThere was no reporting on the corruption in the Russian system,‚Äù said the former senior intelligence official. ‚ÄúThey missed it, and ignored any evidence of it.‚Äù

You miss 100% of what you can't see.  And the United States couldn't see much of anything, because on an overreliance on sigint at the expense of actual targeting by actual operatives in denied areas.

### 368: [r/worldnews removing all posts about an ex-cop who murdered 24 children at a preschool in Thailand](https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditCensorship/comments/xxqhe5/rworldnews_removing_all_posts_about_an_excop_who/), submitted on 2022-10-07 13:18:17+08:00.

----- __368.1__ -----2022-10-08 00:27:52+08:00:

/r/worldnews is moderated by a group who consistently use their position to push their own agenda or the narratives that Reddit desires to promulgate.  That a person has shown a passt propensity to do so is often the deciding factor in whether they are even invited to moderate.  

Many of the moderators on /r/worldnews and other such subs also moderate other subs as well, where they do the same thing. In this way, Reddit functions in much the same way as Twitter to create an illusory "consensus reality," enforced by banning or removing any and all who state anything else. 

It's not so much a "hive mind" as a cultivated information ecosystem.

----- __368.2__ -----2022-10-08 14:07:47+08:00:

Thai tourist industry, for example.  I'm not inclined to speculate, though.

### 369: [FBI and CISA Publish a PSA on Information Manipulation Tactics for 2022 Midterm Elections](https://old.reddit.com/r/ElectionInterference/comments/xz1cr7/fbi_and_cisa_publish_a_psa_on_information/), submitted on 2022-10-09 03:30:19+08:00.

----- __369.1__ -----2022-10-09 12:41:39+08:00:

The underlying Public Service Announcement seems to have been removed:
