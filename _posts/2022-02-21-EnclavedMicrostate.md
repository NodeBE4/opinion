### 148: [What is up with #不知火フレア3D新ビジュアルお披露目 popping up on Twitter's trending list?](https://old.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sx4z3o/what_is_up_with_不知火フレア3d新ビジュアルお披露目_popping_up_on/), submitted on 2022-02-21 00:26:56+08:00.

----- __148.1__ -----2022-02-21 12:08:56+08:00:

I think the best way of conceptualising Hololive fandom is as anime fandom being applied to a group of streamers. So yes, the level of lewd art is exceptionally high if your point of reference is IRL streamer fandoms, but it's pretty typical by anime fandom standards.

----- __148.2__ -----2022-02-21 12:54:04+08:00:

It depends on the individual. Gaming is almost ubiquitous, but some will do gaming streams nigh-exclusively while others only do it as a portion of their content, with the rest being some combination of chatting, art, music, clip/meme reviews, and the like. There do tend to be trends for certain groups: Hololive, to which Shiranui Flare belongs, tends to be a bit more overtly diversified in terms of content, so for instance while Flare mostly does gaming streams, she also does a (relatively) high proportion of karaoke streams, averaging around one a week. Probably the best representative of Hololive's 'variety entertainment' style would be Hololive English's Mori Calliope, who until recently streamed basically constantly and who does a pretty big variety of stuff: gaming streams obviously, but also a lot of music and chatting, occasional art, a podcast with a couple of other Hololive English members, and also English learning streams with some of Hololive's Japanese members. Members of VShojo, which is the main English-language VTuber group on Twitch, don't emphasise music and art content to the same extent, but they're not absent outright.

----- __148.3__ -----2022-02-21 13:07:40+08:00:

To put it a better way, all of them stream video games but they also do other things. Hololive in particular still brands itself mainly as a variety entertainment agency rather than just video game streamers, so its members have a strong emphasis on music (as well as other, more individual content) aside from just gaming. A large part of this is because Japanese VTubing drew in not just gaming content creators but also utaite (cover singers) and amateur idols, where music had been their primary content to begin with, though in Hololive's case in particular there's also an explicit 'idol group' angle and aesthetic involved just to hit it home a bit harder. Even so it's not just Hololive doing concerts, Nijisanji (the next biggest agency) also does them even without the overt idol theme.

----- __148.4__ -----2022-02-21 13:27:49+08:00:

There's a lot of Coco hero-worship particularly in relation to Hololive English, but according to Hololive's own staff, the process of forming Hololive English had started months before Coco's debut, as part of a general international expansion plan that had begun with the (now-defunct) Chinese branch and the (still active) Indonesian branch over late 2019-early 2020. Coco was a big signal booster for HoloEN, but not its originator by any means. She was definitely a particularly engaged member who gave a lot of support to fellow Hololive members and that is worth celebrating, but the notion that she was Hololive's Atlas holding up the sky really understates the initiative of talents and staff alike.

----- __148.5__ -----2022-02-21 17:58:40+08:00:

So obviously it's far from certain, but there are a few things: 

* Hololive started an EN Twitter back in November 2019. To be fair, it also created a Korean account two months later that has been dormant ever since, so it's not a *firm* indication that a branch was in development, but it's an aspect of it.

* Hololive was rolling out new international branches every few months, with an obvious delay of sorts owing to COVID, but it would be at least plausible that EN would be 'in the works' so to speak but not actively pursued until CN and ID debuted. There's a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Holostars/comments/r9a5pt/my_thoughts_on_the_debut_of_holox_and_what_i/) which obviously is just another Redditor's speculation, but they suggest that because ID requires English fluency, ID and EN share or shared a hiring team that alternated between the two branches, which is why there were such gaps between the first two generations of both branches. To put it another way there was definitely work being done on an English-*language* branch well before Coco's involvement.

* On the sub count thing, Fubuki was at over 300k by the end of 2019 and Sora had been coasting at around 250k for a while, so it was definitely not out of the question to pursue international expansion, especially given they were already doing CN and ID by the end of 2019.

* As for the year in advance, there's a [slightly odd article](https://grapee.jp/en/169910) involving a supposed interview with an anonymous head producer for HoloEN in early 2021 saying that things are planned out about a year ahead when it comes to EN, which isn't clear should be extrapolated all the way back to mean that HoloEN was in the works as early as September 2019, but it definitely *could* be.

As noted, much of this is necessarily speculative because Cover doesn't just leak info constantly, but considering that new debuts at Hololive do generally take quite a long time to prepare, it does seem pretty reasonable to suggest that there was a plan to create HoloEN by late 2019 at the latest.

Depends which harassment: the long story short is the girl's fans mostly harassed the guy and vice versa.

----- __148.7__ -----2022-02-23 11:25:13+08:00:

> only one brought in wholesale from her prior company.

Not quite, she had started as an indie, signed on with an agency briefly, and then left again a good while before getting into Hololive.

### 152: [Mindless Monday, 21 February 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/sxrv30/mindless_monday_21_february_2022/), submitted on 2022-02-21 20:00:16+08:00.

----- __152.1__ -----2022-02-23 11:14:32+08:00:

Without trying to start a slapfight, I feel like that critique principally consists of quibbling over interpreting some admittedly ambiguous wording on Invicta's part that doesn't actually impinge on the content that much. The fact is, we *don't* know where the Immortals were garrisoned, how they were recruited, or how they were trained. We know that there were *some* troops stationed in the vicinity of the palace, but not which; we know that the Immortals were recruited from the Persian population, but not on what basis; and we know that Persian nobles had some degree of individual martial training from birth, but not if they trained as a unit (nor, moreover, if the non-noble Persians making up the bulk of the royal corps had comparable individual training to the nobles). The remainder of the critique seems to be based on the idea that we ought to take Herodotos as precisely correct in all details at face value, rather than even allowing the possibility of a 'may' in there. Granted, Herodotos is also pretty unambiguous that all but one of the Immortals did stay behind for Plataiai, so that is a goof, but by and large the majority of objections are to the presence of the word 'may' at all.

----- __152.2__ -----2022-02-24 13:25:53+08:00:

> it seems unlikely to me that the 10’000 immortals, who are constantly being replaced, we’re all aristocrats.

Indeed not, and in fact we can quote Herodotos (7.41) here to show it: 

> Behind him came a thousand spearmen of the best and noblest blood of Persia, carrying their spears in the customary manner; after them a thousand picked Persian horsemen, and after the horse ten thousand that were footmen, chosen out of the rest of the Persians. One thousand of these latter bore golden pomegranates on their spear-shafts in place of the spike, and surrounded the rest; the nine thousand were enclosed within, and bore silver pomegranates; they that held their spears reversed carried golden pomegranates also, and they that were nearest to Xerxes, apples of gold. After the ten thousand came ten thousand Persian horsemen in array. After these there was a space of two furlongs, and next the rest of the multitude followed without order or division.

So, in what we might term the 'royal corps' of Persian standing troops, 1000 (the spearmen in the vanguard) were recruited from the nobility, 1000 (the cavalry) are implied to have been the same, and 20,000 (10,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry) were recruited from the Persian population writ large.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.

A bit of a general question, but how far would you say that video games about the First World War have helped improve the public's understanding, especially in terms of challenging existing narratives in popular culture?

Given that Kiara seems to have known the night before, it's more likely that some basic gist was known to EN but that the full details were not disclosed until the day of.

This submission has been removed because it violates our ['20-Year Rule'](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events). To discourage off-topic discussions of current events, questions, answers, and all other comments must be confined to events that happened 20 years ago or more.

Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.
 
So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).

Given that Sora is something like the 7th VTuber to debut if we start counting from Ai-chan, they are very much from the same early era, even if from different agencies and with different backgrounds.
