### 146: [What is up with #不知火フレア3D新ビジュアルお披露目 popping up on Twitter's trending list?](https://old.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sx4z3o/what_is_up_with_不知火フレア3d新ビジュアルお披露目_popping_up_on/), submitted on 2022-02-21 00:26:56+08:00.

I think the best way of conceptualising Hololive fandom is as anime fandom being applied to a group of streamers. So yes, the level of lewd art is exceptionally high if your point of reference is IRL streamer fandoms, but it's pretty typical by anime fandom standards.

It depends on the individual. Gaming is almost ubiquitous, but some will do gaming streams nigh-exclusively while others only do it as a portion of their content, with the rest being some combination of chatting, art, music, clip/meme reviews, and the like. There do tend to be trends for certain groups: Hololive, to which Shiranui Flare belongs, tends to be a bit more overtly diversified in terms of content, so for instance while Flare mostly does gaming streams, she also does a (relatively) high proportion of karaoke streams, averaging around one a week. Probably the best representative of Hololive's 'variety entertainment' style would be Hololive English's Mori Calliope, who until recently streamed basically constantly and who does a pretty big variety of stuff: gaming streams obviously, but also a lot of music and chatting, occasional art, a podcast with a couple of other Hololive English members, and also English learning streams with some of Hololive's Japanese members. Members of VShojo, which is the main English-language VTuber group on Twitch, don't emphasise music and art content to the same extent, but they're not absent outright.

To put it a better way, all of them stream video games but they also do other things. Hololive in particular still brands itself mainly as a variety entertainment agency rather than just video game streamers, so its members have a strong emphasis on music (as well as other, more individual content) aside from just gaming. A large part of this is because Japanese VTubing drew in not just gaming content creators but also utaite (cover singers) and amateur idols, where music had been their primary content to begin with, though in Hololive's case in particular there's also an explicit 'idol group' angle and aesthetic involved just to hit it home a bit harder. Even so it's not just Hololive doing concerts, Nijisanji (the next biggest agency) also does them even without the overt idol theme.

There's a lot of Coco hero-worship particularly in relation to Hololive English, but according to Hololive's own staff, the process of forming Hololive English had started months before Coco's debut, as part of a general international expansion plan that had begun with the (now-defunct) Chinese branch and the (still active) Indonesian branch over late 2019-early 2020. Coco was a big signal booster for HoloEN, but not its originator by any means. She was definitely a particularly engaged member who gave a lot of support to fellow Hololive members and that is worth celebrating, but the notion that she was Hololive's Atlas holding up the sky really understates the initiative of talents and staff alike.

To be fair, they did try with Wizards of the Coast.
