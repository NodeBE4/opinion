  The 2018 World Cup is fast approaching, with national sides making their final preparations ahead of this summer's tournament.
 </p>
<p>
  We now know the groups after December's draw. England have been put together with Belgium, Tunisia and Panama in Group G.
 </p>
<p>
  Gareth Southgate's side were not among the top seeds, meaning they featured in pot two during the proceedings.
 </p>
<p>
  And with England's route now mapped out, Southgate will be able to ramp up preparations for the 2018 tournament.
