### 302: [The Unkept Promises of Western Aid: How Donor Countries Cook Their Books and Let Down the Developing World](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/xeau0x/the_unkept_promises_of_western_aid_how_donor/), submitted on 2022-09-15 03:26:26+08:00.

\[SS from the essay by Ian Mitchell, Co-Director of Development Cooperation in Europe and Nancy Birdsall, President Emeritus and Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development.\]

\[In\] truth, wealthy Western donor countries are not always honest about the assistance they provide. They find ways to exaggerate their real commitments through creative and dubious accounting practices meant to expand the definition of development-aid spending. And when it comes to the other category of assistance that wealthy countries owe to developing ones—finance to help the global South mitigate and adapt to climate change—rich countries fall egregiously short of what they have pledged, which is in turn tragically short of what poorer ones need.  
These shortcomings on development aid and climate finance undermine the credibility of Western donors and hurt the United States and its allies in their competition with China for influence around the world. Moreover, they disguise meaningful deficits in the resources that developing countries need to make progress and address the climate crisis. To live up to its values and promises—and to not cede the field to China—the West must be honest and serious about its development-aid and climate-finance commitments.
