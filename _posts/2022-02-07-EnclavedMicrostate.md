So, this is not purely a question about political popularity in a vacuum thanks to the clarification you've added. Indeed, when you interrogate the specifics, it ends up kind of turning into two separate questions, one about the popularity of the Qing, and the other about empire and decolonisation.

With regards to the former, the answer is difficult and complex. There were no opinion polls assessing the popularity of the monarchy, nor any way of really definitively breaking down which regions were more or less pro-Qing than others. We can, quite fairly, say that at least among elite intellectuals – note, these were not a hereditary nobility as such – there was a broad opposition to the Qing monarchy *as it had then existed*, in the sense of an absolute monarchy unconstrained by any form of constitutional law, and operating with an implicit pro-Manchu ethnic bias. But this was not a uniform response.

Over the course of the 1890s and 1900s, in effect two political tendencies, not entirely in opposition nor entirely in concert, emerged: Republicanism and Constitutionalism. Constitutionalism does not *necessarily* mean constitutional *monarchism*; rather, Constitutionalists sought to establish the rule of law in China, with a government ultimately based on a binding constitutional document or documents that clearly delineated the powers and responsibilities of various branches of government, and which transcended any individual act of arbitrary power. This could be achieved under a monarchy, but also under a republic, and many Constitutionalist leaders of the later Qing carried over into the early republic with considerable influence. The most prominent of these figures was Liang Qichao, who had been one of the major leaders in the abortive Constitutionalist reform movement of 1898, and escaped to Japan after the crackdown against the reformers initiated by Dowager Empress Cixi. Republicans, on the other hand, were not necessarily committed to any sort of deeper philosophical basis of government and statehood; they mainly just wanted the Qing gone and a new, Han Chinese-dominated regime installed in its stead.

These two tendencies ended up appealing to slightly different groups. Both, of course, had considerable appeal among globally-connected intellectuals who wanted to see China 'modernise' along the lines of Japan, but when it came to penetrating further down the social scale, there were some differences. Republicanism became especially prominent in the Qing military, which was effectively the centrepiece of the empire's 'modernisation' efforts. But Constitutionalism, or dimensions thereof, managed to gain a certain broad-base appeal, most prominently in Sichuan, where 1910-11 saw considerable controversies and protests – eventually boiling over into the final set of crises precipitating the revolution – over the role of foreign loans in railway construction, amid a general spread of a sense of 'popular sovereignty' whereby those outside the traditional system of government demanded a greater say in its running. But that doesn't translate directly to agitating for the Qing to be overthrown.

The broad conclusion in recent historiography on 1911 – though with some versions of the argument going back to at least 1975, when Edward Rhoads' study of Guangdong in 1911 was published – is that the fall of the Qing was mostly to do with a series of disastrous, credibility-incinerating decisions made in 1911, rather than the unintended yet predictable effect of the New Policies instituted after the Boxer Uprising. As Rhoads and others have argued, the New Policies did successfully open up avenues for Han Chinese elites to participate more directly in government, and ultimately did succeed in creating elected provincial assemblies in 1909 and a national assembly in October 1910, although for the time being their role would be principally advisory. On the whole, by acceding to constitutionalist demands, the Qing effectively won over, or at least appeased, the elites agitating for political reform. When Sun Yat-Sen's republicans tried to launch a revolt in Guangdong in April 1911, it failed to win over much support at all and ultimately proved an utter disaster, and the Revolutionary Alliance was left in disarray for several months, undergoing a major schism.

Ironically, had the Republicans just waited a month, things might have gone differently. Zaifeng, the Prince Regent and father of the young Xuantong Emperor, had been courting controversy ever since November 1910, when he had declared that the Qing would not create a parliament with real political power until 1913, such that the National Assembly would sit for a full four-year term. Many elites, including a caucus within the National Assembly, called on the Qing to establish a parliament by 1911, which Zaifeng adamantly refused to commit to. Then, in December, Zaifeng refused to ratify a bill passed by the Assembly legalising queue-cutting and also making it mandatory for civil servants, police officers, and members of the military. In May 1911, he assembled a cabinet whose thirteen members included only four Han Chinese, compared to nine Manchus of whom seven came from the imperial Aisin Gioro clan, which proved to be one of the last straws on the camel's back when it came to the credibility of the Qing court's commitment to reform. While the immediate spark that lit the revolutionary fire would be a bungled bomb plot in Wuchang by a revolutionary cell in the army sympathetic to the Sichuan railway protestors, it was the failure of the Qing court firstly to firmly commit to political reform on a timetable desirous to the reformists, and then to apparently make a mockery of the whole process, which rapidly alienated not just reformist elites, but indeed to some extent a reform-minded public.

One thing I have generally only touched on in the above answer is anti-Manchuism, in part because it is somewhat hard to work into a relatively potted summary, and in part because it does deserve its own discussion. The simple fact is that the foreign origin of the Qing is an unavoidable aspect of late Qing political discourse. While many Constitutionalists believed that the Aisin Gioro clan could retain control of the throne under a constitutional monarchy, they nevertheless called for the dissolution of wider structures of Manchu-centric ethnic sovereignty. Some of an overtly Social Darwinist tendency, especially Liang Qichao, went a step further and advocated for the forcible miscegenation of Manchus with Han Chinese so as to subsume the former into the latter. More broadly, Han Chinese anti-Manchuism was rooted in the notion of Manchus as an 'inferior' people whose apparent position of dominance over the Han was aberrant not because *any* such ethnic hierarchy was unjust, but rather because the Han *ought* to be in charge over the Manchus and indeed all other minority peoples encompassed by the Qing Empire. The ethnic issue was thus one in which there was very little middle ground between Manchu privilege and Han supremacism.

It's hard to speak of a significant north-south division in revolutionary sentiments; while the areas immediately closer to Beijing didn't revolt, many northern cities, most notably Xi'an, did. Xi'an stands out also as a particularly violent case, with some 20,000 Manchus in the Banner quarter being massacred by the rebels. But, looking at The Mad Monarchist's (probable) blog post in question, that isn't the point they seem to be going for. Instead, their argument seems to be that the 1911 Revolution should, in theory, simply have detached the Han Chinese – and indeed any other rebelling populations – from Manchu rule, with the Manchus free to retain their own government in Manchuria itself. Now, this is broadly a moralistic argument, and one which is not really my job as a historian to discuss. But I can discuss the practicalities involved in why that didn't happen.

Firstly, we need to appreciate that an independent Manchu state under Aisin Gioro rule was not really a *practical* possibility even if it had been desirous for the revolutionaries. Manchuria or the Northeast (the terminology here is... complicated and worth its own question) simply was not majority-Manchu, for one. Since the 1850s, there had been a considerable migration of Han Chinese settlers as the Qing opted to do away with its previous policy of quarantining Han settlement amid a perceived need to bolster Qing control of the region amid major Russian encroachments, and to redevelop its economy in the wake of the collapse of the government monopoly on wild ginseng due to over-harvesting. Critically, these settlers were not only an overall numerical majority, they were also distributed quite widely across the region, with a particularly large concentration in Harbin/Halbin in the northern part. Going in the other direction, most Manchus lived in various garrison quarters in China proper, principally in Beijing, with only a little over a sixth in Manchuria. So, not only would an independent Manchuria be mostly Han, it would also exclude the vast majority of Manchus, unless there was a considerable effort at deliberate resettlement in both directions. That doesn't inherently legitimise (Han) Chinese claims to Manchuria territorially, but they do explain why, even if entertained, a Manchu nation-state in Manchuria simply was not a practicable outcome.

Secondly, the extent of Manchu ties to the monarchy are... a bit questionable, and there are two angles to it. Pamela Crossley, looking at provincial Banner garrisons, has argued that Manchu identity in the late 19th century coalesced out of a reaction to *abandonment* by the imperial court, as provincial garrisons became increasingly destitute and politically irrelevant amid the rise of modernised, Han-dominated provincial armies. Edward Rhoads, looking at the court, would argue that the majority of Manchus, being based in the main concentration in Beijing, benefitted considerably from continued attention by the court, albeit attention that was weighted towards the imperial clan and its cadet lines. As such, it's not entirely clear that all or even most Manchus were themselves necessarily monarchists by 1911.

Thirdly, we need to look at the reformist agenda itself, where again, there were distinct views over how the Qing empire (small-e) should be dealt with in the absence of the Qing Empire (big-E). There were some, such as Zhang Binglin, who advocated for what might in effect be termed decolonisation, and argued that non-Han peoples under Qing rule, such as Tibetans, Mongols, Turkic Muslims (antecedents to today's Uyghurs), and indeed Manchus should have the right to self-rule, same as the Han, should Qing rule be overthrown. However, it is important to understand that this was not benevolent but based fundamentally on racist thinking: for Zhang, Han and 'barbarians' should never have been mixed, and self-rule for 'barbarian' peoples was good not because it benefitted them, but because it essentially cast dead weight off the Han so as to allow all parties to reach their own destinies, which for the Han lay in greater 'civilisation' than could be achieved if shackled to 'lesser' peoples. A similar underlying invective motivated what we might euphemistically term 'paternalist' approaches which ended up being dominant among those who gained power after 1911, in which it was the apparent destiny of the Han Chinese to 'uplift' and/or to assimilate – literally, eugenically – the 'lesser' peoples who had 'become part of China' through the Qing empire, and so even in the absence of the Qing, the wider empire ought to be carried over into the new, Han Chinese-dominated state.

It is thus not entirely wrong to say that claims to Manchuria by the ROC and PRC are ultimately rooted in discourses attempting to reconcile ethnic nationalism with imperialism, nor to say that the Manchus very much did not have a choice in 1911. This of course has no bearing on the broader ideology of monarchism, especially in its present-day form, but, and it surprises me to say it, there is a vague kernel of truth to The Mad Monarchist's suggestion, however tendentious, that there was a certain incongruity, even hypocrisy, between Han demands for self-rule in 1911, and yet also Han claims to overrule similar claims among other former imperial subjects.
