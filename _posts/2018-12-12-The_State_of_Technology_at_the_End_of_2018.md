   This article is a bit of an annual tradition: in mid-December I summarize the state of technology,
   <a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" href="#footnote_0_3849" id="identifier_0_3849" title="Here is 2014, 2015, and 2016; I skipped it last year in order to cover Disney‚Äôs acquisition of 21st Century Fox ">

   </a>
   and appropriately enough, this year‚Äôs edition coincides with a tech executive testifying in front of Congress. This time the executive was Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, and on the surface, it was more of the same;

    Casey Newton wrote

   <p>
    From time to time the entire technology press corps gets together on Twitter, spends several hours live-tweeting the same event, and then writes a series of blog posts about how nothing important happened. This event is known as a Congressional hearing, and today we witnessed our final one of the year.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Newton‚Äôs pithy summary, though, missed one essential part of the script: the Twitterati complaining about just how stupid members of Congress are:

  <p>
   It‚Äôs hard to deny Ohanian the point: Congressman Lamar Smith‚Äôs line of questioning was ‚Äî and I swear this is exactly what I wrote in my notes as I watched
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfbTbPEEJxI">
    the hearing

   ‚Äî ‚Äúfreaking delusional‚Äù.

  <h4>
   Smith Versus Pichai
  </h4>
  <p>
   Congressman Smith, like many of his Republican colleagues, was concerned about Google being biased against Conservatives;
   <a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" href="#footnote_2_3849" id="identifier_2_3849" title="The capitalization is intentional, in reference to the distinct American political movement">
    3
   </a>
   Congressman Smith stated:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Google has revolutionized the world, though not entirely in the way I expected. Americans deserve the facts objectively reported. The muting of conservative voices by Internet platforms has intensified, especially during the Presidency of Donald Trump. More than 90% of all Internet searches take place on Google or YouTube and they are curating what we see. Google has long faced criticism for manipulating search results to censor Conservatives. Organizations have had pro-Trump content tagged as hate speech or had content reduced in search results. Enforcement of immigration laws has been tagged as hate speech as well. Such actions pose a grave threat to our democratic form of government. PJ Media found 96% of search results for Trump were from liberal media outlets. In fact, not a single right-leaning site appeared on the first page of results. This doesn‚Äôt happen by accident, but is baked into the algorithm. Google‚Äôs algorithms‚Ä¶It will require a herculean effort in senior management to change the political bias now programmed into the company‚Äôs culture.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Pichai, as he did throughout the hearing, explained that Google did not manipulate search results for partisan ends, and that it would it not be in their business interest to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is, to be clear, correct: Google‚Äôs business is perhaps the most perfect example of a capital-intensive tech company there has ever been. The company spends huge amounts of money on research-and-development and back-end infrastructure for the sake of offering services and advertisements that have zero marginal costs. It follows, then, that the company is heavily incentivized to serve as many users as possible; being purposely biased against approximately 50% of them would be illogical.
  </p>
  <p>
   Congressman Smith, though, was not convinced, leading to the exchange Ohanian highlighted:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Congressman Smith:
    </strong>
    To my knowledge, you have never sanctioned any employee for any type of manipulating the search results whatsoever. Is that the case?
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Pichai:
    </strong>
    It‚Äôs not possible for an individual employee to manipulate the search results. We have a robust framework including many steps in the process.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Congressman Smith:
    </strong>
    I disagree. I think they can manipulate the process.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   I mean, what are you supposed to say to that? Any person that works at Google ‚Äî indeed, any person that has worked in any technology company of even the slightest scale ‚Äî knows that it would be impossible for a rogue employee to manipulate search results. Good luck, though, convincing Congressman Smith.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Google‚Äôs Impregnability
  </h4>
  <p>
   Still, as a thought experiment, suppose Congressman Smith were right, and that Google‚Äôs search results, whether via managerial decree, general employee bias, or rogue employee, were gamed to disfavor Conservatives. The solution seems clear: create a competitor to serve the part of the market that is dissatisfied with Google. After all, this is a company that made $110 billion in revenue and $27 billion in pre-tax income;
   <a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" href="#footnote_3_3849" id="identifier_3_3849" title="Google took a special charge related to the recent tax law last year, artificially lowering its net income to $12.6 billion">
    4
   </a>
   big profits mean a big opportunity for competitors, right? So what is Congressman Smith complaining about?
  </p>
  <p>
   The issue, of course, is that Google is, at least for a while (and more on this in a bit), impregnable: the company is an
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">
    Aggregator
   </a>
   with positive feedback loops everywhere:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A superior search product earns users, leading to more data and more supply that leads to better results, earning more users.
   </li>
   <li>
    Superior ad inventory that attracts advertisers, leading to more data that, when combined with aggregated users, leads to more inventory that is (justifiably) more expensive than alternatives, resulting in outsized revenue and profits.
   </li>
   <li>
    Outsized revenue and profits make it possible to acquire complementary companies (like DoubleClick), new sources of growth (like YouTube), and invest massively in research and development (for products like Android and TensorFlow), all of which serve to accelerate the first two feedback loops.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The result is that consumers ‚Äî whatever their political affiliation or feelings about bias ‚Äî use Google because it is the best option, and, for all of Google‚Äôs technical brilliance, its insurmountable ‚Äúbestness‚Äù is, at this point in the company‚Äôs history, more due to the frictionless structure of the Internet, with its zero distribution and transaction costs that make it possible for a company to achieve Google‚Äôs insurmountable scale, than it is due to any sort of unique innovation.
  </p>
  <h4>
   The Cost of Dominance
  </h4>
  <p>
   But still, so what? Google offers tremendously valuable services for no direct cost to consumers. What‚Äôs the problem? It is certainly hard for the American antitrust community to find any, thanks to the consumer welfare standard: Google is not raising prices for consumers, they are lowering them, in basically every market they enter.
  </p>
  <p>
   The question that must be asked, though, is at what cost? This year‚Äôs set of Congressional hearings suggest that one casualty is any sort of effective government oversight: a lack of competition for not just Google but also Facebook, particularly in terms of digital advertising, combined with an antitrust philosophy stripped of even a shred of suspicion about sheer size and the political and economic power that inevitably follow, means politicians are left with little recourse other than vague references to regulations that will only entrench the two consumer tech giants at best, and Smith-style conspiracy theories at worst (and, I‚Äôd note, it is not as if Progressives are thrilled about Google and Facebook‚Äôs content moderation policies and algorithms either).
  </p>
  <p>
   Equally concerning is the innovation that is
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   happening: venture investment in seed rounds and initial follow-ons
   <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/06/02/american-tech-giants-are-making-life-tough-for-startups">
    is down considerably
   </a>
   , and numerous studies (like
   <a href="http://www.ianhathaway.org/blog/2018/10/12/platform-giants-and-venture-backed-startups">
    here
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/18-036_4f138a21-000c-44ac-a7c4-1acef3265ab1.pdf">
    here
   </a>
   , and
   <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2533616">
    here
   </a>
   ) show that most of the decline is in the consumer space ‚Äî i.e. the domain of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple (I wrote about Apple‚Äôs problematic App Store
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/">
    two weeks ago
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreover, the VC-backed tech industry knows better than anyone that this is not because large companies, with their top-down decision-making, are inherently better at innovation. The goal of venture capital is to make multiple bets on ideas with extremely uncertain outcomes, because the best way to figure out what works is to let the market decide, not mid-level managers. That strategy, though, isn‚Äôt nearly as successful if the market isn‚Äôt functioning correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contrast, consider the enterprise software market: here the Internet has very much lived up to its billing, unleashing a torrent of innovative companies made possible by cloud computing, that are challenging lumbering incumbents up-and-down their product lines. And, to their credit, some of those incumbents, like Microsoft, are responding in kind, dramatically overhauling their core strategies and releasing new products and services that are innovative in their own right. Small wonder both venture capital investment and the IPO market are dominated by these enterprise startups: functioning markets have positive feedback loops of their own.
  </p>
  <h4>
   The State of Technology
  </h4>
  <p>
   This, then, is the state of technology in 2018: the enterprise market is thriving, and the consumer market is stagnant, dominated by the ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù that a few large behemoths deign to develop for consumers (probably by
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/facebook-and-the-cost-of-monopoly/">
    ripping off
   </a>
   a smaller company). Meanwhile a backlash is brewing on both sides of the political spectrum, but with no immediately viable outlet through competition or antitrust action, the politics surrounding technology simply becomes ever more rancid.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, some might argue, this moment may soon pass: just look at Microsoft. I praised them above for their new-found competitiveness, driven by the fundamental shift wrought by the combination of cloud computing and mobile that obviated their PC monopoly-based business model. Surely Google‚Äôs dominance will soon pass, just like Microsoft‚Äôs did, right?
  </p>
  <p>
   I‚Äôm not so sure.
  </p>
  <h4>
   The Internet Age
  </h4>
  <p>
   The single most important factor in the loosening of Microsoft‚Äôs monopoly was the Internet. Suddenly applications could be run and data could be stored in a way that was independent of the underlying operating system, undoing Microsoft‚Äôs platform lock-in.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   This didn‚Äôt affect Microsoft immediately ‚Äî people were already accustomed to buying PCs (although it is not solely because of Steve Jobs‚Äô return that the Mac‚Äôs fortunes increased in line with Internet penetration) ‚Äî but it created an ecosystem that made a device like the iPhone, with its groundbreaking browsing capabilities, immediately useful in a way it wouldn‚Äôt have been otherwise. That attracted consumers, which attracted developers to the App Store, and the rest is history.
  </p>
  <p>
   That story extended to enterprise: not only were more and more line-of-business applications delivered via the cloud, but new companies providing services that competed with Microsoft were far quicker to support mobile, providing a compelling reason to switch, unwrapping Microsoft‚Äôs bundle and opening the door to new companies of all types.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again, though, all of this was because of the Internet, a paradigm shift that I have repeatedly
   <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/friction/">
    likened to the Industrial Revolution
   </a>
   in the profound impact I expect it to have when all is said-and-done. How often, though, do such paradigm shifts actually happen? Yes, the Internet saved the industry from Microsoft, but are we so sure another Internet-level shift, one that will upend Google‚Äôs dominance, is on the horizon?

   And how much foregone innovation and political dysfunction are we willing to suffer in the meantime?
