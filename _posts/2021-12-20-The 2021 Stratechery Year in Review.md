[The 2021 Stratechery Year in Review](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-2021-stratechery-year-in-review/)
------

<div>
<p>There is a perspective in which 2021 was an absolute drag: COVID dragged on, vaccines became politicized, new variants emerged, and while tech continued to provide the infrastructure that kept the economy moving, it also provided the infrastructure for all of those things that made this year feel so difficult.</p><p>At the same time, 2021 also provided a glimpse of a future beyond our current smartphone and social media-dominated paradigm: there was the Metaverse, and crypto, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/the-great-bifurcation/">my contention they are related</a>. Sure, the old paradigm is increasingly dominated by regulation and politics, a topic that is so soul-sucking that it temporarily made me want to post less, but the brilliance of the Internet, and of business-models like that which undergirds Stratechery, is that freedom to not only write what you want, but build what you want, and be what you want, is greater than ever.</p><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/internet30-2.png?resize=640%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="A drawing of Internet 3.0 and Open Protocols" width="640" height="483" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5531" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/internet30-2.png?resize=1024%2C772&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/internet30-2.png?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/internet30-2.png?resize=768%2C579&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/internet30-2.png?resize=836%2C630&amp;ssl=1 836w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/internet30-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p><p>This year Stratechery published 40 free Weekly Articles and 121 Daily Updates, including 13 interviews.
