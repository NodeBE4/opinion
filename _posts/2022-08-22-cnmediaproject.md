RT Alexander Boyd<br>Marxist theory is interesting because it'll lead you to proudly declare you were the first slave-holding society on earth in an effort to boost your historical confidence <a href="http://www.qstheory.cn/dukan/hqwg/2022-08/10/c_1128903526.htm?spm=zm5062-001.0.0.1.tdEcYU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.qstheory.cn/dukan/hqwg/2022-08/10/c_1128903526.htm?spm=zm5062-001.0.0.1.tdEcYU</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fa3eaFWWQAAE9Fz?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

In the race to the finish line of the 20th National Congress this fall, one key phrase denoting Xi Jinping's power is falling behind this week. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/24/tracing-the-two-establishes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/24/tracing-the-two-establishes/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fa6ZVkgaQAIyoXa?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Mary Hui<br>Re w/ thanks to @cnmediaproject for the data on the frequency of each phrase in People's Daily articles. "New normal," a Xi buzz phrase &amp; theory referring to rebalancing the economy towards "quality" growth," may have dropped off, but the challenge still very much remains<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fa7VboPVUAASdVh?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Pleased to have worked with Quartz on this interesting article about Chinese buzzwords like "new normal." <a href="https://qz.com/new-china-dictionary-entries-economic-goals-1849449903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://qz.com/new-china-dictionary-entries-economic-goals-1849449903</a>

Two articles mentioning "Two Establishes" today in the People's Daily. This key term for signaling Xi's power and position has been weak over the past 8 days. More in our latest CMP Newspeak article. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/24/tracing-the-two-establishes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/24/tracing-the-two-establishes/</a>

US House Speaker Pelosi has appeared in more than 70 articles in the CCP's flagship newspaper so far in August — stratospheric by historical standards. The latest outpouring of rage from China appears across two pages today. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/25/pelosi-in-the-peoples-daily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/25/pelosi-in-the-peoples-daily/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fa-e6lYaQAA7Hly?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re To put the number in context, the top foreign leader in the People’s Daily in July was Joe Biden, who appeared in just 9 articles. Pelosi is sure to far outpace all other foreign political figures in August, a reflection of just how much her visit infuriated and concerned China.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fa-fTFfaUAM2es8?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
