Xi has stressed traditional culture in "telling the China story." But why can't China find discourse power on a desert highway in the post-apocalyptic American West, where zombies and monsters must be dispatched through brutal combat? <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWwIb3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3tWwIb3</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJ7OYyUacAEXAtv?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Alex Dukalskis<br>Pet peeve: when people discussing diplomacy say "the Russians" want X or "the Americans" are doing Y or we can't get "the Chinese" to do Z. They're really talking about decisions by a very small number of state elites, not the collective wills of entire populations.

Promoting the "going out" of China's gaming industry is now seen by the CCP as an important way of "telling the China story well" and expanding global influence. We look at this trend (with a touch of fun) in "Gaming for the China Story." <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/25/gaming-for-the-china-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/25/gaming-for-the-china-story/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKEfi7zaQAMCKoA?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Meta-Propaganda In the Digital Age: As the CCP’s system of domestic propaganda changes to accommodate digital media developments, the story of this transformation is another success story for propagandists to tell. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/27/meta-propaganda-converges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/01/27/meta-propaganda-converges/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKGI0AnagAIqNRl?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re "Propaganda is deeply imbedded in the governance of the Party, its task to write the success story of every failure. And because propaganda is so essential to the Party’s vision of itself, it follows that propaganda too must be a success."

As the CCP has stressed the need to develop “convergence” within the state media ecosystem, Xi stressing that state media must advance and not be “marginalized," this has made for interesting – if not always compelling – hybrid forms of propaganda. <a href="https://bit.ly/3H7g2S6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3H7g2S6</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKGgUxhaMAIGHTn?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

RT Xifan Yang 杨希璠<br>Re 19/ This speaks volumes about the power of the CCP's censorship apparatus these days. And it unfortunately says much about the dire state China reporting is in.
