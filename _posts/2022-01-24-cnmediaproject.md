RT‚ÄÇAlex Dukalskis<br>Pet peeve: when people discussing diplomacy say "the Russians" want X or "the Americans" are doing Y or we can't get "the Chinese" to do Z. They're really talking about decisions by a very small number of state elites, not the collective wills of entire populations.

Promoting the "going out" of China's gaming industry is now seen by the CCP as an important way of "telling the China story well" and expanding global influence.
