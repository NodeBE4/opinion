### 723: [Africans were just as complicit in the slave trade as Europeans and should share the blame.](https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/azgx91/africans_were_just_as_complicit_in_the_slave/), submitted on 2019-03-10 23:48:52+08:00.

----- __723.1__ -----2019-03-11 05:49:18+08:00:

Although I'm Chinese (non-White), I stand with you here. When we were in the schools, the teachers always blame everything to the western imperialism and colonialism. 

But now, the more I learnt, the more I know that history is complicated and it's wrong to put all the things to one side being accountable.

So as the black slavery history. So as the Chinese Century of Humiliation. So as others.

清淡

----- __724.2__ -----2019-03-11 06:42:13+08:00:

我个人觉得“清淡”是相对的吧，你说得也没错。但东亚地区都是这个搭配的，跟韩国的泡菜和中国的重油（部分）重辣相比，日本很好了。就问你个问题，你觉得吃一顿日餐和中餐比，哪个摄入的酱料、脂肪等更加多？至于西方，红肉先不说，起码含糖量远远超标。

### 725: [Hello there, does anyone know which birds are represented in this character? It's from Yunnan. My guess would be a crane and a Heron. But it's just a guess. Thanks in advance](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/azg0t4/hello_there_does_anyone_know_which_birds_are/), submitted on 2019-03-10 22:14:24+08:00.

----- __725.1__ -----2019-03-10 22:39:18+08:00:

They shaped the birds to build the Chinese character "fortune" (福) here 

So I don't think it can be speculated based on the shape 

----- __725.2__ -----2019-03-10 23:11:30+08:00:

Crane is a good guess. Considering the long peck in the pic and the important role of crane in Chinese culture

### 729: [Top Chinese officials plagiarised university theses](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/azas5q/top_chinese_officials_plagiarised_university/), submitted on 2019-03-10 09:45:53+08:00.

----- __729.1__ -----2019-03-10 12:37:55+08:00:

One reason is that  the high ranked leaders know that they will pass it w/o any doubt, while the students face the risk of losing their degrees.

----- __729.2__ -----2019-03-10 12:42:11+08:00:

Here is [Xi's PhD paper](https://qiwen.lu/uploads/xilunwen.pdf) if you are interested.

The title and abstract are in English.

Edit: I'm not sure about the case of Xi, but Jiang and Hu 's STEM PhD papers should be real because they are not the ones from red families and were accepted formally by the uni.

----- __729.3__ -----2019-03-10 13:15:36+08:00:

I would upvote you if that's a satire and downvote you if you truely believe it.

----- __729.4__ -----2019-03-10 14:31:25+08:00:

The most funny thing is that, he wanted to cover a huge field, something likes *The development of Politics, Economics, Culture, and Society in Chinese Socialism* (roughly) and his advisor prevented him from doing it.

Again, I don't know how good his paper is since I didn't read it carefully. But technically speaking, for a governer of a province, he may has read lots of materials in this field and has first hand information to finish his paper.

----- __729.5__ -----2019-03-10 14:38:24+08:00:

Harvard Graduate is not that hard tho. (comparatively)

----- __729.6__ -----2019-03-10 14:55:25+08:00:

Yes, market promotion is a key here.

Curious, are they Chinese or non-chinese from Harvard?

To be fair, lots of students even from Harvard are end in average middle class in the long term, including midlife crisis, it's not that special.

----- __729.7__ -----2019-03-11 00:32:01+08:00:

Every paper written in Chinese will provide an English abstract for international communication, so as my undergraduate thesis. For example, if you go to search the papers, you can at least know whether this paper is helpful to your field.

----- __736.3__ -----2019-03-10 13:57:12+08:00:

It makes sense. But I personally use all of them (Xiecheng, Quna'er, Booking, Google etc.) no matter I am in China or the states though all of them cover the major global areas. You may find the different information on both Apps and comments, especially if you go to the unusual-for-foreigner parts and sometimes the price may be different too (coupons, promotion, cooperation, etc).

----- __740.1__ -----2019-03-10 22:06:01+08:00:

TCM is really common in Chinese life, lots of us prefer TCM in some cases such as skin problems. When I was a boy, I had TCM for fever cure.

I don't buy the conspiracy and negative comments here. Simple. Just ask the doctor give you western medicine next time.

关键是这种行动都是绕过司法系统的，就每人弄张分数表，出国扣个分，种族扣个分，名字伊斯兰扣个分，扣没了就不经司法程序抓进去camp。我真是excuse me？

这几年新疆态势的确是较严重，前几年因为维吾尔语课本上的内容被拉到疆独那方面，维吾尔语被大幅压制。

新疆上任zcx柔性治疆被证明失败后，cqg就下军令状把西藏那边的政策弄个加强版过来铁腕治疆。但先不说这种政策的成本和后果如何？就一项不经司法程序抓这么多人，就很无语。这样中国何时才能实现法治？

不要说因为形势的严峻，从长远而言，司法意识是更为重要的。每次都绕开司法程序，就像服用慢性毒品，每次用每次爽，直到最后一命欢呼。

----- __752.2__ -----2019-03-07 10:01:25+08:00:

其实我跟少民青年（非维吾尔）聊过，真挺惨的。注：精英分子那种，不是路边混混。

你想想，出身是没得选的，本来在中国非汉长相的少民就比较难混，日常生活坐个火车住个酒店都经常不行，每次都被人安检。

小时候学校被人歧视，长大了职场歧视也多，相比而言华人在西方所谓天花板已经很好了。身边亲戚八十多岁被抓去一年多现在无声无响，都不知道是不是已经那啥了。

说句罪过点的话，我以前也很支持“铁腕治疆”，但跟人聊过后对我改观很大，让我真正意识到中国人这个身份的含义。

新疆嘛，就去穆斯林极端化这点我是认同的，不过讲道理，新疆更多是跟中亚而非中东相近，也没有太极端。其他政策嘛，我个人持保留意见。

毛一生都推崇“运动”“革命”“人民”，成也革命，败也革命。

他以革命手段赢得内战和促成建国初期的经济建设，但在后来全国需要较为平和的坏境下搞建设，毛这一套就不管用了，所以之后有[大跃进](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E5%A4%A7%E8%B7%83%E8%BF%9B)。

大跃进后毛在党的威信直滑下降，刘毛威信在党内和民间都并驾齐驱，[7000人大会](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh/%E4%B8%83%E5%8D%83%E4%BA%BA%E5%A4%A7%E4%BC%9A)是刘毛矛盾白热化的阶段。到后面毛开始发动[四清运动](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh/%E5%9B%9B%E6%B8%85%E8%BF%90%E5%8A%A8)，此为文革的热身和模拟，到之后[文革](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E5%A4%A7%E9%9D%A9%E5%91%BD)正式斗倒刘少奇。

需要注意的是，一个人为国献身的无私跟权力上瘾的自私是并不矛盾的。毛有伟大的一面，但也有恶劣的一面。另外，毛在经济建设这块的知识的确欠缺，他用功的地方更多是在政治革命这一块。

----- __772.2__ -----2019-03-07 07:02:34+08:00:

No. Mainland China is a term to distinguish CCP-direct-leading part with other parts, such as Hong Kong and Macau SAR, **may or may not include Taiwan**. That's why it's a buffer term because it can be accepted by both sides. Please know that both pro-independence and pro-unification are political claims.

Edit: while Greater China is a term that always contains mainland China, HK, MC, and frequently includes Taiwan, and sometimes includes Singapore.

>	国际间法治就是国际政治和争端的延续

从来都没有国际法治这一称呼，人类还没到那级别。我也没谈及这块。国家间的引渡协定是双边合约而已。

>	美国法

美国等西方世界是三权分立的国家。我不是说在西方的话司法界就没有政治影响，但司法独立和权力制衡还是有的。拿孟晚舟的事件说，美国起诉孟肯定有政治原因，但从经过加拿大法院判决引渡，到美国法院判决定罪，这是一个漫长的过程，而且整个过程是独立进行的。你问我有没有政治施压？我不敢说肯定没有，但法官是可以按照自己对法律的坚守判决的。中国这次，对一例加拿大毒贩的死刑判决，仅仅20天，有点太过了。

退一步说，即使大家肯定了政治干预，但像楼主(OP)宣传通过人质换人质，可以说是很没有法律常识的宣称。这种声音，除了加坏西方普通民众对华观感外，没有任何的作用。同样地，中国这次外交我觉得也有点过头。

下面有人竟然用“奥巴马吸大麻怎么不见中国抓他”来等同于孟晚舟案，可见即不了解事件过程也不了解法律流程(Source: [起诉孟晚舟原件](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bannedbook.org/bnews/baitai/20181209/1044220.html/amp))。

>	国际之间的法律问题就是国际政治的延续。而且，美国控诉的是违法美国自己的法律，我中国法律又不是这么写的。

>	我觉得通过论坛来了解西方人的想法是biased。毕竟键盘侠是键盘侠的想法，美国的政策制定人是政策制定人的想法，他们的想法更为重要，他们有渠道有能力来获取正确的信息做正确的判断，绝大部分美国人也不会跑到Reddit来了解中国表达对中国的看法。还有你可能不知道，美帝许许多多好大学的phd项目，各个金融科技公司有大量的中国人，他们才是价值想法之类民间交流的桥梁，而不是论坛键盘侠。

两者并不是对立的，有些真话别人不会当面对你直白讲。我说的看是指看美国人间的讨论，从而看他们的三观和思维，而不是跟中国或西方的键盘侠辩论。

中国十二年来“百年耻辱”等的教育，造成国人相对地只用中西二元对立的民族叙事来看待问题。西方的话，即有民族主义叙事，但更有自由主义叙事。当年Clinton让中国入WTO也是有这方面的考虑，而非单纯地地缘政治的考虑。说起来太长了，我只是希望中国不要干了几十年最后又是一场洋务运动。

我不是天真地说美国会老老实实地让全部权力出来, 但是中西一直都是友敌(frenemy)的关系, 部分国人一味地受到"百年耻辱"的灌输, 只看到中西文明竞争的一面, 看不到中西可能的合作. 只执着于100年前殖民主义的怨念, 而看不到欧美近几十年在意识形态上的转变.

我很明确地跟你讲, 美欧起码偏liberalism那一派对中国的国家本身本来就没有什么敌意, 主要的分歧还是在意识形态上. 当然我也没有说tg就怎么完全不好, 只是希望给你反映个事实, 看问题要辩证地看待.

I don't think the think tanks in the pentagon will agree with you in some aspects 

But PLA indeed lacks experience, not like the war machine the US, yeah

China model is good at catch up but may not be that efficient when it beomes a global leader or innovater. May work in hardpower but definitely not in softpower. 

Some of the things you list here, such as space exploration and OBOR, are not contradicred to my statement.

----- __789.7__ -----2019-03-05 02:10:31+08:00:

Where is your logic??? Chinese students study in the west because the west is still leading everything, vice versa.

Did you say post? Also, it's better that you answer my question first? It seems that you have a various background which is interesting to me too.

r/saraba1st is a sub for zealous anti-china oversea Chinese. I think their opinions are always biased but you can check. I asked what happen to current Chinese primier Li Keqiang because he lost lots of power as the rise of xi. Chinese movie, you can go to r/ChineseLanguage and search

写得很好，西方很多年轻人都是温室里的花朵。虽然我觉得中国现在还没到那个阶段就开始强烈批判白左有种诡异感。但白左们那种救世主但又肤浅的举动，的确是一种高高在上的姿态，是一种深层次的对他人歧视。

我觉得一个社会，回归到基本的生产和规则总是好的，评判他人也应该以法律和常识为基础。

任何脱离了地面的价值，不管其内涵曾经多么崇高，到最后总是会走回虚伪，成为被人利用谋取私利的工具。

西方中世纪的基督，中国古代的儒家，曾经的共产主义，现在的浮夸白左，到最后都走向迂腐和灭亡。

我没否认你这句话（第二句），是你自己“拿着锤子看什么都是钉子”，连 r/China 里面那些不鸟中国的expat都downvote你，连这个sub里其他人的话你都能过度解读，你这种皈依者狂热症也是够了

我说的“白左”明明是那种WSJ，“中世纪基督徒”明明是打着贵教旗号实作娈童恋权的玩意

我真的很好奇你的背景，一方面你在神学和历史上的知识的确很深，另一方面却表现得不太实际，跟你貌似的“读过很多书”不符合

尽管我有很多观点还是不认同你，但首先感谢你写那么长的分析。我过几周忙完后回来跟你继续讨论这个问题。因为长辩论很费时间。

你算是我遇到过的最另类的人，很有趣，值得好好探讨。

Nah man, we call it 胡椒博士

One way to know the official translation is to search it in English Wikipedia and switch to Chinese version, vice versa.

pepper can be 胡椒 or sth else. It really depends. But it seems that there is no one in China use 椒 lonely.
