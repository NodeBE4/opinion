### 320: [COVID-19 Tied to Progression of Chronic Liver Disease](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/vn6ylg/covid19_tied_to_progression_of_chronic_liver/), submitted on 2022-06-29 12:29:51+08:00.

As past experience demonstrates, most here do not know how to read medical journals.  Fewer know how to recognize a scientific publication.  Nevertheless, I am undeterred.  And I don't see this particular issue mentioned much, but it's something to pay attention to.  

You may be surprised to learn, but it turns out your liver is pretty important.  

Bottom line: About one in five patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) developed progressive cholestasis after severe COVID-19, according to this study. 

COVID-19 related liver injury was more common among patients with CLD. Following severe COVID-19, CLD patients showed progressive cholestasis with persistently increasing levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. 23.1 percent developed cholestatic liver failure --- cholestasis plus bilirubin ≥6 mg/dL --- during infection, and 15.4 percent of patients with CLD developed secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC), which was significantly more frequent with CLD and COVID-19 versus CLD patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients with metabolic risk factors accounted for most COVID-19-associated SSC. 26.3 percent of advanced CLD patients experienced hepatic decompensation following COVID-19.
