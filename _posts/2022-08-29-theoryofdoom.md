### 366: [Are chiropractors psuedoscience? Or are they one of few serious ways to get pain relief.](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/x0kvgl/are_chiropractors_psuedoscience_or_are_they_one/), submitted on 2022-08-29 18:02:25+08:00.

Finding a good chiropractor is hard, but it is not pseudoscience.

### 367: [What are your thoughts on the sudden availability of AIs that generate images from text descriptions?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/x12es0/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_sudden_availability/), submitted on 2022-08-30 06:50:57+08:00.

When I got off DALL-E 2's waitlist, it was a happy day.  

AI-based applications that translate natural language into a visual image are controversial.  But the controversy is misplaced.  Visual art and those who create it are not being replaced with AI.  Rather, the universe of extant human artistic creation and is reimagined anew.

While art that is visual is, certainly, an aesthetic experience (Dewy); it is also so much more than that.  Art is a kind of representation that is purposive in itself and, though without an end, nevertheless promotes the cultivation of the mental powers for sociable communication.  A work of art presents an idea that is would be otherwise inaccessible, so that it might be understood by those who could not see it otherwise (Schopenhauer).  Its creation is an activity requiring creativity (what Kant called innate mental aptitude, through which nature gives the rule to art that take shape) which manifests, in highest form, as a sensory and perceptual representation of truth at the level of the metaphysical (Hegel) and/or beauty that approximates the sublime (C.S. Lewis).  AI cannot do these things, and will never be able to do them.   

As to the risk that an artist's style will be pawned off by one of these applications, I think that risk is overstated.  If any artist has a body of work sufficient to train the AI in a way that recognizes an identifiable style, replication of the style is not infringement.  Or to the extent it is, it is no more an act of infringement than an undergraduate's cubist painting infringes the style of Picasso.

### 368: [A guide of 30 methods for finance, explained in 10 seconds or less (i.e., why math is useful)](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/x19c4b/a_guide_of_30_methods_for_finance_explained_in_10/), submitted on 2022-08-30 12:13:29+08:00.

I'd be willing to bet there's some kid out there staying up late to finish homework wondering why it matters.  This OP is one of the reasons why.

If you can do basic math, you can learn the methods underlying the industry of finance.  If you're good, you might even be able to push the ball forward.  Take the hardest classes you can.  Give them everything you have.  And go make a killing.  Whether in tradfi, defi, fintech or whatever.

----- __368.2__ -----2022-08-30 12:40:09+08:00:

Are you an undergrad?  What's your major now?  Premed?  Bio? 
 Chem?  Biochem?

----- __368.3__ -----2022-08-30 12:46:13+08:00:

I don't know what you learn as a global health major, but seems like it's public health focused to at least some extent.  

Do you want to go to med school?

----- __368.4__ -----2022-08-31 13:03:00+08:00:

It's surprisingly easy to make money in finance if you know what you're doing.  You might want to be careful with exchange traded derivatives and you should probably avoid any OTC derivatives transaction, but stocks or other basic securities you might be able to have some fun with.  Just don't be *that* guy who Robin Hood is sending letters to after you discover options.

### 369: [Admins, please don't call it a mod "summit". It's not a summit, it's a "show"](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/x1wl46/admins_please_dont_call_it_a_mod_summit_its_not_a/), submitted on 2022-08-31 06:31:27+08:00.

I am reminded of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryNxl-lpOME&ab_channel=TBS) for some reason.

### 370: [How is Kate Bush's hit from 1985, "Running Up That Hill" in the Billboard Top 100 right now?](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/x55gav/how_is_kate_bushs_hit_from_1985_running_up_that/), submitted on 2022-09-04 05:33:43+08:00.

----- __370.1__ -----2022-09-04 05:43:16+08:00:

Lol that would explain it . . . I know of Stranger Things, but I haven't watched it.  Last thing on Netflix I watched was the documentary on John MacAfee. 

Other than that, I mostly spend my time on HBO Max . . . rewatching Euphoria . . . getting high on the weekends tbh.

----- __370.2__ -----2022-09-04 05:43:38+08:00:

lol I am so out of the loop

WHAT?  The [motherland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs&ab_channel=rascrifice) has fallen?  

JFK was decades ago.  Everyone knows that lol
