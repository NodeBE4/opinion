At last week's World Internet Conference, China promoted its own vision of global cyberspace, and moved to make WIC an int'l organization. Our coverage of the event is here: <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/14/taking-chinas-global-cyber-body-to-task/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/14/taking-chinas-global-cyber-body-to-task/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FX79awmaMAA8Z7h?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re We also took a look at what China actually means when it talks about "digital literacy." Hint: it's all tied up in a messy knot with the glories of CCP rule and the need for all to fall in line. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FX79wfrakAAwSbk?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Announcing a 2-month action to clean up content on social media and streaming services, China says the goal is to protect youth. But statements earlier this year point to one clear purpose -- paving the way for the CCP's 20th National Congress. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/19/clear-and-bright-for-the-ccp-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/19/clear-and-bright-for-the-ccp-congress/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYAfynHaUAAWdxA?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Our latest in a series of reports on internet controls. See our analysis last week of the World Internet Conference, which is now becoming an international organization (that should be closely watched). <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/14/taking-chinas-global-cyber-body-to-task/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/14/taking-chinas-global-cyber-body-to-task/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYAgh_OakAEEnZQ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re And our look at how "digital literacy" is routinely hijacked in China to serve the immediate political goals of the CCP over real concerns about the safety of youth and others online. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/13/hijacking-digital-literacy/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYAg1bcakAAPHho?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Interesting piece by Oiwan Law about how the cloud-based Chinese platform WPS Office apparently denied a client's access to their own files when one of these was deemed sensitive. <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2022/07/18/a-chinese-office-platform-confirms-that-users-files-on-its-cloud-server-are-subject-to-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://globalvoices.org/2022/07/18/a-chinese-office-platform-confirms-that-users-files-on-its-cloud-server-are-subject-to-censorship/</a>

Re On censorship triggered as soon as files are uploaded from local to cloud server: "If users cannot co-edit a document with their colleagues and are required to download the document to their own machine after editing, there is no point in having a cloud drive."
