Announcing a 2-month action to clean up content on social media and streaming services, China says the goal is to protect youth. But statements earlier this year point to one clear purpose -- paving the way for the CCP's 20th National Congress.‚ÄÇ<a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/19/clear-and-bright-for-the-ccp-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/07/19/clear-and-bright-for-the-ccp-congress/</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYAfynHaUAAWdxA?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
