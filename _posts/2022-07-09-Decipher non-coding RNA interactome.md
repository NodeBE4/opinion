The molecular mechanisms in which lncRNAs regulate biological functions rely on their interaction between DNA and proteins. To uncover lncRNA interactome, we develop comprehensive approaches such as iDRiP-MS and CHIRT-seq to systematically identify lncRNA interacting proteins and the associated chromatin in vivo.  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are able to cooperate with protein complexes to modulate epigenetic regulation, phase separation, compartment formation, and chromatin loop formation. An RNA strand also can invade into double-stranded DNA to form RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) and contributes genomic instability. We use the telomeric transcript, TERRA, as a model, and reveal a large network of TERRA interacting proteins in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells and human cancer cells. TERRA acts as a decoy for a chromatin remodeler, ATRX, and regulates gene expression. TERRA also regulates telomerase activity and telomere integrity in mES cells. In absence of ATRX, TERRA forms DNA:RNA hybridizes to induce DNA damage response at telomeres to facilitate telomere lengthening in human cancer cells that utilize alternative lengthening of telomeres in a telomerase independent manner. By identifying lncRNA interactome, we provide evidence showing TERRA can act in trans and in cis to orchestrate cellular processes through its interactions with proteins and chromatin.►►臺大演講網Website: http://speech.ntu.edu.twFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ntuspeech
