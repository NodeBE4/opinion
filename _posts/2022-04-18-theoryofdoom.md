### 225: [Flaggschiff der Russisches Schwarzmeerflotte "Moskwa" ist Gesunken (English - Russian Flagship of the Black Sea "Moskva" Has Sunk)](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/u6c8jc/flaggschiff_der_russisches_schwarzmeerflotte/), submitted on 2022-04-18 20:42:05+08:00.

Submission Statement: Several days ago, the Moskva sank.  This ship was the flagship vessel of Russia's Black Sea naval fleet.  According to the Kremlin, this loss was due to "fire caused by the detonation of ammunition."  According to Ukrainian sources, that fire was caused by one or more anti-ship torpedoes, at least partially in response to the confrontation between a Russian warship and the Ukrainian military on [Snake Island](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgm3mk/ukraine-russian-warship-go-fuck-yourself).  Loss of the Moskva is the most significant Russian naval loss since WWII.  Military experts suggest this may cause the Kremlin to reevaluate its strategy in the Black Sea and Ukraine, more generally.

Two factors may be in play there, at least.  Change in protocol in addition to less acute symptom onset.

In this subreddit, we allow diverse political viewpoints to be expressed so long as they're within the bounds of reason --- which includes disagreeing with the significance of present trends.  It is when those disagreements shift in scope from questions over the significance of trends, or purported trends, to partisan characterizations of anyone who disagrees with you that those discussions become a problem.  Make no mistake on this point, either: both "sides" give as good as they get and neither is more guilty of promulgating misinformation than the other --- a concept many truly struggle to comprehend.
