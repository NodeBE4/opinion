### 225: [Flaggschiff der Russisches Schwarzmeerflotte "Moskwa" ist Gesunken (English - Russian Flagship of the Black Sea "Moskva" Has Sunk)](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/u6c8jc/flaggschiff_der_russisches_schwarzmeerflotte/), submitted on 2022-04-18 20:42:05+08:00.

Submission Statement: Several days ago, the Moskva sank.  This ship was the flagship vessel of Russia's Black Sea naval fleet.  According to the Kremlin, this loss was due to "fire caused by the detonation of ammunition."  According to Ukrainian sources, that fire was caused by one or more anti-ship torpedoes, at least partially in response to the confrontation between a Russian warship and the Ukrainian military on [Snake Island](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgm3mk/ukraine-russian-warship-go-fuck-yourself).  Loss of the Moskva is the most significant Russian naval loss since WWII.  Military experts suggest this may cause the Kremlin to reevaluate its strategy in the Black Sea and Ukraine, more generally.

> Vent numbers have been weird lately.

Two factors may be in play there, at least.  Change in protocol in addition to less acute symptom onset.

In this subreddit, we allow diverse political viewpoints to be expressed so long as they're within the bounds of reason --- which includes disagreeing with the significance of present trends.  It is when those disagreements shift in scope from questions over the significance of trends, or purported trends, to partisan characterizations of anyone who disagrees with you that those discussions become a problem.  Make no mistake on this point, either: both "sides" give as good as they get and neither is more guilty of promulgating misinformation than the other --- a concept many truly struggle to comprehend.

### 227: [Two teenage boys die in their sleep days after their second Pfizer injection. Epidemiologist confirms the injections were fatal and caused the death. Peer reviewed study by College of American Pathologists also confirm the injections killed these two boys.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/u6niq1/two_teenage_boys_die_in_their_sleep_days_after/), submitted on 2022-04-19 05:04:05+08:00.

The reporting here is questionable, but if you'd linked [the study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35157759/) it may have been allowed.

### 228: [CDC mask mandate for travelers no longer in effect following judge's ruling, official says](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/u6q7sb/cdc_mask_mandate_for_travelers_no_longer_in/), submitted on 2022-04-19 07:06:43+08:00.

> It's fucking stupid . . . . 

Sure.  Everyone who disagrees with you is a right wing conspiracy theorist and [also literally Hitler](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/189/715/161.jpg).  Now that we have that out of the way, why not try to say something constructive?

----- __228.2__ -----2022-04-19 13:34:31+08:00:

This is so all so transparently political.  Biden admin extended the airline mandate because they knew this ruling was coming down, and I'm sure had four clerks monitoring the docket to see when the opinion issued.  When it did, they immediately pivoted to blame a Republican judge just like Pritzker did when his mandates were struck.  Which is what was wanted all along.  And now here we are. 

This is so exhaustingly stupid.

> There's a non-zero chance he wanted this. 

Understatement of the century.

----- __228.4__ -----2022-04-19 13:38:01+08:00:

It's a federal development.  Local and state mandates may still apply, but that's uncertain.  For example, the only reason the CTA mandated masks was because of the federal mandate.  With the federal mandate gone, CTA might drop theirs too.  But they might not.  Only the (political) science will tell.

There is no point in bothering with evidence, when you have faith.  And this is an argument that is taking place at the religious level for many.  You cannot reason someone out of something he or she was not reasoned into.
