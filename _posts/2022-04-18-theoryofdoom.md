Submission Statement: Locked Shields is an annual cyber wargames exercise, this year held in Tallinn, Estonia.  While hosted by NATO countries, Ukrainians will join the team of more than 30 representatives from NATO-related organizations and member countries.  This year, exercises will focus on interdependencies between national IT systems.

Submission Statement: Several days ago, the Moskva sank.  This ship was the flagship vessel of Russia's Black Sea naval fleet.  According to the Kremlin, this loss was due to "fire caused by the detonation of ammunition."  According to Ukrainian sources, that fire was caused by one or more anti-ship torpedoes, at least partially in response to the confrontation between a Russian warship and the Ukrainian military on [Snake Island](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgm3mk/ukraine-russian-warship-go-fuck-yourself).  Loss of the Moskva is the most significant Russian naval loss since WWII.  Military experts suggest this may cause the Kremlin to reevaluate its strategy in the Black Sea and Ukraine, more generally.

Two factors may be in play there, at least.  Change in protocol in addition to less acute symptom onset.

In this subreddit, we allow diverse political viewpoints to be expressed so long as they're within the bounds of reason --- which includes disagreeing with the significance of present trends.  It is when those disagreements shift in scope from questions over the significance of trends, or purported trends, to partisan characterizations of anyone who disagrees with you that those discussions become a problem.  Make no mistake on this point, either: both "sides" give as good as they get and neither is more guilty of promulgating misinformation than the other --- a concept many truly struggle to comprehend.

Peer reviewed study by College of American Pathologists also confirm the injections killed these two boys.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/u6niq1/two_teenage_boys_die_in_their_sleep_days_after/), submitted on 2022-04-19 05:04:05+08:00.

The reporting here is questionable, but if you'd linked [the study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35157759/) it may have been allowed.

### 228: [CDC mask mandate for travelers no longer in effect following judge's ruling, official says](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/u6q7sb/cdc_mask_mandate_for_travelers_no_longer_in/), submitted on 2022-04-19 07:06:43+08:00.

----- __228.1__ -----2022-04-19 13:27:57+08:00:

> It's fucking stupid . . . . 

Sure.  Everyone who disagrees with you is a right wing conspiracy theorist and [also literally Hitler](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/189/715/161.jpg).  Now that we have that out of the way, why not try to say something constructive?

----- __228.2__ -----2022-04-19 13:34:31+08:00:

This is so all so transparently political.  Biden admin extended the airline mandate because they knew this ruling was coming down, and I'm sure had four clerks monitoring the docket to see when the opinion issued.  When it did, they immediately pivoted to blame a Republican judge just like Pritzker did when his mandates were struck.  Which is what was wanted all along.  And now here we are. 

This is so exhaustingly stupid.

----- __228.3__ -----2022-04-19 13:35:20+08:00:

> There's a non-zero chance he wanted this. 

Understatement of the century.

----- __228.4__ -----2022-04-19 13:38:01+08:00:

It's a federal development.  Local and state mandates may still apply, but that's uncertain.  For example, the only reason the CTA mandated masks was because of the federal mandate.  With the federal mandate gone, CTA might drop theirs too.  But they might not.  Only the (political) science will tell.

----- __228.5__ -----2022-04-19 13:40:10+08:00:

There is no point in bothering with evidence, when you have faith.  And this is an argument that is taking place at the religious level for many.  You cannot reason someone out of something he or she was not reasoned into.

----- __228.6__ -----2022-04-19 13:52:06+08:00:

> I am kind of surprised it was extended it by two weeks to only be struck down by a judge, you would think they could have seen that coming? 

Of course they saw it coming.  That was the point, as reflected in this sequence of events' conformity with prior unfoldings at both the state and federal levels.

Here's the pattern:

* Step 1 - Extend mandate indefinitely, decouple from any purported "metric." 
* Step 2 - Face lawsuit, in view of overreach and abuse of power based on "safety" and "public health."  
* Step 3 - Make lots of noise about how your political rivals are threatening safety and public health by filing lawsuit.
* Step 4 - Lose lawsuit, while blaming opposing party for all harm that follows after.

Wisconsin.  Colorado.  Illinois.  Etc. 

Federal Vaccine Mandate Round 1.  Federal Vaccine Mandate Round 2.  Federal mask mandate on travel.  Etc.

Who is to blame?  Republicans.

Who is not to blame?  Democrats.

Why?  Republicans filed lawsuits to end the overreach.

It is really that simple. 

I think this is an absurd strategy.  But it's clearly the strategy because like everyone is doing it.

----- __228.7__ -----2022-04-19 19:56:19+08:00:

I'm being downvoted because there is a very large group of people who cannot come to terms with the reality of what these mandates have become.

----- __228.8__ -----2022-04-19 20:54:07+08:00:

> but unscientific, well, that's not correct.

You are mistaken.  

* [Cochrane Review](https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses) finds that "[c]ompared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people)," based on nine published studies comprising "[s]even studies [which] took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers." They further concluded "[c]ompared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people)." 
* [Guerra 2021](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.21257385v1.full) concludes "[m]ask mandates and use are not associated with slower state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges."
* [Xiao 2020](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article) found that "evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission." 
* [Klompas 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372) explained that "[w]hat is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown. A mask alone will not prevent health care workers with early Covid-19 from contaminating their hands and spreading the virus to patients and colleagues. Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures." 
* [Jefferson 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2) reports that "[c]ompared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for influenza (Risk Ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.43)."
* [Radonovich 2019](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214#227119846) helpfully illustrates the state of the state of the art before everyone in the alleged field of public health turned off their brain, in investigating the question of whether use of N95 respirators or medical masks more effective in preventing influenza infection among outpatient health care personnel in close contact with patients with suspected respiratory illness.  Of course, the data from "this pragmatic, cluster randomized clinical trial involving 2862 health care personnel" indicated "no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza among health care personnel with the use of N95 respirators (8.2%) vs medical masks (7.2%)."  And as exemplified by, for example, [Smith 2016](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567), that was to be expected.  

There is not now, nor has there ever been, scientific evidence of any kind supporting the propositions that: (a) mask use reduces COVID transmission or the wearer's susceptibility to infection (whether by COVID or any other coronavirus); and (b) mandated mask use reduces community spread of either COVID or any such respiratory virus.

There's a cognitive dissonance aspect of it, yes.  But it's also that I speak from an informed position on these issues.  So, instead of actually talking about the state of the scientific research or any particular findings, a large cohort will just downvote to express their disagreement with what I have said, based solely on what they think they understand, to the extent they can't speak intelligently on these issues.

----- __228.10__ -----2022-04-20 08:47:15+08:00:

Here's the bottom line.  People were told by "experts" to do something, which was inconvenient to them.  The "experts" told them the inconvenience was justified, for the greater good.  People bore those sacrifices, through months of fogged glasses and frustrated conversations.

Then they see what I've said, and react with a "WTF is this guy even talking about?!?!?!?!"  Understandably so, because they've been told the same thing for so long.  

But what matters is what is true.  Truth matters more than ideology or politics, and the truth is what the data say.  Period.

### 229: [TSA will no longer enforce mask mandate after a federal judge strikes it down](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/u6t58f/tsa_will_no_longer_enforce_mask_mandate_after_a/), submitted on 2022-04-19 09:28:21+08:00.

----- __229.1__ -----2022-04-19 19:58:52+08:00:

Maybe if we ever get a libertarian elected, we can roll back all of the war on terror's imperious overreach.  Wouldn't it be nice . . . .

### 230: [Masks Still Required on CTA After Federal Judge Strikes Down CDC Mandate](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/u7a01e/masks_still_required_on_cta_after_federal_judge/), submitted on 2022-04-20 01:04:20+08:00.

----- __230.1__ -----2022-04-20 08:18:41+08:00:

There's a lot of uncertainty over what is required.  Let's not risk giving incorrect advice, because people are still sorting this out.  For example, some airlines might still be requiring masks but others might not.
