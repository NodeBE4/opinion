Very honored to meet the Nobel Peace Prize laureate @mariaressa and present her with my book.<br>What I did not expect was that she had indeed read about it. So now she has two “freedom.”<br>Thanks for what you have done to defend press freedom and access to facts and truths.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ff-hxqAVQAEgXJb?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
