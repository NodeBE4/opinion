     ECONOMICS publishing has recently undergone a great democratisation. High-quality academic writing was once confined to a handful of journals, mostly accessible in academic libraries. The journals still exist, but mostly serve to influence university hiring decisions.

But the upshot, for the moment at least, is that most readers will turn elsewhere for their economic history. That’s capitalism for you.
