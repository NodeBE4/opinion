\[SS from the article by Alex De Waal, Executive Director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School, Tufts University.\]

"Coming just two years after Sudan’s historic democratic transition, the October 25 coup by the Sudanese army has halted the country’s faltering steps toward stability. In the weeks since seizing control of the government, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces, has dissolved civilian institutions and kept deposed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and other leading politicians under detention. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Sudanese have courageously taken to the streets in protest and staged a general strike amid food shortages and rampant inflation... 

As a direct snub to the United States, Burhan’s power grab has further called into question U.S. influence in an already unstable neighborhood. Burhan was likely emboldened by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s repudiation of U.S. efforts to end the war and humanitarian crisis in that country. Now, the general threatens to undo yet another fledgling democratic government that had been supported by the United States, to the not-so-secret satisfaction of Russia, China, and would-be autocrats around the world.

Such an outcome, however, is hardly predetermined. In contrast to other fragile aspiring democracies across the greater Middle East in recent years, Sudan maintains a strong diplomatic relationship with the United States. Crucial to Washington’s leverage is whether key allies in the region—Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—are onboard. Whether the Biden administration is prepared to take rapid action to restore Sudan’s democratic transition will be a crucial test of its ability to shape political outcomes in the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea arena and of Biden’s increasingly vulnerable democracy agenda worldwide."
