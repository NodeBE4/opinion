### 1142: [Scientology has a number of “secret doctrines,” including ones related to the alien king Xenu. What is the significance of these doctrines?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11ptb1u/scientology_has_a_number_of_secret_doctrines/), submitted on 2023-03-13 07:22:08+08:00.

Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to r/AskScienceFiction.

If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.

Unfortunately I do not know that there's a general religion ask sub, but if there is then that'd be where to go.

----- __1142.3__ -----2023-03-13 20:47:30+08:00:

Because the question is in the present tense and is implicitly about the present state of the religion. If you'd like to ask about the historical significance of Scientological doctrine, please do so in a way that clearly highlights this.

### 1143: [(China) How exactly did Taiping Rebellion military decentralization lead to the Warlord Era?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11rp5hq/china_how_exactly_did_taiping_rebellion_military/), submitted on 2023-03-15 15:22:39+08:00.

In some ways, this question is ultimately one not of historical causality, but of historiography: *why* have historians made the arguments they have? Because the answer is not immediately straightforward. I would posit that it all stems from citing an assumption as fact.

In 1970, Philip A Kuhn's *Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China: Militarization and Social Structure, 1796-1864* was published, which advanced a bold thesis: the transition from 'traditional' to 'modern' processes in Chinese state and society, and the resultant breakdown of the imperial order, took place not as a result of violent contact with the West after 1839 as commonly asserted, but rather as a result of internal processes that began snowballing from the 1790s onward. Qing mishandling of the White Lotus Rebellion in 1796-1806 led to the formation of local militias, which increasingly consolidated into regional networks. These were further emboldened by Qing failures in the Opium War of 1839-42, and came to be officially co-opted into the Qing war effort on a mass scale during the Taiping War in 1851-64 with the establishment of *Yongying* forces under the command of such men as Zeng Guofan. This, however, was the only part that Kuhn analysed in depth, as suggested by the title of his book. While he *suggested* that the continued decentralisation of Qing military power would lead, eventually, to the warlord period, his actual research focussed squarely on the Jiaqing (1796-1820) and Daoguang (1820-1850) reigns of the Qing, and didn't actually go beyond 1864. But Kuhn's extrapolation then became taken as historically sound by a generation of scholars who simply failed to question whether the proposed trajectory was actually, well, true. 

And one can detect a variety of responses to this in later literature, albeit often implicit. For instance, Edmund S.K. Fung, in *The Military Dimension of the Chinese Revolution* (1980), explicitly argues that the New Army that precipitated the 1911 Revolution emerged out of military overhauls after 1895 which supplanted the old Taiping-era militia forces, many of which had been downsized or disbanded following the end of the Taiping conflict. Edward J.M. Rhoads, in *Manchus and Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1862-1928* (2000), does not tackle warlordism as such, but does point out the rather heterogeneous nature of Qing military reforms, which attempted in the post-1895 period to establish multiethnic imperial corps, pivoting to a much more Han-dominated New Army under the New Policies enacted after 1901. What we end up, with, then, is at least one point of disjuncture – 1895 – separating the divested Taiping-era militias from the more centralised structures that the Qing attempted to impose after the defeat to Japan.

But in neither instance is there an assertion that the warlord armies were direct descendants of the New Army either. Edmund Fung notes that the primary influence of the New Army was in altering the relationship between civil bureaucracy and military leadership, allowing the latter to presume, and therefore assume, greater importance than they had done in the pre-1901 era. But the troops constituting the warlord armies were extremely varied. Some forces, particularly the Anhui and Zhili Cliques, drew heavily, even predominantly, on New Army veterans, whereas other forces were entirely composed of new recruits post-Revolution.

The picture becomes further complicated, however, when we consider that these armies never supplanted each other outright – though not for lack of trying. During the Taiping War, the *Yongying* reorganised militias rubbed shoulders with local militias, Green Standard forces, and Banner soldiers, all of whom continued to exist afterward. The Wuwei Corps established after 1895 was a limited force based at Beijing, and both imperial and regional forces on older models continued to exist. The New Army reforms attempted to do away with these forces and create bifurcated armies consisting of New Army troops as the 'tip of the spear' and 'Patrol and Defence Forces' as a peacetime gendarmerie and wartime reserve, but this was still incomplete by the beginning of 1911. Hubei would not disband the last of its Green Standard forces, which constituted about a fifth of its 40,000 military personnel at the start of the year, until the end of June; many of Hunan's Green Standards, who made up nearly half of its 35,500 troops, were still in service at the time of the revolution on 10 October. Moreover, the Banner units remained largely separate, though the Qing did establish two Manchu-only units: the Imperial Guard and the 1st Division.

So even if you did want to draw a clean genealogy, you don't really get one: the Taiping-era *Yongying* didn't uniformly transform into the New Army, which did not uniformly transition into the warlord armies. Moreover, as suggested earlier, these were not armies of comparable nature. It is easy to overlook that the *Yongying* armies were commanded by civilian officials given temporary extraordinary powers to maintain and command military forces, not by professional career officers as the New Army was. It is true that the heterogeneous army of 1911 ultimately broke apart in no small part thanks to the ability of charismatic individuals to consolidate control over their own portions, but they were originally, at their core, regional armies, maintained at provincial discretion and at provincial expense, albeit along central directives. The rise of charismatic warlords was a bug rather than a feature. By contrast, the *Yongying* forces were fundamentally built around their charismatic leaders, and their regional character was somewhat more coincidental. Li Hongzhang's Huai Army, named for Anhui, spent most of its existence headquartered in Zhili because its commander had gone there; Zeng Guofan's Xiang Army, named for Hunan, ultimately recruited beyond its ostensible core province, even if it never outright shook its provincial reputation. The resemblances between the *Yongying* and the New Army, then, were largely superficial, and as has been said, the warlord armies were not simple successors of a fragmenting New Army.

With that I think it is safe to say that Taiping-era military decentralisation really *didn't* lead to the Warlord Era. We can draw a chronological and causative chain, of course, but it is not one of a linear trajectory. The New Army *replaced* (well, mostly replaced) the Taiping-era militias in response to their failures, and had substantial organisational differences. The warlords did not receive the New Army wholesale, but drew on what troops they could, where they could. Two substantial points of rupture separate the Taiping from the warlords, both representing significant changes in direction.
