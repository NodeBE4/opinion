### 1142: [Scientology has a number of “secret doctrines,” including ones related to the alien king Xenu. What is the significance of these doctrines?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11ptb1u/scientology_has_a_number_of_secret_doctrines/), submitted on 2023-03-13 07:22:08+08:00.

Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to r/AskScienceFiction.

If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.

Unfortunately I do not know that there's a general religion ask sub, but if there is then that'd be where to go.

----- __1142.3__ -----2023-03-13 20:47:30+08:00:

Because the question is in the present tense and is implicitly about the present state of the religion. If you'd like to ask about the historical significance of Scientological doctrine, please do so in a way that clearly highlights this.
