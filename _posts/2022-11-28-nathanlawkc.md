History in the making. We have no idea whether we are in the beginning, middle, or end of it. <br>But we are sure that history will mark what you have done as something magnificent. History will treat you well.<br>No matter what happen, your effort is not going in vain.<br>#白紙革命<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fil7DWaWYAcxaub?format=png&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
