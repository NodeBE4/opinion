1/<br>Quick updates of #Chinaprotest:<br>- Police are stationed in many main protest sites<br>- Protestors started to be arrested by police<br>- Some of the early patches of protestors are released<br>- Citizens continue to pop up at street corners with blank papers

Re 2/<br>Things that are worthwhile looking at:<br>- Attitude of the central govt. News showed that some of the city’s COVID control have been relaxed, but that’s not the whole country. I believe Beijing has not yet decided how to react.

Re 3/<br>- Demands of people. Slogans range from “end COVID lockdown” to “Down with CCP/ Xi.” It would be interesting to see whether there’s a consolidation of what people want<br>- Overseas protests. Tens of overseas protests were organised in the past weekend ....

Re 5/<br>whether the people continue to protest is the key. Colleges are still crucial sites. <br>- Intl support. Many are hesitant because PRC would label any foreign supports as “interference”, then weaken the moral appeal of the protest. How intl NGOs &amp; Orgs &amp; Govts gonna react?

Re 6/<br>What we can do as non-local protestors:<br>- Retweet &amp; spread info. It’s crucial to educate more ppl about what’s happening in China.<br>- Solidarity. Protestors are often in fear and feel alone. They cannot publicly talk about it. Show your solidarity with them to keep them warm.

Re 8/<br>Long days to come. The situation is still varying and decided. We are all observing and assessing. Circulation of information is still challenging. The whole dynamics of China are still like in a black box.<br>But we hang on, and we march on. <br>Persist.<br>/END

Rare scenes of protest in Hong Kong emerged: a group of citizens gathered in Central, the busiest commercial area, and held blank papers. Police arrived and protestors' IDs were marked. It's been a long time since protests are staged in the streets after NSL. <br>Photo: Ming Pao<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiptL3UXEAEyJBS?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiptMh-XwAAz1h5?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FiptQ13WYAAnhMt?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
