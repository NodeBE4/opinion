     The Revival of Ideologies in Contemporary China — An Interdisciplinary Call of ‘Bringing Ideology Back In’
    </br>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   22-23 May 2015
  </p>
  <p>
   The Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre and St. Antony’s College,  University of Oxford
  </p>
  <p>
   Call for Papers – Deadline for Submission: 23 March 2015
  </p>
  <p>
   The ideological landscape in China has flourished as the regime no longer rests its legitimacy on traditional socialist ideology but rather draws on a variety of ideologies as justificatory strategies. Furthermore, the problems caused by the economic reforms have reignited fierce, ideologically-avowed debates in the Party circles. Intellectuals, interest groups, internet users and citizens also have entered the debate. A vibrant and competitive ideological landscape has gradually developed in the public sphere, consisting of neo-leftism, liberalism, constitutionalism, Confucianism, Republicanism, etc. Despite the revival of ideologies, the study of ideology seems to be on the sidelines of mainstream research of contemporary China. It is also replete with methodological and conceptual challenges that are not yet satisfactorily resolved.
  </p>
  <p>
   This conference intends to create a platform for graduate students of humanities, social sciences and area studies to share their views on the study of ideology in contemporary China through their own research. Potential papers may discuss topics such as the origin, development and influence of a particular ideology, the role of ideology in shaping political conflicts and policy debates, and the regime’s ability to influence ideological debates. In addition to the presentations on their specific research questions, participants are encouraged to present how their research tackles the methodological and conceptual challenges in the study of ideology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building on the success of the three previous graduate conferences, this year’s conference aims to provide another opportunity for graduate students of contemporary China to build up academic networks and foster opportunities for future cooperation. The one-day conference will be held on Saturday, 23 May 2015 at Oxford. On the evening of Friday, 22 May, there will be a specially featured roundtable discussion during which prominent China scholars will offer their thoughts on the theme of the conference. All conference participants are invited to the discussion. Speakers in the previous roundtable discussions included Prof. Patricia Thornton, Prof. Rosemary Foot, Prof. Vivienne Shue, Prof. Jeffrey Wasserstrom, etc.
