I feel like AI trained on Twitter comments could do a better job than CNN's "contributors" or content creators, like Brian Steltzer or whatever his name is.

### 91: [A Russian court put a couple from Severodvinsk in prison for 3 years, who tortured the cat Kuzya to death. The sadists not only abused the animal, but posted a video on the social network.

Canada is purporting to do to its citizens what the United States did to Russians who were involved in human rights violations, during the Obama administration.  

Trudeau has lost his mind.

### 94: [‘Not There Yet:' Lightfoot Refuses to Specify Date for Lifting Chicago's Mask Mandate](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/st4mbi/not_there_yet_lightfoot_refuses_to_specify_date/), submitted on 2022-02-15 22:50:20+08:00.

> This has been true for quite a broad spectrum of our public health response, actually. From the very beginning we've always acted like the vaccines don't actually do anything. That's why I call people like this the real anti-vaxxers.

The problem is that Arwady is stupid.  Like actually stupid, meaning that she is intellectually incapable of understanding how such arcane, pedestrian concepts as "cause" and "effect" are reflected in this thing called "data."  She doesn't even likely have the ability to articulate the difference between what is a "case" and what constitutes a "positive test" or by what level of probability the former and latter diverge.  

But that would require minimally adequate knowledge of at least something approximating science.  It's not even clear she could get past the math needed in order to get there.   I seriously question whether she actually has the ability to understand the results of statistical modeling, much less do it, no matter how simple.  

People assume that because she holds a position she is competent and/or capable.  They make this assumption because they are not in a position to distinguish expertise from incompetence.  For example, this is why people go to stupid doctors, suffer incidents of medical malpractice and are none-the-wiser and suffer any number of avoidable pains due to the stupidity of those experts on whom they rely to help them.   

Lori is going to be out.  And with her, so will the rest of this sea of incompetence.  I'm not a fan of Preckwinkle by any measure, but at least I can rely on her to keep the damn lights on.  I miss Rham.

> I think this is what the “eff it, I’m not getting re-elected anyways” plan looks like

I doubt it.  I'd bet Lori's advisors have actually told her the political risks to her are greater if she drops the mandates than if she maintains them.  Not because they know anything about anything --- which they obviously do not.  But because they cannot see the writing on the wall. 

Republican will be elected governor.  I'd expect an executive order prohibiting the imposition of mask mandates in short order.

> Throughout the entire course of the pandemic Lori has made a very clear effort to somehow set herself apart from Pritzker in every decision made when it comes to mandates and restrictions. 

It is actually hilarious how much she has failed in this respect, though.  She wants to be perceived as independent but is so deficient in leadership ability that she winds up just looking like a mindless contrarian.

Most reddit moderators in these subs would have failed a high school advanced placement biology test.  The barometer of truth for them is whatever CNN says it is.  Others do not operate according to that standard, however.

### 97: [[February 15, 2022] Community Update](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/stjy0o/february_15_2022_community_update/), submitted on 2022-02-16 10:00:15+08:00.

Thanks.  On ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and other out of patent compounds, it will take several years for the jury to be settled in the United States on that one.  The verdict will come in, but it likely won't be under the current leadership at NIAID/NIH.  It is regretful that the politics and economics surrounding those medications developed in the way they did.  

On assuming users have knowledge, I tend to give people the chance to wade into the water whether they realize how deep it is or not.  That's because I'd rather see them step up to bat, swing and miss than sit in the dugout or never even show up to the game. 
 Individual users don't bother me on this pont, but I'll be very straightforward when I say that reading some of self-published substacks people have submitted here is like listening to a symphony of alley cats fighting over an empty can of tuna, music playing out of tune, nails on a chalkboard or any other appropriate comparison.  Thankfully few users here have ever conducted themselves in that way.

Don’t know what that is.

> Honestly as a rural NY dweller, I hate when people assume I live in the unbearable shithole that is NYC

Rural upstate NY is beautiful.  I have no use for the city, either.  But if I had to live in a city in that failed state, I'd take Buffalo over NYC most days.  While also a shithole, it's less of a shithole than NYC.  Especially now.

This low-effort noise adds no value whatsoever to the discussion.
