Thanks for the link /u/Dirish. For what it's worth, at this point I personally think [Mia Mulder's video on Tartaria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtU_M0Sjd9Y), which is based on far more research than I've ever done, more than supersedes my old post. The main thing is that Tartaria as it existed even then is not a single narrative so much as a super-narrative that unites three separate conspiracy narratives:

1. The 'Cultural Layer' (i.e. the idea that a global 'mudflood' raised ground level in large parts of the world simultaneously, hence explaining buildings with windows below street level).
2. 'Tartaria' in Early Modern geographies (i.e. failing to recognise the use of 'Tartaria' as a generic regional designate and not as a state entity).
3. Architectural anti-modernism (i.e. declaring any pre-modernist architecture to be essentially stylistically cogent).

My post covers only the second of these but Mulder does all three.
