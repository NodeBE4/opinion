### 1041: [Mindless Monday, 09 January 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/107cogb/mindless_monday_09_january_2023/), submitted on 2023-01-09 20:00:12+08:00.

Thanks for the link /u/Dirish. For what it's worth, at this point I personally think [Mia Mulder's video on Tartaria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtU_M0Sjd9Y), which is based on far more research than I've ever done, more than supersedes my old post. The main thing is that Tartaria as it existed even then is not a single narrative so much as a super-narrative that unites three separate conspiracy narratives:

1. The 'Cultural Layer' (i.e. the idea that a global 'mudflood' raised ground level in large parts of the world simultaneously, hence explaining buildings with windows below street level).
2. 'Tartaria' in Early Modern geographies (i.e. failing to recognise the use of 'Tartaria' as a generic regional designate and not as a state entity).
3. Architectural anti-modernism (i.e. declaring any pre-modernist architecture to be essentially stylistically cogent).

My post covers only the second of these but Mulder does all three.

### 1042: [What is the academically accepted definition of "Chinese people" by historians?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/107v6dj/what_is_the_academically_accepted_definition_of/), submitted on 2023-01-10 08:25:20+08:00.

----- __1042.1__ -----2023-01-10 16:32:16+08:00:

The short answer is there isn't one. The mid-length answer is that the definition is invariably a contextual one. The long answer is below.

To begin with, historians who deal with issues of identity will generally be a lot more precise in their terminology than those who do not, and there are certain subfields of Chinese history where such issues are generally not brought up – even though they could be. This absence is most keenly felt in 20th century history, where, especially post-Qing, most histories will sort of elide the definition of Chinese nationhood – crack open any standard history of the Second Sino-Japanese War like Rana Mitter's *Forgotten Ally* or Hans van de Ven's *China at War*, and you will find near-total silence on the matter of minority groups. Arguably, such works do, by implication, buy into the sorts of supraethnic national definition you describe. Historians of Imperial China may use 'Chinese' quite casually in place of 'Han' when discussing issues that are, in general, relevant specifically to the Han. For instance if someone is talking about 'Chinese religion', you can be pretty sure they only mean Han Chinese practices, not Tibetan or Zhuang or Miao. In both cases, historians are essentially reading 'with the grain' of the contemporary evidence, using definitions of 'Chinese' that are based on generally contemporary understandings. However, there is a difference in that the definition being derived from is not always consistent: 'Chinese' in the imperial context generally is used to translate the cultural label of 'Han', whereas 'Chinese' in a post-imperial context usually is used to translate the *national* label of 'Chinese' as used by the ROC and PRC in their respective periods. And then a separate set of priorities applies for historians of Chinese diasporas, whose subjects were mostly Han and who thus probably do not need to differentiate between peoples who were not Han but still 'Chinese' by some label or another.

None of these uses are unproblematic, and they reflect an underlying issue that there is no word in any Sinitic language that maps directly onto 'Chinese', whose use in English encompasses a variety of ideas. *Zhongguoren* carries an implicit character of nationality, but also more specifically of statehood – i.e. a *Zhongguoren* is one who is identified as being a citizen or subject of a state recognised as being *Zhongguo*. *Huaren* is somewhat ethnic, somewhat cultural, and generally carries the connotation of either just the Han, or the wider group of peoples who follow Han cultural norms. And you also have *Hanren*, a narrower ethnic term specifically denoting Han Chinese. So you could have a situation where a Hui person may be a *Zhongguoren* by political definition, possibly a *Huaren* by genealogical but not by cultural definition, and definitively not a *Hanren* by ethnic definition. On the other hand, a diaspora Han Chinese person would be a *Huaren* and a *Hanren*, but not a *Zhongguoren* unless they specifically affirmed said nationality. Yet all three of these might be used to mean 'Chinese' in a given context: to a political historian 'Chinese' may map most closely onto *Zhongguoren* in the sense of a subject of the state; for a cultural historian 'Chinese' may map mainly onto *Huaren* as a term denoting a broad cultural group; for a historian of identity discourses, 'Chinese' may map mainly onto *Hanren* as a convenient synonym to distinguish them from steppe nomadic peoples, tribal groups in the Southeast Asian uplands, and so on.

While Qing specialists in particular have often advocated a certain greater specificity of language in these matters, standards are not always consistent, and the term 'Chinese' often creeps through. All three of the above ways of using the term can be found in key works on Qing history like Pamela Crossley's *A Translucent Mirror* or Peter Perdue's *China Marches West* – 'Chinese' to mean subjects of a 'Chinese' state, 'Chinese' to refer to those in a particular cultural tradition, and 'Chinese' as synonym for 'Han'. Now, in general, these historians would agree that peoples who are defined as part of a Chinese nation *now* were not Chinese for all time: it makes no sense to speak of 12th century Mongols, 16th century Jurchens, or 18th century Tibetans as 'Chinese' in any meaningful way. But then there ends up being the question of where such peoples fit. If we agree that we cannot impose a 'Chinese' label on societies that were not part of a 'Chinese' empire at the time, then how do we avoid the pitfall of only ever discussing them in the context of 'Chinese' history? We can agree that the Mongols enter the narrative of Chinese history after their attacks on Western Xia began on 1205, but what about beforehand? How should we discuss the pre-Qing history of what we *now* call Manchuria, especially when 'Manchuria' itself is an 18th century neologism, significantly postdating the formation of the Qing empire? In other words, how can we avoid replacing one Sinocentric narrative (that of the modern Chinese nation back-projected through time) with another (in which 'China' is acknowledged as historically contingent, but nevertheless the central object of consideration)?

One approach is that of Evelyn Rawski, rooted in the approaches pioneered by global history, which is to think about the wider East Asian region in terms of interconnectivity and simultaneity rather than purely in terms of proto-national narratives. At the extreme end, this could mean discarding the very notion of 'Chinese history' altogether in favour of a more broadly 'Asian' history in which statehood and the boundaries imposed by states are acknowledged, but not allowed to posthumously impose those same limits on historical study. This doesn't fix the problem of defining 'Chineseness' however: variation and contrast are just as important as commonality here, and it is still important to speak of distinctions between, say, 'Chinese', 'Korean, and 'Japanese' contexts within an '(East) Asian' whole. We could take some cues from Dominic Lieven, who, drawing on work by Peter Perdue, offers an alternative definition of 'China' itself, as really being a collective term for a shifting series of states claiming common political traditions and genealogies of statehood. 'Chineseness', in turn, is affirmed as specifically defined via statehood – and especially of *imperial* statehood – and thus expanding and contracting in its definition over time, as empires expanded and contracted, and as they exerted and discarded claims to the credentials of 'Chinese' statehood. Indeed, in my view the use of 'Chinese' to very specifically refer to concepts linked to the narratives of a dominant state entity is probably the most intellectually consistent approach that can be taken, given the extreme fluidity of identity constructs below the state level.

So in the end, no, historians don't really have a single consistent definition of who 'Chinese people' are. In a best-case scenario they will at least try to define the term in question, but in general, 'Chinese' is genuinely used in a variety of ways that are *usually* understood to be based on some kind of relevant, period-specific conception. There have, of course, been attempts to problematise the use of 'Chinese': Prasenjit Duara's *Rescuing History from the Nation*, Pamela Crossley's *The Wobbling Pivot*, and Peter Perdue's review essay 'Classical China: A Singular Entity' have all done so. But the very word 'Chinese' is essentially so fundamental to the field – and interest still so relatively modern-skewed, to periods including the present where simple definitions of 'Chinese' are often peddled but rarely questioned – that efforts at its problematisation will likely continue for some while yet.

----- __1042.2__ -----2023-01-10 23:46:59+08:00:

Gosh, a lot of follow-ups. I'll try to address them as best I can.

As regards the 'foreignness' of the Manchus under the Qing, I would agree with the notion that we cannot use any definition of 'Chinese' other than the simple political one (i.e. 'China' as a shorthand for the Qing and any Qing subject as 'Chinese' as a result) to encompass the Qing-era Manchus. Simply put, Qing-era Manchus consciously identified as non-Han and as having, at minimum, a genealogical basis for seeing themselves as separate from the Han as a people. The assertion of an essential non-Chineseness on the Manchus' part is thus correct insofar as the Manchus themselves accepted this notion. However, we still ought to bear in mind a certain – but far from total – degree of acculturation among the Manchus, whose prolonged contact with Chinese urbanism combined with state attempts to promulgate an idealised 'Manchu Way' to produce a unique synthesis of Chinese and Northeast Asian cultural norms.

As for multiethnic vs 'mono-ethnic' states, I think we simply need to recognise that the notion of an ethnostate is pretty recent in world history, and that most societies have acknowledged – if not necessarily readily embraced – a certain degree of internal pluralism. You can come up with any number of examples of fuzzy edges when it comes to identity definitions: 'the English' is perhaps the most standard example, where colloquial uses have often encompassed basically the entirety of the British Isles, but even at less extreme stretches, you have fuzzy zones like the Cornish. Some would make the argument that a singular Japanese national (or at times racial) identity encompassing east and west didn't really come into being until the later Edo period. The simple fact is that any demonym is going to change over time in terms of its possible bases and consequent breadth.

I think dwelling on Lieven here will take us rather off topic: I should have specified that the work by Lieven I'm referring to is his recent popular press book *In the Shadow of the Gods: The Emperor in World History*, which is largely a work of synthesis discussing emperors (and empress regnants) across some 14 case studies; three of these concern China. Lieven is, however, mainly a historian of Russia. His focus on China is a result of it being one of the more long-lasting, or at least genealogically contiguous, examples of an imperial tradition of Eurasian history. Within that broader study of emperorship, Lieven takes the classic line that nationhood and empire are anathema, but he does argue that China is an unusual case where the imperial polity has been held together through attempts to enforce a national identity within its borders. But again, we need to regard Lieven's interpretation of China as one framed through his particular read of secondary sources (which exactly I have not checked), and while he's definitely a decent historian he's not a China specialist. Nor does he really engage with the empires not generally considered part of the 'canon' of succession.

As for how to approach the Liao or Qara Khitai (or Western Xia for that matter), there's a couple of ways to go about it. Competing imperial claims could be the basis for arguing for the existence of multiple competing Chinas. Or we can use 'China' in geographical terms and refer to any state significantly occupying part of it as being 'Chinese' – something that would probably exclude Qara Khitai (which was located primarily in what is now Xinjiang) but not Western Xia (which ruled mainly over Han subjects in Gansu). But there are approaches that may still accept the notion of a single primary 'China' while heavily qualifying it: Morris Rossabi frames what is sometimes termed the 'Song-Liao-Jin period' as 'China Among Equals', a period in which claimants to the Chinese imperial mantle were at odds and unable to decisively overcome each other, and in which therefore the notional 'China' (i.e. the Song) was unable to actually consider itself an all-encompassing entity.

----- __1042.3__ -----2023-01-13 20:44:43+08:00:

There are quite a few valid questions here but they're a bit tangled. You actually caught me out here – I'd forgotten the breadth of the Tangut empire, and so the Tanguts definitely ruled over more than just Han. But the fact that the Tanguts continued to exist would not inherently prevent them from having mostly Han subjects – the same is true of Manchu after all. Secondly, the southern states are considered more 'Han' because they were ruled by Han rulers and their subjects were defined as such, despite, as you are aware, being a mix of Han settlers and the descendants of indigenous peoples, but many such peoples (though far from all) had, through the processes of Han colonisation, been subsumed into that coloniser population. Those indigenous groups that did not become assimilated (whether forcibly or by choice) into a wider Han milieu often existed in highly autonomous polities whose subjection to 'Chinese' states was largely nominal.

> "Xixang," roughly translating to "Western Treasurehouse."

For what it's worth, 'Xizang' originated as a phonetic transliteration of Ü-Tsang. That's not, of course, to say that the choices of character to transliterate these terms may not have been influenced by cynicism, but my understanding is *zang* 藏 to transliterate Tsang goes back to at least the Mongol Yuan, a time when Tibet as an extractive colonial project probably did not apply.

Kiara mentioned wanting to do it before, well before she officially toned down the Takamori side. Not sure if Marine reminded her of it or if it's been somewhat planned for a while though.

At the time she straight up did not know there was a tax treaty, which there is – what the treaty does is prevent double-taxation, by having it that your total tax payment only equals the higher-taxing country's requirement. The *really* short version is that the tax you pay in one country can be claimed as tax credit in the other. So for instance if the US taxes you at 35% and Japan taxes you at 25%, you can pay 25% to Japan and then claim that as credit in the US, and only pay 10% to them, for 35% total. As of writing she has been made aware and I believe has an accountant handling it.

Hi! Thanks for coming to do this AMA with us. This is a question that is perhaps a little fuzzy and philosophical, but do you think myth has a place in the public view of history? Can there be, for lack of a better word, 'positive' myths, or is the nature of myth such that all myths are irretrievably problematic, even if to varying degrees? I ask because I'm reminded a bit of Paul A. Cohen's *History in Three Keys*, which simultaneously acknowledges myth as a valid sort of historical discourse, while condemning presentist mythologising, at least in the case of the Boxers. I will confess my recall of Cohen's theory in the book is by now a tad fuzzy, so apologies for any incoherence.
