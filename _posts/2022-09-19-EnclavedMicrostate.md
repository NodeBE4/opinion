**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to r/linguistics.

If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.

This submission has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or [moralizing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/) it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses.

### 820: [I’m Dr. Christian Raffensperger, author of Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus’ in the Medieval World, and I’m here to talk about medieval eastern Europe and, if you’re interested, the medieval factors in the war in Ukraine. AMA!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xj7y8j/im_dr_christian_raffensperger_author_of/), submitted on 2022-09-20 20:50:14+08:00.

----- __820.1__ -----2022-09-20 21:17:15+08:00:

Hi Dr Raffensperger, thanks for coming on to do this AMA with us.

My very superficial impression of Kievan Rus' is that it was dominated, at least politically and commercially, by Norse peoples, but that over time the Rus' polities increasingly reverted to the control of native Slavic dynasties. I feel like I can already guess that this impression is incorrect or at best horrifically oversimplified, but what actually was the relationship between Norse, Slavic, and indeed other peoples within the Rus' polity? Were Norse traders actually a relatively transient community whose influence declined? Did a more hybridised identity emerge that flattened out the differences, so to speak?

Thank you!

### 821: [TIL a section of the great wall of China stretches into Russia](https://old.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/xl3hbh/til_a_section_of_the_great_wall_of_china/), submitted on 2022-09-22 22:49:37+08:00.

----- __821.1__ -----2022-09-23 21:42:19+08:00:

Thanks to /u/Fluffy_Shoulder_57 for the ping. I'll re-link the relevant AH answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wb8na3/when_it_comes_to_the_great_wall_of_china_what_is/), but to condense out the key points, the 'wall' in Mongolia and Russia is in fact a set of earthworks built by non-Chinese states that happen to occasionally but inconsistently form part of the 'canonical' succession of 'dynasties', and 500 years before the *actual* 'Great Wall' built by the Ming. Earlier walls were actually very similar in construction, being un-reinforced earthworks, and had been *long* in disrepair since their abandonment during the Han. While the (non-Chinese) Northern Wei and Qi states built walls around Datong, this was a very limited set of construction compared to the earlier Warring States and later Ming efforts. In practical terms, the only fortifications we can seriously call the 'Great Wall' are the Warring States-to-Han defences and then the Ming network, with basically no equivalent in between.

----- __821.2__ -----2022-09-24 11:20:45+08:00:

> that splits Chinese controlled areas to other countries(like Russia, UK, Portugal), that’s how current China’s border are formed.

Um, no? The only full territorial concessions were, with the exception of Macau and Hong Kong, small leaseholds – international settlements in treaty ports, and a few naval bases like Port Arthur, Guangzhouwan, and Weihaiwei. There *were* broader economic 'spheres of influence' entitling certain powers exclusive rights to investment, but the Qing handed over very little in terms of direct territorial sovereignty.
