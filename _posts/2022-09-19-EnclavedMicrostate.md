### 809: [ISO a specific passage about Appomattox?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xhzg5r/iso_a_specific_passage_about_appomattox/), submitted on 2022-09-19 10:31:23+08:00.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

This submission has been removed because it involves current events.  To keep from discussion of politics, we have a [20-year rule](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events) here.  You may want to try /r/ask_politics, /r/NeutralPolitics, or another current-events focused sub. For further explanation of this rule, feel free to consult [this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glj8c4/rules_roundtable_xii_the_twenty_year_rule/).

### 811: [Who would win in a fight: a group of 100 tuscarora warriors vs 5 modern day highly skilled US marines with modern equipment?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xi1d48/who_would_win_in_a_fight_a_group_of_100_tuscarora/), submitted on 2022-09-19 12:05:44+08:00.

Sorry, but your submission has been removed because we [don't allow hypothetical questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_is_this_the_right_place_for_your_question.3F). If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).

### 812: [How are nonbinary people supposed to express themselves in languages which have only two grammatical genders?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xi1ybv/how_are_nonbinary_people_supposed_to_express/), submitted on 2022-09-19 12:35:44+08:00.

Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to r/linguistics.

If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.

### 813: [How much would it cost me to organize a medieval rally of 10,000 people including 100 rented horses/armor and weapon for the 10,000?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xi28y7/how_much_would_it_cost_me_to_organize_a_medieval/), submitted on 2022-09-19 12:51:24+08:00.

This submission has been removed because it violates our ['20-Year Rule'](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_current_events). To discourage off-topic discussions of current events, questions, answers, and all other comments must be confined to events that happened 20 years ago or more. For further explanation of this rule, feel free to consult [this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glj8c4/rules_roundtable_xii_the_twenty_year_rule/).
