### 820: [I’m Dr. Christian Raffensperger, author of Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus’ in the Medieval World, and I’m here to talk about medieval eastern Europe and, if you’re interested, the medieval factors in the war in Ukraine. AMA!](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xj7y8j/im_dr_christian_raffensperger_author_of/), submitted on 2022-09-20 20:50:14+08:00.

----- __820.1__ -----2022-09-20 21:17:15+08:00:

Hi Dr Raffensperger, thanks for coming on to do this AMA with us.

My very superficial impression of Kievan Rus' is that it was dominated, at least politically and commercially, by Norse peoples, but that over time the Rus' polities increasingly reverted to the control of native Slavic dynasties. I feel like I can already guess that this impression is incorrect or at best horrifically oversimplified, but what actually was the relationship between Norse, Slavic, and indeed other peoples within the Rus' polity? Were Norse traders actually a relatively transient community whose influence declined? Did a more hybridised identity emerge that flattened out the differences, so to speak?

### 822: [TIL a section of the great wall of China stretches into Russia](https://old.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/xl3hbh/til_a_section_of_the_great_wall_of_china/), submitted on 2022-09-22 22:49:37+08:00.

----- __822.1__ -----2022-09-23 21:42:19+08:00:

Thanks to /u/Fluffy_Shoulder_57 for the ping. I'll re-link the relevant AH answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wb8na3/when_it_comes_to_the_great_wall_of_china_what_is/), but to condense out the key points, the 'wall' in Mongolia and Russia is in fact a set of earthworks built by non-Chinese states that happen to occasionally but inconsistently form part of the 'canonical' succession of 'dynasties', and 500 years before the *actual* 'Great Wall' built by the Ming. Earlier walls were actually very similar in construction, being un-reinforced earthworks, and had been *long* in disrepair since their abandonment during the Han. While the (non-Chinese) Northern Wei and Qi states built walls around Datong, this was a very limited set of construction compared to the earlier Warring States and later Ming efforts. In practical terms, the only fortifications we can seriously call the 'Great Wall' are the Warring States-to-Han defences and then the Ming network, with basically no equivalent in between.

----- __822.2__ -----2022-09-24 11:20:45+08:00:

> that splits Chinese controlled areas to other countries(like Russia, UK, Portugal), that’s how current China’s border are formed.

Um, no? The only full territorial concessions were, with the exception of Macau and Hong Kong, small leaseholds – international settlements in treaty ports, and a few naval bases like Port Arthur, Guangzhouwan, and Weihaiwei. There *were* broader economic 'spheres of influence' entitling certain powers exclusive rights to investment, but the Qing handed over very little in terms of direct territorial sovereignty.

----- __822.3__ -----2022-09-24 11:34:07+08:00:

> The Great Wall was built 2000 years ago

500, actually, in terms of what we would recognise. While there were older earthworks these were not maintained past the Han period.

----- __822.4__ -----2022-09-24 14:14:31+08:00:

The Sino-Russian treaties are *complicated* but in short the two earlier treaties (Nerchinsk and Kiakhta) *gave* control of territory to the Qing, but the territory lost in the Aigun, Peking, and St Petersburg treaties were territories over which the Qing had never actually exercised significant meaningful control. So while this did affect the Russo-Chinese border it's not like land that was ancestrally Chinese suddenly vanished off the map, but rather the edges of the Manchu empire.

----- __822.5__ -----2022-09-24 14:14:38+08:00:

No, Mongolia declared independence in 1911.

**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).

Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions. 

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).

This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.
