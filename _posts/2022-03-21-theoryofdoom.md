Very insightful find.

If you're going to keep baselessly speculating, you're going to be temp-banned.  You need evidence to support that kind of claim, which you currently lack (and historically have as well).  

Think carefully about how, if at all, you respond to this post as well.  Just because you may disagree with me does not mean you get to violate all the other rules, which some people seem to forget.

----- __190.2__ -----2022-03-23 10:36:47+08:00:

We do not allow mindless prophecy of doom, on any timescale.  The era of unhinged speculation about impending armageddon without even plausible evidence to support such an inference is over.  

If a reasonable observer cannot distinguish your claim from something foretold by the oracle of delphi, it likely violates our rules.  

In your first post, you made a prediction about an anticipated future trend, which has not yet occurred, based on citation to exactly nothing.  I may as well have consulted the oracle of delphi, for her predictions on future COVID trends. 

Here, you have cited various sources which, while insufficient to support your expectations, at least rises to the level of minimal adequacy such that you're not currently violating any rules.

Further, if you want to discuss moderation, do it via modmail.  Do not DM mods individually.

This so-called "professor" with a publication history [of mindless nonsense](https://byu.academia.edu/EricRuizBybee), in [irrelevant journals](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15348458.2019.1671195?journalCode=hlie20) that [literally no one ever reads](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=journalMetrics&journalCode=hlie20) wants to whine about the kiddos saying mean things about his stupid assignments, online?

What a fucking disgrace.

----- __192.2__ -----2022-03-22 12:27:16+08:00:

He gets cited about [as much as incels get laid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tdEel6sAAAAJ).  That's what you call having an impact in your field, folks.  And his [field](https://education.byu.edu/directory/view/bybee-eric) is a joke.

----- __192.3__ -----2022-03-22 19:41:10+08:00:

Sorry, but you're mistaken.  If you were even able to publish something "baity and stupid," your peers would ignore it for the reason that it was "baity and stupid."  You can't inflate your h-index just by trying to game the system.

> ad hominem is not an argument

And the sky is blue, on occasion.  Shall we continue to exchange platitudes? 

> and in general the number of citations is a rather weak measure of quality. 

Keep your eye on the ball.  I said: "[t]hat's what you call having an impact in your field, folks," as you can read above.  "Impact in your field" and "quality" aren't the same thing.  

I agree that you can have a whole bunch of citations if you tag along other people's research (happens in medical publications all the time).  In that case, you're not really moving the ball forward so much as riding on the coattails of others' effort to do so.  

But our friend the BYU professor isn't even in that boat.  

> e.g. in my field you can get loads of citations by doing trivial shit as long as trendy topics are involved.

What field might that be?  Because I'll let you in on a secret.  Idpol journals no one ever reads don't publish according to the same standards as, say, medical journals.

----- __192.5__ -----2022-03-22 20:20:24+08:00:

I have a tendency to be sanctimonious in the face of idpol stupidity.

----- __192.6__ -----2022-03-23 11:56:12+08:00:

That was a pretty good find.  Read the abstract, anc couldn't help but laugh.  Reminds me of a Noam Chomsky lecture, recorded in one of the books he's published, where he talks about the language games certain types of normative theorists play to make what they're doing seem more sophisticated than it is.

> Hard times create good men

Croatians of his age have blood equity in the values he's talking about.  When you've lived through something like that, seeing a so called liberal western liberal "leader" repudiate the civil liberty they claim to represent isn't just a moral indignation.  It's an abomination.  What Trudeau did would be like if Trump cited congressional authority given to FDR to fight the Third Reich, to destroy Black Lives Matter and anyone who ever voiced support for it.

### 194: [Airlines ask Biden to drop mask mandate and testing requirements for travelers](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/tmajdx/airlines_ask_biden_to_drop_mask_mandate_and/), submitted on 2022-03-24 21:35:58+08:00.

----- __194.1__ -----2022-03-25 03:25:13+08:00:

Obviously your comment violates Rule 1.  But even if it didn't, didn't you realize you posted it three different times?

----- __194.2__ -----2022-03-25 03:37:52+08:00:

People should absolutely have the choice of whether to wear a mask in any context, including on commercial flights.  No one is saying otherwise. 

But there are things people fail to consider, because they don't think things through.

Airline employees, particularly flight attendants, have been the subject of untold harassment for quite some time.  Sometimes even rising to the level of physical violence.  Airlines themselves have incurred tremendous costs associated with enforcing these futile mandates, whether from delayed flights or in connection with all the variously related legal liabilities.  

Those costs make it more expensive for consumers to fly, because the airlines have to pass those costs off to consumers.  They also make the risk of air travel much higher, by substantially increasing the risk of confrontation between passengers and crew or other passengers.  

So it's not enough to just say "masks on airlines!  Because we think they matter!"  The whole picture has to be considered, namely in view of whether masks are redundant or futile by other measures. 

It turns out that commercial aircraft have really excellent air filtration systems.  This is necessary, because the air you breathe on a plane is recycled after being filtered through medical-grade air purification methods that are vastly more effective than any commercially available mask.  Air is cycled through the cabin at rates that prevent any aerosolized viral material from accumulating in the cabin, which is the primary modality of infection.  

On trains, busses or in other contexts, the same can't be said.  But for planes, those costs are incurred without any added benefit to consumers whatsoever.
