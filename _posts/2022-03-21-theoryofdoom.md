If you're going to keep baselessly speculating, you're going to be temp-banned.  You need evidence to support that kind of claim, which you currently lack (and historically have as well).  

Think carefully about how, if at all, you respond to this post as well.  Just because you may disagree with me does not mean you get to violate all the other rules, which some people seem to forget.
