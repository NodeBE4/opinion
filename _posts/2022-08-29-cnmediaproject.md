The “Two Establishes,” a key buzzword to signal Xi Jinping’s power and prestige within the Chinese Communist Party, had a stellar start in August. But it has rapidly lost its shine. What does this mean for the crucial CCP congress that lies ahead? <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/30/changes-at-the-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/08/30/changes-at-the-core/</a>

Re The first half of August 2022 saw 34 articles in the People's Daily using the "Two Establishes." In the second half? Just 8 so far, with one day to go.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbYEB5eakAAYntd?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Earlier this month CMP looked at the bizarre case of four Chinese propaganda documentaries winning prizes at minor or fake international festivals.

Re You might also check out our investigation into the documentary "China: Time of Xi." How a series presented in state media as a production by the “independent production company Meridian Line Films" led right back to the Central Propaganda Department. <a href="https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n6824/pdf/documenting_china.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n6824/pdf/documenting_china.pdf</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbYJ5fyaQAEfqJP?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Near total silence in China's media on the OHCHR report on Xinjiang today. But while we wait for the fire-breathing, a quick dive into the CCP's front organizations for human rights engagement. <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/01/chinas-civil-society-front-on-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/01/chinas-civil-society-front-on-human-rights/</a>

The CCP’s flagship People’s Daily reported along with other state media in early July that the China Society of Human Rights had released a new report called “US Commits Grave Human Rights Violations in the Middle East and Elsewhere.” Who is the CSHRS? 1/3 <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/01/chinas-civil-society-front-on-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/09/01/chinas-civil-society-front-on-human-rights/</a>

Re CSHRS refers to itself as “the largest national non-governmental organization in the field of human rights in China." The group is “active in human rights studies," it says. But its funding comes mainly from the China Foundation for Human Rights Development. CFHRD?<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbjmiW9agAAyaGi.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" webkit-playsinline="" playsinline="" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/FbjmiW9agAAyaGi.jpg"></video>

Re CFHRD calls itself a “public foundation.” But it also states unambiguously in its formal charter from 1994 that “the business unit in charge is the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (Information Office of the State Council).”<br><video src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbjmrOfaQAEs2sS.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" webkit-playsinline="" playsinline="" controls="controls" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/FbjmrOfaQAEs2sS.jpg"></video>
