So easy to conclude that Xi will take home all the prizes at the upcoming 20th NC. But that is not necessarily set in stone.

Summaries and predictions now abound on the 20th National Congress, which will open on Sunday. CMP's David Bandurski looks instead at a simple but crucial concept: the vision of China's future as a duality resting on Xi the man and on his "thought." <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/13/the-spirit-at-the-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/13/the-spirit-at-the-core/</a>

Re This "banner term" will almost certainly be shortened to "Xi Jinping Thought" (习近平思想) at the 20th National Congress in a few days — drawing Xi even with Mao Zedong in terms of the elevation of his personal leadership philosophy and the dominance that comes with it. 3/4<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fe_gjw1aYAAfyd2?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Thanks for tuning in! We await the release of the full-text. But perhaps more important will be how state media report on Xi — his banner phrase and other matters.

No mention yet in the People's Daily of a shortened form of Xi's banner term as "Xi Jinping Thought" (习近平思想). The longer phrase of course figured strongly in the 30,000-plus word chronicle released several days ago. We analyzed that here: <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/14/writing-the-future-into-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/14/writing-the-future-into-history/</a>

In commentary on CCTV after Xi's political report, it was mentioned that the version read by Xi Jinping was not the full-text version of the report. Once the full version is released, there could be more surprises. So far, though, no real surprises stand out.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfKdwnQagAEsSmx?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
