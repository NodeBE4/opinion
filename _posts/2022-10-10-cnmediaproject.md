BBC Chinese looks at several political terms in China ahead of the 20th National Congress, with comment from CMP's David Bandurski. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-63211713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-63211713</a>

So easy to conclude that Xi will take home all the prizes at the upcoming 20th NC. But that is not necessarily set in stone. Prognostication is a perilous business.<br><br>Bill Bishop: Here’s how Xi Jinping climbed to the center of China’s political universe by rewriting the rules<br> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-china-national-party-congress-xi-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-china-national-party-congress-xi-rules/</a>

Summaries and predictions now abound on the 20th National Congress, which will open on Sunday. CMP's David Bandurski looks instead at a simple but crucial concept: the vision of China's future as a duality resting on Xi the man and on his "thought." <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/13/the-spirit-at-the-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/13/the-spirit-at-the-core/</a>

Even references to the seen cannot be seen. The control of information and ideas seems to have reached new heights of absurdity.

Re Such absurdity can be seen throughout the history of the CCP. Here is an example from 1974, when images overlapping on two sides of a newspaper became a scandal. <a href="https://medium.com/@cmphku/fatal-errors-74f3a0112363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://medium.com/@cmphku/fatal-errors-74f3a0112363</a>

Prominent on today's front page of the People's Daily is an article about China's answers to questions domestic and global — that emphasizes Xi Jinping's "soaring" innovation of socialism for the 21st century. 1/4 <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-10/14/nw.D110000renmrb_20221014_2-01.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-10/14/nw.D110000renmrb_20221014_2-01.htm</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fe_e_6eaMAA8-nV?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re When it talks of the critical importance of "banners" for charting the future 举什么旗、走什么路 it is of course talking about the need to rally under the banner of "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era." 2/4<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fe_f1CvacAINa4R?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re This "banner term" will almost certainly be shortened to "Xi Jinping Thought" (习近平思想) at the 20th National Congress in a few days — drawing Xi even with Mao Zedong in terms of the elevation of his personal leadership philosophy and the dominance that comes with it. 3/4<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fe_gjw1aYAAfyd2?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re For more on the dual aspect of Xi's elevation as the leadership "core" and as the spirit animating China's future, see David Bandurski's analysis yesterday, "The Spirit at the Core." 4/4 <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/13/the-spirit-at-the-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2022/10/13/the-spirit-at-the-core/</a>

As is typical ahead of the CCP National Congress, we also have today an official chronicle of "major events" in the past five years. This sprawls across eight pages. <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-10/14/nw.D110000renmrb_20221014_5-01.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-10/14/nw.D110000renmrb_20221014_5-01.htm</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fe_iBtcacAEzj8f?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re If you choose NOT to read this massive accounting of Xi's glories, you might opt to read instead the Q&amp;A on page 8, in which an official from the Central Institute of Party History and Literature talks about the process. <a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-10/14/nw.D110000renmrb_20221014_1-08.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2022-10/14/nw.D110000renmrb_20221014_1-08.htm</a><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fe_jVx-aUAAkJ9t?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
