Our paper "How government-controlled media shifts policy attitudes through framing" w/ @xuyiqing, ZijieShao is out. We show experimentally how framing policy issues differently allows government-controlled media to move public opinion toward opposing sides of the same issue.<br><br>CUP Politics: #FirstView from @PSRMJournal -<br><br>How government-controlled media shifts policy attitudes through framing - <br><br>- @jenjpan, Zijie Shao &amp; @xuyiqing<br><br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6z50j8WUAIQuh7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> <a href="http://ow.ly/akuV50FAm3z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://ow.ly/akuV50FAm3z</a>

Re Treatment: domestic & foreign video news segments in style of CCTV. Domestic: SOE reform should be *Market* vs. *State* led. Foreign: China should take *Dovish* vs. *Hawkish* stance in South China Sea disputes w/ Philippines. *Control* segments show no policy stance.<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E61ZF7LX0AAQlF8?format=png&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re Strikingly, exposure to different frames of same issue moves preferences regardless of predisposition. (There's strong correlations btw predisposition &  post-treatment preferences, suggesting preferences are relatively coherent & results not due to demand effects).<br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E61aa0QXoAI3eEF?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
