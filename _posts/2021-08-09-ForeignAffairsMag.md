\[SS from the article by Ye Liu, Senior Lecturer in International Development at King’s College London.\]

The simple truth is that far too few Chinese women of childbearing age want to have more than one child. The irony is that this preference for smaller families is partly the result of China’s economic progress, which has created a world of professional opportunities for women that would have been unimaginable in the 1980s. The trouble is that although China needs more babies, the CCP also needs women to continue to participate in the labor force and, more broadly, in the economy. In American terms, the CCP wants Chinese women to “have it all.” To put it mildly, however, the party has not figured out how to help them do that.

In a multiyear research project, I have conducted ongoing interviews with a group of 82 Chinese women from across the socioeconomic spectrum, between the ages of 30 and 37. None of them have any siblings; they are products of the one-child policy and the country that it made. What emerges from in-depth conversations with them is the extent to which the CCP has ignored the crucial role they play in shaping China’s future and how the party has neglected to take steps that could help reverse the country’s demographic decline: putting more women in leadership positions, preventing discrimination against women in the workplace, making quality childcare more affordable, and accepting that a preference for smaller families is unlikely to fade—which will probably make it necessary to raise the age at which people become eligible for government-funded pensions, in order to avoid a disastrous decline in the size of the labor force.

\[SS from the essay\]

The recent spate of ransomware attacks by nonstate actors has upended the conventional wisdom about the nature of the cyberthreat to the United States. U.S. national security experts have historically focused on preparing for Armageddon-like scenarios in which foreign governments target critical infrastructure and crucial networks. Until recently, cybercrime and other malicious activities carried out by independent hackers barely registered as concerns in the highest levels of the government. As a result, the U.S. national security apparatus is not currently hardwired to defend the nation’s critical infrastructure from cyberattacks perpetrated by organized crime groups.  
The usual U.S. playbook for responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks is unfortunately not very useful when applied to organized crime. Typical responses to state-sponsored cyberattacks—such as naming, shaming, and indicting or sanctioning the perpetrators—will not deter Russian organized crime groups from conducting future attacks. Robust and offensive cyber-action against potential hackers may seem like an attractive alternative, but as the cyber-campaign against ISIS revealed, it is difficult to execute.
