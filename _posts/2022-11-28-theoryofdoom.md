Only idiots (e.g., internet "lawyers") think you can use the fighting words doctrine to get out of assault/battery or property destruction-related charges.  And adolescent boys are the only ones who think kicking in the driver's side window with someone sitting inside is an appropriate response to name-calling.  

I feel for the window-kicking kid.  But his life would be better without a criminal record.  

As for the kid in the car, this is one of your classic "fuck around and find out" type situations.  Though I doubt he took the correct lesson from this experience.
