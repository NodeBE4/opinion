RT Li Yuan<br>China is using the guise of antitrust to cement the Communist Party’s monopoly of power, with private enterprises likely to lose what’s left of their independence and become a mere appendage of the state. My take on the heart of the #didi fiasco. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/what-china-expects-from-businesses-total-surrender.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/what-china-expects-from-businesses-total-surrender.html?smid=tw-share</a>

CMP's quick take on official media coverage of floods in Zhengzhou today. The story between the headlines -- Premier Li seems to have been completely sidelined as Xi Jinping's "important instructions" are reported w/out Li's "written comments". <a href="https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/07/21/as-disaster-strikes-xi-takes-the-headlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chinamediaproject.org/2021/07/21/as-disaster-strikes-xi-takes-the-headlines/</a><br><img style src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E608sqTX0AI_eNO?format=jpg&name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
