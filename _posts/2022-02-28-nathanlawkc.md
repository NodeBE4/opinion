Energy dependency on Russia made the EU very reluctant to act in the first place. We are too dependent on Russia and China — start to decrease reliance and divest from them NOW. Banning all slave-labored product, limiting investment both from and to China is the first step.

1/ The book “Freedom” warns the world how fragile and precious freedom is — thus part of the revenue is donated to the fight for freedom in Ukraine 🇺🇦.<br>We need more doers not talkers. From Russia to China, from right to vote to right from fear, we are all in this together.<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMxUVDrWYAgZqzY?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 2/ Democracy is a project — a long and difficult one, that guarantees no success. But we are determined to walk this path. I am a human rights activist, refugee and definitely not rich. I do it because I believe in helping the people protect democracy; it’s helping your democracy<br><img style="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMxUh0jWYAk3Nm2?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

Re 3/ These organizations support medical needs, refugees, education, humanitarian assistance on the ground. It’s for humanity, and our shared values.
