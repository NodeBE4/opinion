<p>I’ve no idea if it was bullshit at the time and if it’s still accepted now, but many years ago I read an article that noted that money correlates with happiness <em>up to a point</em>, that being where your perceived basic needs are met <em>and</em> you have a certain amount to spend on yourself. So even if there are plenty of people who are at the point where more money won’t make a difference, there are plenty more who aren’t.</p>

<p>Hans van de Ven’s <em>China at War</em> is relatively recent and probably the best militaristically-inclined approach to the Second Sino-Japanese War, and also has a somewhat compressed but still decent denouement covering the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. My only real quibble with it is with van de Ven’s interpretation of the role of guerrilla warfare in Clausewitz and in turn its interpretation by Mao, insofar as I think Clausewitz’s thinking was more similar to Mao’s than he makes out, and that in turn Mao’s approach to Clausewitz was thus not hugely innovative.</p>

<p>Unluckily for you, the signs are in Cantonese rather than Mandarin (both the lexicon and the rhyme scheme give that away). Also unluckily, the phrases are not translations of each other, but rather phrases with similar (intended) meaning. Fortunately for you, I do speak Cantonese, and am willing to at least claim to be your friend for the purposes of translating.</p>

<p>‘You are my love my angle don’t treat me like potato’ originally would have meant, idiomatically, ‘I treat you like a jewel, don’t treat me like swamp grass’. So, no potatoes here.</p>

<p>‘You talk like angel walk like model but your body look like buffalo’ originally would have been ‘looking from a distance you are picturesque, looking up close you’re a pork chop’. This requires a couple of explanations. The phrase in the first clause meaning ‘picturesque’ is actually miswritten as 如絲如畫 ‘like silk, like artwork’ instead of the standard 如詩如畫 ‘like poetry, like artwork’; this is, by the by, another giveaway that it’s Cantonese because both 絲 and 詩 are <em>si1</em> in Cantonese, but <em>si1</em> and <em>shi1</em> respectively in Mandarin. The term ‘pork chop’ is Cantonese slang for an unattractive woman.</p>

<p>You can actually find the full sign for the rambo phrase here: https://preview.redd.it/fk8q423um1l21.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=cc1a8b6d447add7cbbb26d31cb3366a83855f4b7. Idiomatically, the Cantonese would be along the lines of ‘your head is big but you have no brain; your brain is just a big pile of grass’. No potatoes here either.</p>

<p>Cantonese (at least HK Cantonese, other varieties may be different) for ‘potato’ is 薯仔 <em>syu4 zai2</em>.</p>

<p>It depends how you speak it, and whether you do so as your first language. In the case of Hong Kong Cantonese speakers, there are certain distinctions in tone and emphasis from American/Commonwealth English speakers. In particular, there tends to be one syllable that gets pitched up and held, but never the final one, which is always a bit de-emphasised and so sound differences are not as obvious. So for instance <em>a-n</em>gel, po<em>ta-</em>to, <em>mo-</em>del, <em>buff-</em>alo. Secondly, Cantonese doesn’t have a final ‘l’ sound, so it is often replaced by simply holding the vowel. What that means is ‘angel’ ends up sounding like ‘ain-jo’, which would rhyme with ‘potato’, and similarly ‘model’ becomes ‘mod-oh’, which would rhyme with ‘buffalo’.</p>

<p>So no, they don’t rhyme in ‘standard’ British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, or American English, but they do rhyme in strongly Cantonese-accented English.</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for coming on! I’ll try to make this a question rather than a statement.</p>

<p>In the admittedly somewhat cursory reading I’ve done on the Red Flag pirates of early 19th century China, a theme that seems to have emerged is that the role of Ching Shih (also known by other names) in the fleet was deliberately exaggerated by elite male Qing authors to emphasise the pirates’ deviation from orthodox social norms. How did gender affect how female pirates were written about compared to their male counterparts? I suppose a necessary corollary to that is, <em>who</em> wrote about pirates? How strongly do women’s voices feature in the source landscape?</p>

It <em>might</em> have been Murray but to be honest, it might even have been an older post on AH by a user whose name I have long since forgotten.

Between 1987 and 1992, the city was evicted to be demolished. How were the logistics of relocating and re-employing so many people over only five years solved?</a>, submitted on 2022-08-11 04:43:45+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>692.1</strong> —–2022-08-11 13:12:53+08:00:</p>

<p>The answer above, and indeed the question, necessarily presume a little bit of background knowledge on the Walled City which not all readers may have, so I’m filling that in in order to pre-empt what I think may end up being the most common follow-up questions on that count.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is important to note that while the first Google results for ‘Kowloon’ give you the Walled City, Kowloon and the Kowloon Walled City are not synonymous terms. Kowloon, from Cantonese 九龍 <em>gau2 lung4</em> (‘nine dragons’), has had two meanings historically. Firstly, it referred to the 47km^2 peninsula ceded to Britain under the Convention of Peking in 1860, bounded on the north side by the appropriately-named Boundary Street. Secondly, it referred to a town to the northeast of that ceded territory, which would later become the Kowloon Walled City (九龍寨城 <em>gau2 lung4 zaai6 seng4</em>). In the decades after the New Territories lease in 1898, the urban area of Kowloon expanded significantly, so the modern-day boundaries of Kowloon, which encompass the districts of Kowloon City, Kwun Tong, Sham Shui Po, Wong Tai Sin, and Yau Tsum Mong, include a further 20 km^2 or so of land that was leased in 1898 rather than ceded in 1860; this whole area was known as Kowloon by at least 1982, when the precursor to the modern district boundaries were laid down. The Walled City, which by this stage was no longer simply called ‘Kowloon’, formed a small enclave within what is now the district of Kowloon City. Nor was it dominant in population terms: the upper-end estimate of 50,000 residents would have constituted less than 2.5% of the 2.03 million residents of Kowloon, and less than 1% of the roughly 5.67 million residents of Hong Kong as a whole.</p>

<p>The emergence of the Walled City relates directly to the aforementioned treaties. The 1898 lease explicitly excluded ‘the city of Kowloon’, which the Qing used as a military outpost, and it remained under <em>de jure</em> Qing jurisdiction until the imperial state fell in 1912. Its ambiguous legal status meant that there was no investment in the area by British public authorities, and both the Republic of China and latterly the People’s Republic of China would claim to continue the Qing’s jurisdiction, but had very little means of enforcing it through British territory, nor much intent to do so. This put the Walled City in a bit of a legal loophole where the British colonial government had no jurisdiction to exercise, while the mainland governments claimed jurisdiction but could not and would not meaningfully exercise it. The Walled City in the form it is best known – a dense chunk of buildings up to 14 storeys high, crisscrossed by damp alleyways – was the result of considerable construction works that took place in the 1960s, as the Walled City essentially became a high-rise version of the earlier squatter communities mentioned in the above answer, housing those who could not afford to live elsewhere for financial reasons, or who deliberately sought out the legal grey zone to carry out various illicit businesses.</p>

<p>—– <strong>692.2</strong> —–2022-08-11 14:18:54+08:00:</p>

<p>The decision to demolish the city was made in 1987 by mutual British and PRC agreement, with the handover agreement having been made back in 1984. Issues with its status had been threefold: firstly it was a haven for various forms of illegal and unregistered businesses, secondly there were considerable health and safety concerns, and thirdly, it also lay in the flight path for the Runway 13 approach to what was then the Hong Kong International Airport at Kai Tak, already a particularly tricky one even without buildings in the way. Feasibility studies for a replacement for Kai Tak would not begin until the year after. So with the handover now agreed to, both parties agreed that the demolition could go ahead.</p>

<p>—– <strong>692.3</strong> —–2022-08-11 18:42:32+08:00:</p>

<p>So the long story short is it didn’t. In theory, it could have done. The Convention is quite explicit on key counts concerning the Walled City (indeed, arguably more space is devoted to the ‘city of Kowloon’ than to any other thing). Quoting the relevant sections:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is at the same time agreed that within the city of Kowloon the Chinese officials now stationed there shall continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as may be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong. Within the remainder of the newly-leased territory Great Britain shall have sole jurisdiction. Chinese officials and people shall be allowed as heretofore to use the road from Kowloon to Hsinan.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is further agreed that the existing landing-place near Kowloon city shall be reserved for the convenience of Chinese men-of-war, merchant 
and passenger vessels, which may come and go and lie there at their pleasure ; and for the convenience of movement of the officials and people within the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is further understood that there will be no expropriation or expulsion of the inhabitants of the district included within the extension, and 
that if land is required for public offices, fortifications, or the like official purposes, it shall be bought at a fair price.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If cases of extradition of criminals occur, they shall be dealt with in accordance with the existing treaties between Great Britain and China  and the Hong Kong Regulations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there was a very clear set of stipulations as to how the Qing could maintain an official presence – even an armed one within reason – within their existing settlement (which I will refer to here as Kowloon City, as distinguished from Kowloon in the sense of the 1860 concession). The Qing were in fact willing to make use of that provision, and in April 1899, in the wake of the Six-Day War between the British garrison and villagers in the New Territories protesting land reform, the Qing sent 600 reinforcements to Kowloon City on top of an existing garrison of just under 550. Most of this garrison was soon withdrawn under pressure, leaving just 200 men by 4 May, and it would then be expelled in the second half of the month when British troops marched in to occupy Kowloon City in parallel with a temporary occupation of Shum Chun (aka Shenzhen) as a result of tensions that had mounted over allegations that the Qing Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi, Tan Zhonglin, had sent the reinforcements in April in an attempt to aid the rebels. After this was defused, the British occupation force left, but the Qing garrison and local officials did not return. In other words, the Qing jurisdiction was only practically exercised for 10 months before it was abandoned – hence my noting that it was purely <em>de jure</em>.</p>

<p>What followed was a period in which the British government basically put Kowloon City in legal limbo, voiding the existing land ownership of any remaining inhabitants (not that many, as the civilian population had never been more than about 200) and issuing 5-year leases in their place. Public services would effectively be provided by the Church of England, which maintained chapels, schools, orphanages, and medical facilities, but there was virtually no new construction of private houses, which were largely in disrepair. The British would, in 1933, announce plans to demolish the houses, but the ROC government protested on the grounds that this would violate the 1898 Convention, and refused to accept any proposed British intervention. When the restored colonial government made a second attempt in 1947, again it was rebuffed by the ROC. After that, the colonial government simply chose not to press the issue, and essentially allowed the Walled City to expand upwards.</p>

<p>It was a community of outcasts, but one linked to the city around them, and which therefore couldn’t exactly be stopped from contracting and subcontracting builders from the British city. In terms of renting and ownership, while there wasn’t a firm legal mechanism to confirm ownership of property, apartments were privately owned and rented out: there’s several references to this in the translated testimonies reproduced in Girard and Lambot’s <em>City of Darkness</em>, cited in the above answer. To cite just three examples which illustrate somewhat different levels of financial fortune:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been around the City for the past 25 years. Actually, we used to be In Sai Tau Village [the adjoining ‘squatter’ settlement pulled down in 1985]. When we first moved here the rent was a little over $100 a month; now it’s about $1300. This building used to be a three-storey block until it was rebuilt. During the redevelopment we moved next door for eight or nine months.– <em>Hui Tung Choy, noodle shop owner</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been around the City for some 30 or 40 years. We took over the store for $13000, though this included several thousand dollars’ worth of stock in cigarettes and about a $1000 worth of medicine… I still own a flat on the fifth floor too, and that pays me $1000 in rent each month. I don’t need a lot of money. – <em>Yau Lap Cheong, retired shopkeeper</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a place across the alley. I bought a wooden hut for about $3000 and then, about 20 years ago, I asked a contractor to build a 10-storey building to replace it. It cost more than $100,000. Each storey was about 500 square feet. We kept four for ourselves and sold the rest for $30,000 each. It took several months to build. The architectural plans were drawn up by the contractor, and he arranged the electricity and water supplies as well. – <em>Lam Mei Kwong, doctor</em></p>

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth">rules concerning the scope of questions</a>. However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.</p>

<p>So for example, if you wanted to ask, “<em>Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?</em>” we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask “<em>In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?</em>” we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

<p>It’s an interesting podcast that is worth a listen, though if I’m not mistaken the host is (or at least, was at time of production) a lowkey cryptobro. He seems to believe there are legitimate crypto use cases, and that aside from being a scam in itself, OneCoin poisoned the well around crypto. The takeaway really – imo – is that it is arguably the best example of how crypto all runs on hype, in that one of the most invested-in crypto schemes ever turned out to not even require any of its core technology.</p>

<p>I discuss the ‘mutiny’ (or otherwise) at the Hyphasis River in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qzlynj/what_scared_alexanders_soldiers_when_they_reached/hlr177l/">this past answer</a>. As ever, there are multiple contradictory versions that are equally, or at least comparably, legitimate.</p>

<p>That said, to quickly address the more specific wording of your question I think the answer is to say that both perspectives are, in some sense, correct. On the one hand, Alexander did not suffer any battlefield defeats in India. But on the other, there is broad concurrence in the sources that by 326 BCE, the Macedonian army had suffered heavy material attrition and was deeply demoralised. While that is far from being the same as having ‘lost on the battlefield’, which would imply some covered-up tactical disaster, it would be correct to say that the army was ‘sufficiently weakened that he [Alexander] could not progress further’.</p>

<p>—– <strong>707.2</strong> —–2022-08-16 11:50:46+08:00:</p>

<p>There’s always a <em>theoretical possibility</em> that the sources have engaged in some major cover-up, but it’s one that is, in this case, so slim as to be absurd. Among other things we need to consider what ‘conquest’ really means, because in Alexander’s case this could, in some cases, simply mean receiving the submission of a particular locale’s existing rulers. In the case of India, this meant that he ultimately affirmed the status of Taxiles (or Ambhi) and Poros (yes, the one he defeated at the Hydaspes) in their existing kingdoms, but with an at least claimed submission to Alexander; granted these two men were given rule over additional territory that Alexander had fought over. When exactly Alexander is supposed to have <em>formally</em> reinstalled these two kings is not 100% clear but is supposed to have occurred after the incident on the Hyphasis, so you <em>could</em> argue that this was somehow to do with a failure of Macedonian administration in the roughly one year period since defeating Poros, but to be frank I do not see how you would. Among other things, it isn’t clear that Poros and Taxiles <em>weren’t</em> handling the interim administration. That said, it’s not impossible that there’d be a revolt against these new clients, but if there was, it’s hard to see why Alexander would keep them.</p>

<p>I think there is an important conversation to be had about how disliking or opposing the CCP and/or emigrating from China doesn’t mean that a person disagrees with the core tenets of modern Chinese ultranationalism, its attendant emphases on purist ideals of masculinity and femininity, or, as a direct extension of that, queerphobia in all its guises. ‘I, as a cishet Han Chinese person, believe I deserve more political rights’ is not fundamentally in conflict with Han-centric nationalism, nor does it logically follow that this position would also entail supporting rights for minorities (of any kind).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think the issue has to do in part with <em>most</em> ‘Corpo’ VTubers still being original IPs and not existing characters, as well as the general affirmation of the principle of one talent to one VTuber which makes Tony the Tiger, a frequently-recast mascot, definitely a transgression of typical norms of the scene.</p>

<p>I very deliberately kept quiet about this at the time because I didn’t think it deserved getting too much attention in the heat of it, but there was a bit of a blow-up in the Hololive community about a week ago when a Redditor who was a BNF of its male branch, Holostars, went on a public tirade and declared they were quitting both the Hololive and Holostars subs because the Hololive subreddit moderators wouldn’t answer his repeated calls (over the course of a year and a half, apparently) to increase their promotion of Holostars content, and as a parting shot broadcast the Discord handle of r Hololive’s head mod, just to make sure that they, er, would immediately destroy any potential goodwill on the part of the community?</p>

<p>What <em>then</em> became apparent was that they had been actively harassing the mods of at least one other subreddit (although the user making this claim mods 17 subs and didn’t specify which in particular) in a similar manner, so that was also unpleasant for many to have discovered.</p>

<p>There’s really not <em>that</em> much to add to be honest, though summaries and links can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wjap40/pipsimon_projection_paradrop_weekly_discussion/ijol160/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wjap40/pipsimon_projection_paradrop_weekly_discussion/ijxhfq0/">here</a> on the VirtualYoutubers sub – names are named, so visit at your peril.</p>

<p>So here’s the thing, right: <em>most</em> of these are basically true? Like, Virginia Woolf <em>did</em> actually dress in blackface and a fake beard to pretend to be an Ethiopian diplomat and actually fooled the Royal Navy, for instance. Roald Dahl <em>was</em> a virulent anti-Semite. And Orson Scott Card is <em>really</em> a real piece of work.</p>

<p>But it’s the individual <em>wild</em> ones that stand out. John Green being an implicit antisemite is… fascinatingly weird; ditto Stephenie Meyer being pro-underage relationships; and most bewilderingly Asian-American novelist Celeste Ng being accused of anti-Asian racism.</p>

<p>But on the flip-side you have all these 19th/20th century authors whom it seems like she only knows <em>of</em> but hasn’t really read, and so simply accuses them of ‘racism’ and not <em>all the other stuff as well</em>. Enid Blyton was plenty xenophobic and liked traditional gender roles, so that’s more than just racism there. Any Rand [sic] was surely more than just racist. And is racism the <em>only</em> thing you can dob Rudyard Kipling for?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, raving antisemite despite actually serving in the RAF in WW2 (he was quite literally a fighter ace at that, having shot down 5 enemy aircraft). You can (many TWs) read up a bit on his views <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/archive/2021/10/from-the-ns-archive-tale-of-the-unexpected">here</a> if you’d like (but… you probably don’t want to).</p>

<p>To be ‘fair’, the Tempus ban was lifted after the outburst so he wouldn’t have known. Not that that makes it <em>better</em> by any means.</p>

<p>Remember, China is neither nationalist nor eugenicist, and has no notions of racial purity.</p>

<p>It’s a thing that pops up in wargaming rules too, and to be honest I think the argument can swing both ways. Here it’s even more drastic because wargaming tends to be done with D6s, so an automatic fail on 1 and automatic success on 6 is way more common.</p>

<p>The justification is, in my view, sensible enough, especially for automatic success on 6: let’s imagine I have a situation where a unit is shooting at the limit of its effective range and could hit on a 5, but let’s say the defender has a cover modifier that reduces it by -2, making hits mathematically impossible. This wouldn’t make sense in the real world, though: some hits <em>should</em> still be scored. Similarly, if you’re at really close range and have some other modifier, your hit rate still shouldn’t be exactly 100%.</p>

<p>I’m kind of surprised how quickly the toxic side of fandom came out after what had been a genuine outpouring of grief but also goodwill from the rest of the community. I half-wonder if Kson and Nazuna (formerly Hololive’s Coco and Rushia) joining VShojo, which has itself fired a lot of PR shots at Hololive recently, has led to the hardcore tribalists going after anyone who looks to be betraying the brand somehow.</p>

<p>While I don’t <em>utterly</em> disagree, I don’t think that’s a fair statement in this case, where the core issue is a specific – and relatively high-profile – VTuber giving an interview with a relatively high-profile VTuber news/gossip site and appearing to take aim at the top VTuber agency, then <em>also</em> the next most, and <em>then</em> it turning out to have involved a bunch of editorialising by the article author, but with the VTuber in question and her agency not exactly publicly claiming that the substance was untrue. It is very overtly a case where the agency and the site are appearing to deliberately attempt to stoke drama, and possibly the VTuber herself although in context it seems more like a misinformed take on her end, but one that ties in closely to her agency’s PR stance.</p>
