     Cambridge through the Centuries
          1200s  |  1300s  |  1400s  |  1500s  |  1600s  |  1700s  |  1800s  |  1900s  |  2000s 
      
    
     
      
       
        
         1209
        
       
      
      
      
      
       Groups of scholars congregate at the ancient Roman trading post of Cambridge for the purpose of study, the earliest record of the University.

        The Peasant’s Revolt. A mob led by the city’s mayor stormed Corpus Christi College, burning records and books, in protest against its rigid exaction of "candle rents", or rent charges assessed upon houses in its ownership, according to the number of wax-tapers found. A wage freeze and a new poll tax ignites the Peasant’s Revolt. Led by Wat Tyler, the peasants march on London to protest, but King Richard’s forces behead Tyler and the uprising is swiftly crushed.

        1911
       
      
      
      
      
       Ludwig Wittgenstein arrives in Cambridge from Vienna to study philosophy with Russell. The work of the two men, with Moore, transforms philosophy during the first half of the 20th century and makes Cambridge the most important centre for philosophical research in the English-speaking world.
      
     
     
      
       
        1912

       George ‘Dadie’ Rylands becomes a Fellow of King’s. His career inspired generations of actors and directors including Derek Jacobi, Michael Redgrave, Daniel Massey, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn and Jonathan Miller.
      
     
     
      
       
        1929
       
      
      
      
      
       Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, Professor of Biochemistry, receives his Nobel prize for Physiology and Medicine for discovering vitamins. It was his work which gave rise to the study of a new subject, biochemistry, and inspired Sir William Dunn’s trustees to endow the now world famous Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry.
      
     
     
      
       
        1932
       
      
      
      
      
       The atom is split for the first time. The work, giving birth to the study of nuclear physics, is carried out by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, under the direction of Ernest Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory. Their Nobel prize for Physics is awarded in 1951.

        The Peasant’s Revolt. A mob led by the city’s mayor stormed Corpus Christi College, burning records and books, in protest against its rigid exaction of "candle rents", or rent charges assessed upon houses in its ownership, according to the number of wax-tapers found. A wage freeze and a new poll tax ignites the Peasant’s Revolt. Led by Wat Tyler, the peasants march on London to protest, but King Richard’s forces behead Tyler and the uprising is swiftly crushed.

     Cambridge through the Centuries
          1200s  |  1300s  |  1400s  |  1500s  |  1600s  |  1700s  |  1800s  |  1900s  |  2000s 
      
    
     
      
       
        
         1209
        
       
      
      
      
      
       Groups of scholars congregate at the ancient Roman trading post of Cambridge for the purpose of study, the earliest record of the University.
      
     
     
      
       
        1284
       
      
      
      
      
       Peterhouse, the first college at Cambridge, is founded by the Bishop of Ely.
      
     
     
      
       
        
         1326
        
       
      
      
      
      
       Clare College is founded.
      
     
     
      
       
        1347
       
      
      
      
      
       Mary, Countess of Pembroke, founds Pembroke College.

        The Peasant’s Revolt. A mob led by the city’s mayor stormed Corpus Christi College, burning records and books, in protest against its rigid exaction of "candle rents", or rent charges assessed upon houses in its ownership, according to the number of wax-tapers found. A wage freeze and a new poll tax ignites the Peasant’s Revolt. Led by Wat Tyler, the peasants march on London to protest, but King Richard’s forces behead Tyler and the uprising is swiftly crushed.

The founding charter of King’s was written by John Broke (documented 1443-1450) clerk of the chancery, and illuminated by the London artist William Abell (documented 1450-d.1474).

        1533

        1687

       Bertrand Russell, Fellow of Trinity, publishes ‘Principles of Mathematics’, the same year as G.E. Moore publishes his influential ‘Principia Ethica’. In 1913, Russell and A.N. Whitehead publish the even more influential `Principia Mathematica’. It is another four decades before Russell collects his Nobel prize for Literature.
      
     
     
      
       
        1906

        1911
       
      
      
      
      
       Ludwig Wittgenstein arrives in Cambridge from Vienna to study philosophy with Russell. The work of the two men, with Moore, transforms philosophy during the first half of the 20th century and makes Cambridge the most important centre for philosophical research in the English-speaking world.
      
     
     
      
       
        1912

        1929
       
      
      
      
      
       Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, Professor of Biochemistry, receives his Nobel prize for Physiology and Medicine for discovering vitamins. It was his work which gave rise to the study of a new subject, biochemistry, and inspired Sir William Dunn’s trustees to endow the now world famous Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry.
      
     
     
      
       
        1932
       
      
      
      
      
       The atom is split for the first time. The work, giving birth to the study of nuclear physics, is carried out by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, under the direction of Ernest Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory. Their Nobel prize for Physics is awarded in 1951.

     Cambridge through the Centuries
          1200s  |  1300s  |  1400s  |  1500s  |  1600s  |  1700s  |  1800s  |  1900s  |  2000s 
      
    
     
      
       
        
         1209
        
       
      
      
      
      
       Groups of scholars congregate at the ancient Roman trading post of Cambridge for the purpose of study, the earliest record of the University.
      
     
     
      
       
        1284
       
      
      
      
      
       Peterhouse, the first college at Cambridge, is founded by the Bishop of Ely.
      
     
     
      
       
        
         1326

        The Peasant’s Revolt. A mob led by the city’s mayor stormed Corpus Christi College, burning records and books, in protest against its rigid exaction of "candle rents", or rent charges assessed upon houses in its ownership, according to the number of wax-tapers found. A wage freeze and a new poll tax ignites the Peasant’s Revolt. Led by Wat Tyler, the peasants march on London to protest, but King Richard’s forces behead Tyler and the uprising is swiftly crushed.

        1533

        1929
       
      
      
      
      
       Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, Professor of Biochemistry, receives his Nobel prize for Physiology and Medicine for discovering vitamins. It was his work which gave rise to the study of a new subject, biochemistry, and inspired Sir William Dunn’s trustees to endow the now world famous Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry.
      
     
     
      
       
        1932
       
      
      
      
      
       The atom is split for the first time. The work, giving birth to the study of nuclear physics, is carried out by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, under the direction of Ernest Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory. Their Nobel prize for Physics is awarded in 1951.

        The Peasant’s Revolt. A mob led by the city’s mayor stormed Corpus Christi College, burning records and books, in protest against its rigid exaction of "candle rents", or rent charges assessed upon houses in its ownership, according to the number of wax-tapers found. A wage freeze and a new poll tax ignites the Peasant’s Revolt. Led by Wat Tyler, the peasants march on London to protest, but King Richard’s forces behead Tyler and the uprising is swiftly crushed.
