<p>My Contrived Conspiracy Conjecture a few months ago was that this had to do with going public. Merging it into the profitable main branch would mean that it’d be harder for shareholders to pressure Anycolor into dropping the ID members because they’d now be part of the general Nijisanji group rather than a self-contained branch. Whether that’s to stave off potential nationalistic types or because ID was operating at or near a loss, I don’t know; and I also came up with this before a lot of the documents about Anycolor’s business figures started coming out.</p>

She turned her attention to Russian history in 2012, editing existing articles on Czar Alexander I of Russia. From then on, she spread fabricated stories throughout Chinese Wikipedia’s coverage of Russian history. She used a real, and often bloody, rivalry between the two early Slavic states as a basis for an elaborate fiction, mixing research with fantasy.</p>

Its rich economy made it an important resource to the princes of Tver, but also attracted the powerful rulers of Muscovy (Moscow), who attempted to take the mine in a series of battles that took turn across the land of what is now Russia from 1305 to 1485. “After the fall of the Principality of Tver, it continued to be mined by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and its successor regime until the mine was closed in the mid-18th century due to being exhausted,” the entry (wikipedia article) said.</p>

<p>—– <strong>599.1</strong> —–2022-07-06 21:49:15+08:00:</p>

<p>More can of course be said for other periods, but I discuss the Qing context (drawing primarily from Matthew Mosca’s excellent <em>From Frontier Policy to Foreign Policy</em>) in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qlfr99/how_was_the_relationship_between_qing_china_and/hj65yek/">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>—– <strong>599.2</strong> —–2022-07-07 02:45:33+08:00:</p>

<p>A great answer, but I do wish to note a little quibble:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>before which the Tibetans were vassals who rarely had to interact with Beijing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only imperial Chinese states which had meaningful control over Tibet were the Mongol Yuan between 1244 and 1354 and the Manchu Qing from ca. 1720 to 1911, during which their rule in the region was quite extensive. However, for basically the rest of Tibetan history, the Chinese presence in Tibet was extremely ephemeral, and nationalist Chinese narratives of a historic suzerainty over Tibet are nonsensical at best.</p>

<p>—– <strong>599.3</strong> —–2022-07-07 02:49:26+08:00:</p>

<p>The other, more immediate claim relates to Qing rule, which was much more stable and arguably more extensive than the Mongols’ was, but yep, it’s similarly based on the notion that the modern Chinese nation-state derives its territorial bounds from the conquests of peoples who have only retroactively been claimed into that nation-state for the last hundred years or so.</p>

<p>—– <strong>599.4</strong> —–2022-07-07 19:32:07+08:00:</p>

<p>Well, there’s two responses to this:</p>

<p>The first is that the Western examples you cite are no less problematic in a purely historiographical sense.</p>

<p>The second is that there is a lot of vacillation in Chinese historical orthodoxy over whether to regard ‘alien’ regimes as meaningfully ‘Chinese’ or not. While the notion of ‘Sinicisation’ has been used to argue that Chinese culture overpowers foreign rulers and absorbs them into the Chinese cultural sphere, at the same time there can be the implicit legitimacy of regimes that, when you look at hard facts, were ethnocentric in favour of minorities. Moreover, said minorities’ inclusion in the modern Chinese nation was not exactly done with those minorities’ consent, as the post-Qing independence of Tibet and Mongolia shows. So in the Chinese case there is a strong layer of ‘we claim X ethnic groups into our nation, but as subsumed into a cultural package dominated by the Han Chinese who form the core of said nation.’</p>

<p>There’s a whole thread on it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/poxb2h/tomatoanus_cutting_all_ties_with_karl_jobst/">here</a> on r/speedrun. Jobst managed to cover his trail by deleting a lot of the evidence and issuing a response video that only went after the wilder claims and not the underlying substance, but even the evidence that remains shows he’s been metaphorically in bed with neo-Nazis for years.</p>

<p>EDIT: I mean also, Jobst openly paraded the fact that Notch was providing his legal fees in a suit with Billy Mitchell (Notch, if anyone wasn’t already aware, is an antifeminist, transphobe, and homophobe, once tweeted about white pride, and openly supported QAnon), and also made a video attempting to exonerate Dream’s Minecraft speedrun cheating, so to be frank, he’s likely exhausted any scrap of credibility he had.</p>

<p>Sad but probably true. Turns out if you were to present speedrunners with a neonazi vs someone who includes a supportive message about mental health in every video, they prefer the neonazi.</p>

<p>—– <strong>601.4</strong> —–2022-07-13 23:19:19+08:00:</p>

<p>Most of the evidence that came out is summarised <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/poxb2h/tomatoanus_cutting_all_ties_with_karl_jobst/">here</a> on r/speedrun.</p>

<p>—– <strong>601.5</strong> —–2022-07-15 02:18:08+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They could have Cathayan colonies there fighting over the lands with beastmen and the lizardmen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, because depicting Fantasy!Chinese imperialism in Fantasy!India and Fantasy!Southeast Asia would go over <em>so</em> well…</p>

<p>—– <strong>601.6</strong> —–2022-07-15 03:02:38+08:00:</p>

<p>I mean, I never said I approved of the rest of the setting either… <em>looking</em> <strong><em>especially</em></strong> <em>hard at that Empire conquistador campaign…</em></p>

<p>—– <strong>601.7</strong> —–2022-07-16 00:46:10+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) is impossible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like something a ghost would say.</p>

<p>—– <strong>601.8</strong> —–2022-07-19 09:30:12+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EDIT: Omega’s back!
 I’m SURE people on Twitter and Reddit are gonna have a normal one about this (they won’t). Also where’s the milk?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won’t lie… I have always found it amusing that Hololive, perhaps inadvertently, created its own VTweeter.</p>
