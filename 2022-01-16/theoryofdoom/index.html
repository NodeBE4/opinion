<p>I am disinclined to undertake a broader review of his work and impact here, but I’ll note the following:  Mearsheimer held that title at one point, but has since lost it.  There are some of his earlier books I think are worth reading (e.g., The Tragedy of Great Power Politics) and at least one of his later books are worth reading too (e.g., The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities).</p>

<p>But as soon as he’s charged with analyzing specific matters, he’s off the rails.  Ukraine is clear evidence of the same. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4&amp;ab_channel=TheUniversityofChicago">Mearsheimer’s oft-repeated West-blaming argument for Ukraine</a> is at once <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/eastern-europe-caucasus/2014-10-17/faulty-powers">wrong in fact and theory</a>.

<p>Agree with this.  The Jack Reacher books are among the worst in the mass market action/thriller category.   Really, anything that Lee Child wrote is an excellent example of what <em>not</em> to do as an author.  The same goes goes for Ben Coes, Brad Taylor and Brad Meltzer, and the universe of everything they’ve published.</p>

<p>Examples of how to do that right include, but are not limited to, the novels written by: Vince Flynn, Jack Carr and Brad Thor.  Kyle Mills’ continuation of the Mitch Rapp series are good, but the last one was a flop in my view.  The original Vince Flynn novels were better.</p>

<p>—– <strong>28.1</strong> —–2022-01-13 13:24:57+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I keep seeing how the unvaxxed have to get tested once a week, yet the vaxxed don’t require it. If both can spread it the same why is this happening?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “weekly testing” regimes don’t work the same way as vaccination, and aren’t intended for the same purposes.  Weekly testing requirements are geared more towards public health considerations than individual-level effort to “stop the spread.”</p>

<p>Here are the basic ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, weekly testing is burdensome to unvaccinated individuals.  It’s less burdensome to simply get vaccinated.  That’s one type of incentive to encourage vaccination.  This is straightforward and obvious, though a lot of people are unwilling to just come out and state it.  The burdens associated with weekly testing regimes aren’t a bug, they’re a feature.  All part of the game theory of public health.</li>
  <li>Second, weekly testing the unvaccinated results provide information about probability of infection.  If you are unvaccinated and infected, you are more likely to require medical treatment than if you are vaccinated and infected.  Based on that idea, positives among unvaccinated populations allow relevant decision makers to anticipate future demands on public resources and respond accordingly.  Doing so is one way to mitigate the burdens associated with people who are not vaccinated being hospitalized.</li>
  <li>Third, weekly testing does not necessarily provide those benefits for vaccinated populations.  If you are vaccinated, you are less likely to be hospitalized and therefore less likely to impose demands on public resources.  This is why there is less utility associated with imposing similar requirements on vaccinated populations.</li>
  <li>Fourth, the benefits of weekly testing vaccinated populations are not currently thought to outweigh the harms:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>While it is true that vaccinated persons can and do become hospitalized, they do so at lower rates than unvaccinated persons.</li>
  <li>Likewise, there are risks to being able to properly assess vaccine efficacy and other metrics <a href="https://archive.fo/e68hz">associated with over-testing vaccinated persons who lack infection symptoms</a>.</li>
  <li>And obviously, if the goal is to encourage vaccination, subjecting vaccinated populations to the same testing requirements as unvaccinated populations is counterproductive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vaccines, on the other hand, are about two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For individuals, the idea behind the mRNA vaccines is to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03738-2">train your immune system to combat infection</a>.  So by vaccinating, you’re reducing the probability of initial — and particularly, symptomatic — infection in a subject and increasing odds of survival following infection and hospitalization.</li>
  <li>From a public health perspective, the idea behind vaccines is that you’re taking someone out of the pool of persons likely to be infected or become symptomatically infected or likely to impose demands on public resources due to hospitalization, following infection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given those points, it should come as no surprise that vaccines reduce the spread of COVID infection to others in a number of ways.  Others have linked some papers tending to show that, though it’s a messy picture trying to prove and the data ecosystem on that point is really messy — which I suspect is why I think you had trouble finding resources relating to reduced community transmission.</p>

<p>Some speculate that this will be less the case with omicron.  For example, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/01/12/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-78/">Fauci, at today’s white house press briefing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You reduce the duration of illness.  You reduce, to some extent, infectivity and transmission.  And importantly, particularly as we’re dealing with this extraordinary situation with Omicron, you minimize the stress on the healthcare system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though I think it’s too early to say.  We’ll see.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We literally hire the worst emotionally fragile people to do this job. Their first instinct is to harm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tend to agree, for the United States at least.  There, the hires tend to comprise a lot of mid- to late-20’s or early 30’s military washouts with latent, undiagnosed and untreated PTSD.  Once they’re hired, the culture of most departments reinforces bad behavior and institutional pathologies, where cops see themselves as “the thin blue line” between order and chaos — under a state of constant siege.  It’s that siege mentality that makes cops instinctively react with harm, because they perceive everything around them as a threat.  Add to that the War on Terror’s technological leftovers and you’ve got a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>That’s what I see in the difference between the dog’s instincts and the cop’s instincts here.  Typically police dogs respond to their handler’s reactions, tone and body language.  But the dog is making decisions based on what it sees and what it doesn’t see is a threat.  Some here have speculated that the cop didn’t perceive the guy as a threat because of how he handled the dog, though I disagree.  Cops (that are not canines) see everyone as threats, always.  Dogs on the other hand do not.  This dog is more psychologically balanced than the cop.</p>

<p>The sad part is that it doesn’t have to be this way.  There are countries where the police force is professional, competent, highly trained and maintain a culture of accountability.  For example, in Germany the kinds of problems with police departments simply do not exist like they do in America.  Even better situation in Switzerland, where this kind of thing simply does not happen.</p>

<p>Ways to be evil don’t typically occur to good people.  Medical billing fraud is common, lucrative and very difficult to identify.  But here’s something to keep in mind: whenever the government allocates a whole bunch of money for essentially anything, this kind of thing will follow.  It’s not limited to medicine, either.  It happens to the extent government pays for anything.  From ambulance services, to construction contracts to the earned income tax credit.</p>

<p>Here’s the good news: they’ll get their due.  The Illinois attorney general really is interested in putting the screws to these shithole people and he’s already put points on the board.</p>

<p>Not the right strategy.  If you want to actually change things, file a grievance with Michigan State Judicial Commission:</p>
