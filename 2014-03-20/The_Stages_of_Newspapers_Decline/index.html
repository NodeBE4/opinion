     The Stages of Newspapers’ Decline

    The second-most common objection to  FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average  was along these lines:

    That’s very true; those same people – and there are a lot of them – didn’t read the news in a newspaper either. Instead they read the Style section, or Sports, the comics or Dear Abby. It doesn’t really matter though – the same principle of the best killing the average still applies. What is Buzzfeed if not funnies for grownups?
    Even that, though, undersells what is happening: it’s not only that the Internet lets you find the 
    objectively
    best content, but that it also lets you find the 
    subjectively
    best content based on 
    your
    interests.
    To return to the same  Columbia Journalism Review article  I quoted in the last post:
    
      But the control of distribution that was so profitable IRL hasn’t ended online. It just moved, passing from newspapers, TV stations, and the post office to the companies in Andreessen’s portfolio, which happen to have zero cost of content: Google, Facebook, and Twitter (plus the ISPs).
      Google’s gross profit margins were 57 percent last year and Facebook’s were 76 percent, which is just bananas. Gannett at the peak of its labor-cutting and advertiser-milking could never have dreamed of those kinds of margins.
      Google has 67 percent of the search market. It alone hauls in 41 percent of all online advertising in the entire country.
    
    And why shouldn’t it? The entire premise of Google is that it finds exactly what I am looking for. The  potential of Twitter  is that it can be perfectly tailored to my interests. A newspaper designed to appeal to the largest cross-section of people with a bundle that includes everything from international news to the horoscope is much, much less likely to have 
    exactly
    what I’m looking for, and only a small percentage of what it has will be close.
    It’s interesting to map the demise of newspapers against the evolution of communication on the Internet:
    
      Stage 1 was simply moving offline content online. This let anyone anywhere access the 
     objectively
     best, like the New York Times. This decimated a lot of local newspapers, like the Wisconsin State Journal (per  my last post  )
      Stage 2 was the introduction of user-generated content broadly, and social specifically. This dramatically increased the range of content available, even as it made it easier to find content 
     subjectively
     better for any one person. This is when even the objectively best newspapers really started to feel the pain
      Stage 3 is the mobile and contextual stage, highlighted by the  rise in messaging  . This is about delivering content that is not just personalized but contextually appropriate to my specific situation. What chance does an industry based on broad reach and the idea of daily editions have?
    
    In case you’re wondering, the most-common objection to  FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average  was that I didn’t address the demise in advertising. That was intentional; while I plan on talking business models – and it’s an important topic – I think that people in the news industry are too quick to attribute their problems to ads, and too slow to understand how incompatible the Internet is with their definition of a newspaper. 
    Newspapers
    may be screwed, but we can’t start fixing 
    news
    until we understand what we’re trying to save, and what is simply a relic.

    <p>The second-most common objection to <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/fivethirtyeight-end-average/"> FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average </a> was along these lines:</p>
    <blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en">
      <p>Love 100% of <a href="https://twitter.com/stratechery"> @stratechery </a> posts but this one off: forgets to segment market. Many don't care about "quality" news <a href="http://t.co/KnSmNgZbS2"> http://t.co/KnSmNgZbS2 </a></p>
      <p>— Rich Yudhishthu (@yudhishthu) <a href="https://twitter.com/yudhishthu/statuses/445697507520045057"> March 17, 2014 </a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>That’s very true; those same people – and there are a lot of them – didn’t read the news in a newspaper either. Instead they read the Style section, or Sports, the comics or Dear Abby. It doesn’t really matter though – the same principle of the best killing the average still applies. What is Buzzfeed if not funnies for grownups?</p>
    <p>Even that, though, undersells what is happening: it’s not only that the Internet lets you find the <em>
    objectively
   </em> best content, but that it also lets you find the <em>
    subjectively
   </em> best content based on <em>
    your
   </em> interests.</p>
    <p>To return to the same <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/marc_andreessens_news-business.php?page=all"> Columbia Journalism Review article </a> I quoted in the last post:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>But the control of distribution that was so profitable IRL hasn’t ended online. It just moved, passing from newspapers, TV stations, and the post office to the companies in Andreessen’s portfolio, which happen to have zero cost of content: Google, Facebook, and Twitter (plus the ISPs).</p>
      <p>Google’s gross profit margins were 57 percent last year and Facebook’s were 76 percent, which is just bananas. Gannett at the peak of its labor-cutting and advertiser-milking could never have dreamed of those kinds of margins.</p>
      <p>Google has 67 percent of the search market. It alone hauls in 41 percent of all online advertising in the entire country.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And why shouldn’t it? The entire premise of Google is that it finds exactly what I am looking for. The <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/might-twitter-maximize-potential/"> potential of Twitter </a> is that it can be perfectly tailored to my interests. A newspaper designed to appeal to the largest cross-section of people with a bundle that includes everything from international news to the horoscope is much, much less likely to have <em>
    exactly
   </em> what I’m looking for, and only a small percentage of what it has will be close.</p>
    <p>It’s interesting to map the demise of newspapers against the evolution of communication on the Internet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stage 1 was simply moving offline content online. This let anyone anywhere access the <em>
     objectively
    </em> best, like the New York Times. This decimated a lot of local newspapers, like the Wisconsin State Journal (per <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/fivethirtyeight-end-average/"> my last post </a> )</li>
      <li>Stage 2 was the introduction of user-generated content broadly, and social specifically. This dramatically increased the range of content available, even as it made it easier to find content <em>
     subjectively
    </em> better for any one person. This is when even the objectively best newspapers really started to feel the pain</li>
      <li>Stage 3 is the mobile and contextual stage, highlighted by the <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/messaging-mobiles-killer-app/"> rise in messaging </a> . This is about delivering content that is not just personalized but contextually appropriate to my specific situation. What chance does an industry based on broad reach and the idea of daily editions have?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In case you’re wondering, the most-common objection to <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/fivethirtyeight-end-average/"> FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average </a> was that I didn’t address the demise in advertising. That was intentional; while I plan on talking business models – and it’s an important topic – I think that people in the news industry are too quick to attribute their problems to ads, and too slow to understand how incompatible the Internet is with their definition of a newspaper. <strong>
    Newspapers
   </strong> may be screwed, but we can’t start fixing <strong>
    news
   </strong> until we understand what we’re trying to save, and what is simply a relic.</p>
