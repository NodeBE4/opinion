<p>Something often tacitly ignored is the nomadic world here: notions of Chinese continuity rely heavily on eliding the point that nomadic regimes have dominated northern China several times, culminating with the Mongols establishing control over the whole thing for nearly a century.

<p>—– <strong>379.1</strong> —–2022-04-26 01:55:56+08:00:</p>

<p>So uh I guess I decided to post the thing in the previous thread after it was already off, so I’m reposting the exact same thing here.</p>

<hr />

<p>So I have no idea how far this is of interest to anybody, but the discussion around Tsunderia’s graduations and its effect on the agency’s ranking relative to other EN agencies got me interested enough to do some data entry yesterday to find out. I won’t share the full dataset here, but I did a bit of functioning and number crunching to produce <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sVVWrle">some graphs</a>.</p>

<p>To put it mildly, Tsunderia has dropped considerably within the league. To put it more extremely, Tsunderia has dropped <em>out</em> of the league. It had been a close contender with PRISM for the #2 spot in terms of total subscribers, while sitting comfortably in #3 for mean subs per member. It’s now #5 in both categories, with <em>half</em> the total and average subs of Cyberlive at #4.</p>

<p><em>That said</em>, a huge part of that is because of just how popular Miori Celesta is. At the time of her graduating, Miori accounted for a whopping <em>65%</em> of the agency’s subscribers. Even if nobody else left, that would mean a huge hit in both total and average subs. But these are also, for that same reason, quite superficial numbers: how much traffic was Miori necessarily driving to the rest of Tsunderia, given how far ahead of the others she seems to have gone?</p>

<p>Which in turn raises an interesting note about the ‘top-heaviness’ of the other agencies: Production Kawaii looks like it has a big lead over Phase-Connect, but it would end up sandwiched between Phase-Connect and Cyberlive without Nene Amano. Cyberlive without Emma would only just edge ahead of Tsunderia post-graduations. PRISM and Phase-Connect, by contrast, seem to have a more even spread, and both would stay where they are rankings-wise without their top member.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that this doesn’t contrast <em>that</em> heavily with the ‘big 3’ EN agencies (Holo/Niji/Vshojo), where some agencies have some quite extreme breakout stars, and some don’t to the same extent. HoloEN is the top-heaviest, with Gura accounting for around 30% of its total YT subscribers; VShojo is quite close with Ironmouse having a little over 25% of its Twitch followers; NijiEN is the most evenly spread with Vox accounting for only 10% of the total subscribers. On the whole, the top-heaviness trends somewhat lower than at the smaller agencies, but not by an absurd margin, and Holo and Niji would definitely fall in the middle of the pack if mixed in with the others.</p>

<p>Anyway, that was me rambling about stats for a while.</p>

<p>—– <strong>379.3</strong> —–2022-04-26 02:58:25+08:00:</p>

<p>I genuinely hadn’t clocked any prior discussion on ‘Pettan 5’ so if that’s an issue I’ve edited that out. I did also do all the stats for the big 3, although I didn’t do charts simply because the other stats are so disproportionate (though I can add those if desired). Looking at top-heaviness and mean time for all 8 agencies:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So a quick note that because I now had to account for VShojo, the way the top-heaviness %age worked was modified slightly. Total subs for each agency were calculated not as total subs across all platforms, but the total of each individual member’s higher sub counts between YT and Twitch. Basically, what I did was presume – not necessarily accurately, but well enough – that for instance most of Nyanners’ 795k Twitch followers overlap with her 1.4m YT subscribers, while Ironmouse’s 1.16m Twitch followers include most of her 685k YT subscribers. So I took the higher sub count, whichever platform it was, instead of just totalling YT+Twitch. If I had gone for all platforms rather than taking the higher of each, Ironmouse would be 22.2% of VShojo’s total subs.</p>

<p>—– <strong>379.4</strong> —–2022-04-26 03:32:22+08:00:</p>

<p>In the kouhai/kohai case, it’s more complicated because it is a long vowel, so most common Romanisations render it with a diacritic, so either kōhai (Hepburn) or kôhai (Kunrei/Nihon-shiki). It would be technically incorrect to render it <em>kohai</em> without such a mark, hence why it’s not entirely uncommon to write it out as <em>kouhai</em> if you can’t easily produce a diacritic; it also matches the Japanese orthography more closely.</p>

<p>—– <strong>379.5</strong> —–2022-04-26 11:10:35+08:00:</p>

<p>On the matter of top-heaviness, I came up with it as a quick and dirty way to look at the relative sub counts between the top member and the rest, given that with one exception (NijiEN), all of them have between 7 and 12 members which is a comfortably narrow range. I have been thinking of instead taking the ratio of the top member’s subs to the agency mean, or even the mean of everyone <em>except</em> the top, which should account better for agency size. (EDIT: <a href="https://imgur.com/DV2bmJ0">I also graphed those</a>.)</p>

<p>As for VShojo numbers, as noted there are VShojo members with higher Youtube subscribers than Twitch followers – Nyanners and Melody in particular – hence the ‘take the higher’ approach.</p>

<p>As for tabled numbers I can do that; would probably be easier to take a screencap of my table and post an imgur link so <a href="https://imgur.com/yp1INNU">I’ve done that</a>.</p>

<p>—– <strong>379.6</strong> —–2022-04-26 19:10:11+08:00:</p>

<p>Zeta definitely seems very comfortable with preferring English over Bahasa Indonesia as her main on-stream language, while still very much using both. Similar to Reine in that regard, at least from my experience.</p>

<p>—– <strong>379.7</strong> —–2022-04-27 10:47:34+08:00:</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken – but I might be – UP used to run /vt/-takes, so if that was banned then the UP account might have also been banned for essentially ban evading.</p>

<p>—– <strong>379.8</strong> —–2022-04-27 14:07:11+08:00:</p>

<p>Yes, but that doesn’t mean Twitter would necessarily immediately ban all connected accounts. Most sites operate on a largely reactive moderation approach (i.e. there isn’t a problem until someone flags it) so it’s entirely possible for there to be a considerable lag between one account being banned and another by the same user.</p>

<p>—– <strong>379.11</strong> —–2022-04-30 11:42:47+08:00:</p>

<p>I wrote my long-form take on this over on HobbyDrama yesterday <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uawlfn/hobby_scuffles_week_of_april_25_2022/i6mwzmt/">(see here)</a>, but to state it in brief here, Anycolor going public almost certainly seems like the reason they shuttered Yumenographia last year and then did the ID/KR merger. The announcement shutting down Yumenographia didn’t say it wasn’t growing, just that it wasn’t growing at the <em>rate</em> hoped for, which is very much the sort of thing that public shareholders would care about. My suspicion is that a similar situation existed for ID/KR, that they were not necessarily unprofitable but rather not growing at hoped for rates. So, the best-case scenario if Anycolor was planning to go public whatever the case, was to essentially do some creative accounting by folding the ID and KR branches and subsuming their numbers under the umbrella of the main agency, allowing them to keep the members at the expense of essentially capping any future expansion in those regions, at least in the medium term.</p>

<p>As someone who really isn’t a Niji watcher, I don’t know that my opinion is worth much, but what I’m curious about is where the extra money on the agency side might be going. It seems like with both Yumenographia and the non-CN/EN branches now effectively shuttered, Anycolor has already divested itself of its riskier ventures; does this mean they’re mainly just going to keep pushing EN and/or JP for the foreseeable future?</p>

There’s really not much to say about OmegaAlpha, it was an attempt to do an A-chan for EN that didn’t go over brilliantly, plus A-chan also tweets in English now so there just wasn’t the need anymore. Who knows, maybe they’ll come back, but I think everyone is willing to just quietly let it slide and occasionally bring it up as a joke, at least as far as the agency and the, er, less perpetually online part of the fanbase are concerned.</p>

<p>The situation seems a little complex. From what I can tell, the report doesn’t distinguish between the branches at all in terms of revenues and expenditures, so it’s probably less that they’re trying to conceal figures for the sake of the IPO (which evidently they can do without the merger), but rather that in the long term, they don’t have to potentially account for those branches in the event a more detailed breakdown is required.</p>

<p>EDIT: The other thing to add, WRT Yumenographia, is that while it may still be accounted for somewhere in the report, the key thing is not that these were changes made for the immediate sake of the IPO but the long-term situation of going public, and the merger being timed for the beginning of the financial year would seem to suggest that.</p>

<p>This is pure speculation on my part, but I wonder if the slowdown on Nijisanji’s side in terms of JP debuts (weren’t there something like 5 in 2021 compared to dozens in previous years?) is due to some kind of perception that they’ve hit a saturation point, and new members are simply drawing on the same audience rather than bringing in new people? It’d explain what seems to have been a really hard pivot to EN in recent months.</p>

<p>The question hanging over it for me as well is how long they can necessarily maintain VR while also doing EN. That’s not to say it’s impossible, but it feels like a matter of time before they go from treading on eggshells to treading on glass.</p>

<p>No it’s fine! In terms of IRL activities in relation to Dokomi in particular, Kiara straight up said before she was going, and again after, that she was there in person. It’s always possible to talk about IRL activities without revealing one’s IRL identity, after all. Having someone in person at the event in general, but still doing the meetup digitally, won’t be a major issue. It is not, to my knowledge, explicitly known to the general public what the contractual terms are regarding revealing IRL identities, but in general it is prohibited for a Hololive talent to knowingly and deliberately reveal their IRL identity from their Hololive channel or vice versa, but normal accidental slip-ups have always been tolerated.</p>

<p>—– <strong>385.1</strong> —–2022-04-27 18:18:29+08:00:</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer link! That said, I think the issue of Alexander and Cyrus is more complicated than just what I write in that answer, and I don’t want to inadvertently give off the impression that Alexander had no affinity whatever for Cyrus. As I note in that answer, the notion that Alexander read the <em>Cyropaedia</em> is a tempting but unprovable one: we don’t know the curriculum of Alexander’s education in general, and we don’t have anything more than circumstantial evidence to suggest that the <em>Cyropaedia</em> might have been part of it. However, the <em>Cyropaedia</em> is also notable as nevertheless the only work in the Xenophontic corpus which we can be reasonably sure Alexander had at least indirect exposure to, as Antigonos’ brother Marsyas had been writing an <em>Education of Alexander</em> modelled on the <em>Cyropaedia</em> when on campaign with Alexander up to 331, and as a member of Alexander’s extended circle of friends would almost certainly have introduced him to at least some elements of the <em>Cyropaedia</em> as a result. All this to say that we cannot say with any degree of certainty whether Alexander was particularly aware of Cyrus as depicted by Xenophon.</p>

<p>That is, however, a different matter from whether Alexander recognised Cyrus regardless, based on other texts or even just word of mouth. There are three episodes that appear in the major sources that suggest that while Alexander didn’t necessarily overtly model himself on Cyrus, he did nevertheless recognise him as a notable predecessor:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Alexander’s encounter with the Ariaspians (aka Euergetes) in 329; (Arr. 3.27.4-5; Diod. 17.81; Curt. 3.7.1-3)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alexander’s decision to retreat from India via Gedrosia in 326; (Arr. <em>Anabasis</em> 6.24.3)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alexander’s re-dedication of the tomb of Cyrus at Pasargadae in winter 325/4. (Arr. 6.29.4-11; Plut. <em>Alexander</em> 69.1-5; Curt. 10.1.30-35, Strabo 15.3.7)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the Ariaspian case, all three of the cited sources concur very closely. All of them go as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After leaving Drangiana, Alexander marched into the lands of the Ariaspians.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The origin of the Ariaspians’ alternate name, the ‘Benefactors’ (<em>Euergetes</em>) is explained – they had supplied Cyrus’ army at a time when it was in desperate need of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alexander, aware of the services that the Ariaspians had rendered Cyrus, offered gifts to them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where there is some divergence is on this last point: Arrian has it that he was also impressed by their system of government, ‘allowed them their freedom’, and offered to enlarge the Ariaspians’ territory; Diodoros has it that the Ariaspians ‘received him kindly’ and were given gifts in return; and Curtius has it that Alexander issued ‘a large financial reward for their outstanding loyalty to Cyrus’, and appointed a Persian governor over them. That this particular episode appears in broadly similar form in all three sources, straddling the official-Vulgate divide, seems reason enough to believe that it is, in the broad strokes, true. While they diverge on the matter of what precisely Alexander did, that, paradoxically, may serve to elevate its veracity by suggesting that the event was narrated by more than one primary source, and that each historian drew on a somewhat different combination. That said, I think the background detail given by Diodoros adds an important layer of nuance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saved from utter despair, then, Cyrus gave them exemption from taxation and other marks of honour, and abolishing their former appellation, named them Benefactors. (Diod. 17.81.1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this in mind, Alexander’s favour towards the Ariaspians need not be interpreted as a specific attempt to honour Cyrus, but part of a more general policy of maintaining the Achaemenid status quo towards peoples who cooperated with the Macedonian conquest. That said, I personally would argue that the sources’ claim that Alexander intentionally emulated Cyrus holds some water.</p>

<p>Only Arrian links Alexander’s Indian campaign with Cyrus, and makes the claim that his decision to retreat through Gedrosia was an attempt to succeed where Semiramis and Cyrus had failed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Semiramis had come this way on her forced retreat from India, but the locals said that even she had only made it through with twenty survivors of her army, and Cyrus the son of Cambyses likewise with only seven. Cyrus had come to these parts on his way to invade India, but he lost most of his army to the impossible conditions of this desert route before he could get there. The consensus is that these stories inspired in Alexander a desire to outdo Cyrus and Semiramis, and Nearchus says that he took this route both for that reason and also to keep close enough to the fleet to provide it with essential supplies. (<em>Anabasis of Alexander</em> 6.24.3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with this claim is twofold: firstly, it is not corroborated by the other narrative sources; secondly, Arrian, in his later work the <em>Indika</em>, categorically denies that either Semiramis or Cyrus actually invaded India.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Semiramis the Assyrian queen did attempt an expedition against India, but died before she could give effect to her plans. It was only Alexander who did actually invade India. (<em>Indika</em> 5.7)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Indians say that Dionysus was fifteen generations earlier than Heracles, and that no one else had made a military invasion of India, not even Cyrus the son of Cambyses, though he had campaigned against the Scythians and was generally the most expansionist of the Asian kings. But then Alexander had come and conquered every country he invaded by force of arms: he would have gone on to conquer the entire world, if his army had been willing. (<em>Indika</em> 9.10-11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this doesn’t disprove that Alexander may have <em>believed</em> such stories, the generally confused way Arrian discusses Cyrus in relation to India and Gedrosia nevertheless casts doubt on the claim at <em>Anabasis</em> 6.24 that Alexander was trying to outdo him.</p>

<p>The visit to the tomb of Cyrus is the most substantial episode and the one that most unambiguously suggests a genuine admiration of Cyrus on Alexander’s part. There are essentially three versions of this: the ‘official’ version of Aristoboulos, relayed via Arrian, Plutarch, and Strabo; a variation by Onesikritos, preserved also by Strabo; and Curtius’ version, which is tied in with his narrative of Alexander and the eunuch Bagoas.</p>

<p>Aristoboulos claims, somewhat out of sequence, that Alexander had visited Cyrus’ tomb the first time he was in Pasargadae and found it richly decorated (or rather Aristoboulos himself did, as he was sent in to inspect it beforehand), but on his return he discovered it had been looted. Plutarch alone has Arrian actually finding and executing a culprit, a Macedonian named Polymachos; Arrian has him torturing the Magi responsible for guarding the tomb but ultimately failing to catch anyone; Strabo mentions nothing on this count. All three concur that the tomb was supposed to have had a Persian inscription to the effect of: ‘Visitor, I am Cyrus son of Cambyses. I created the Persian Empire and was King of Asia. Do not therefore grudge me my monument.’ However, only Plutarch and Strabo say that Alexander ordered a Greek version of the inscription to be added underneath. As noted, Strabo also preserves an alternate narrative by Onesikritos, who claims that there was a multilingual inscription all along that read ‘Here I lie, Cyrus, king of kings’. Arrian also relays that Aristoboulos was ordered to restore the tomb as far as possible.</p>

<p>Curtius’ version is a little more complicated because it is integral to Alexander’s involvement with the rather shadowy figure of Bagoas, whom no other sources mention but who, in Curtius’ narrative, plays a significant role early in Book 10 by leveraging his status as Alexander’s lover to arrange the execution of the Persian nobleman Orxines. Orxines’ execution by Alexander definitely happened, but this was, according to Arrian, due to his embezzling funds during Alexander’s Indian campaign. In Curtius’ version, Bagoas entered Cyrus’ already-looted tomb with Alexander, and convinced Alexander that Orxines was responsible, leading to the latter’s execution. Unverifiable as most of the Bagoas story is, it is <em>interesting</em> that at least one of the other three sources seems to also devote space to dispelling the rumour, more specifically Strabo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…on a later visit the place had been robbed and everything had been carried off except the couch and the coffin, which had only been broken to pieces, and that the robbers had removed the corpse to another place, a fact which plainly proved that it was an act of plunderers, not of the satrap, since they left behind only what could not easily be carried off; and that the robbery took place even though the tomb was surrounded by a guard of Magi, who received for their maintenance a sheep every day and a horse every month.​ (Strabo 15.3.7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This grants some legitimacy to Curtius’ account, at least in my view, as it suggests that Strabo was likely to have been aware of a version of the story in which Orxines was suspected of involvement in the looting, and, given he was writing before Curtius was, it suggests that Curtius likely drew on the same version rather than completely fabricating the event from thin air, even if he integrated it into the more fantastical Bagoas story.</p>

<p>But that part is largely beside the point. What really matters is that while yes, Alexander could merely have been indignant over the desecration, he was clearly interested in the tomb beforehand. Where the Aristoboulos and Curtius versions differ is simply in terms of the timeframe: Aristoboulos claims that he had already visited the tomb once in 330, while Curtius suggests that he did not enter it until his second visit to Pasargadae in 324. In both versions, he made his first visit before being made aware of the looting, which is enough to suggest a genuine interest in Cyrus on some level. Just far from outright idolisation.</p>

<p>—– <strong>392.1</strong> —–2022-04-29 12:04:47+08:00:</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<p>It’s a mix of issues relating to how China has been dealing with the Omicron variant. I think there are a few headers worth stressing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The extremes of some of the measures involved are not entirely new.</strong> If you remember doors being welded shut in Wuhan in 2020, then doors being bolted from the outside in Shanghai in 2022 should not be unfamiliar. The PRC (People’s Republic of China) has adopted what it terms a ‘zero-Covid strategy’, where the aim is to completely eradicate the virus within Chinese borders rather than to ‘live with the virus’ as many Western countries have opted for; it has also entailed doing so as rapidly and immediately as possible through harsh measures up to and including completely restraining personal mobility, rather than through lower-intensity measures such as limitations on group gatherings (which was what Hong Kong did this year instead).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The overall effectiveness of the lockdowns, purely from the perspective of limiting cases and deaths, does not seem to be in question.</strong> After a series of local lockdowns beginning on 16 February, Shenzhen eventually locked down as a whole for a week 14 March to 21 March, and subsequently reopened, having had a total of 643 cases and zero deaths out of 12.5 million people. In Hong Kong on the other hand, social distancing had been in effect from late January to late April, and the city ended up with some 1.2 million confirmed cases and nearly 9300 deaths out of a population of some 7.5 million; asymptomatic and unreported cases may put that number at anywhere between 3 and 5 million by pessimistic estimates. That is to say, Shenzhen had one <em>case</em> for every 15 <em>deaths</em> in Hong Kong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>However, Omicron is making it increasingly troublesome.</strong> As alluded to, these have been increasingly long lockdown periods simply due to how Omicron slips so easily through the cracks. Shanghai has been particularly infamous on this count in having its one-week lockdown stretch out to over a month; Xi’an was locked down for over one and a half months from early December to late January; Shenzhen got off easy by only really having to deal with the harsher measures for about a month or so. There has also been concern over the costs of lockdowns relative to the aforementioned efficacy: an unverified post on Shenzhen social media that gained some traction claimed that the hard lockdown of 14-21 March cost 60 billion RMB (around 9.5 billion US dollars), for an average cost of around 15.7 million USD per case uncovered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>This is not being micromanaged particularly hard from Beijing.</strong> Simply put, the PRC’s central government is more a reactive than a proactive force when it comes to the enforcement of its directives. The ‘zero-covid strategy’ is less a coherent policy and more a mantra, a target that local and regional jurisdictions are expected to pursue on their own. In Xi’an for instance, one city district got locked down early, was forced to open by city-level authorities, and then got locked down again two days later when city authorities ordered a citywide lockdown. This is also why provision for those under lockdown has been so uneven, with similar stories having come out of Xi’an, Shenzhen, and Shanghai: the availability of food and necessities has been largely contingent on the effectiveness and/or beneficence of each individual locale’s party officials in terms of organising logistics. In most cases, officials at a low level in the chain will act on their own initiative in an attempt to fulfil the general terms of the central directive, but are also aware of the risk of censure from up the chain if they are deemed as acting too quickly or too slowly. So some will go all out and do mad things like weld doors shut to seem like they’re really doing a lot, honest! And others will fail to make advance preparations for a sudden uptick of cases and leave their constituents hungry. Direct central intervention is more the exception than the rule; most officials along the chain are acting in response to their <em>perceived</em> notions of what the expectations at the centre are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The surveillance apparatus has played a significant part in the COVID strategy so far, but the full implications of that are open to question.</strong> Without going too far on this point here, a relatively comprehensive health status app was made mandatory for use which tracks your most recent COVID test and can be used to deny entry to various places if you have either not tested recently enough or if you are supposed to be in a locked-down zone. Cities introduced ‘grid-management’ systems that allowed individual housing estates and ‘urban villages’ to be cordoned off, and where limited mobility <em>within</em> the area existed, but not beyond.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A couple of good things to read on this are:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Chri5tianGoebel/status/1478412075005362176">This thread</a> by Christian Goebel from early January discussing the decentralised nature of the Xi’an lockdown, pertinent to the Shanghai case.</p>

<p><a href="https://madeinchinajournal.com/2022/04/22/covid-among-us-viral-mobilities-in-shenzhens-moral-geography/">This article</a> by Mary Ann O’Donnell looking at the Shenzhen lockdown from a sociological perspective (a dense read, but where I got a lot of the info for the above from).</p>

<p>—– <strong>392.2</strong> —–2022-04-29 12:06:15+08:00:</p>

<p>Above I allude to the security apparatus, and I decided not to go into it too far because it’d start verging outside the impartiality expected from a top-level. I’d recommend looking at O’Donnell’s article and its sources, as there is a case to be made that the grid-management system can be understood as either a slightly softened import from Xinjiang, or as a sort of low-security tier applied to Han Chinese cities while ethnic minority regions get the high-security regime.</p>

<p>EDIT: I’m not sure if I’m being misinterpreted or anything, but all I’m saying above is that there’s been two possible interpretations of the grid management system in relation to the current Chinese surveillance state in Xinjiang: either Xinjiang has been used as a testbed for technologies being rolled out on a less intensive scale in China, or that the surveillance state in general is being ramped up everywhere, with ethnic minority regions e.g. Xinjiang disproportionately targeted.</p>

<p>—– <strong>394.1</strong> —–2022-04-29 16:26:06+08:00:</p>

<p>Alexander supposedly wore cloaks, but that doesn’t mean he supposedly wore a <em>specific</em> cloak. Now, we do know the style of that cloak: Alexander is known to have worn a purple <em>chlamys</em> as part of his royal costume, per a paraphrase of Ephippos of Olynthos preserved by the rhetoretician Athenaios (translation via Andrew Collins):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…nearly every day he wore a purple cloak, a purple tunic with a white middle, and the Macedonian <em>kausia</em> with the royal diadem. On social occasions, he put on the sandals and the <em>petasos</em> on his head, and took the <em>caduceus</em> in his hand. Often he also wore the lion’s skin and club just like Heracles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That does not suggest that he only had one particular purple cloak in his possession.</p>

<p>The provenance of Mithridates’ supposed Alexandrian cloak is an interesting tidbit in itself: it is not actually mentioned as being worn by Mithridates himself, but rather by Pompey at his triumph, per Appian (<em>The Mithridatic Wars</em> 117):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pompey himself was borne in a chariot studded with gems, wearing, it was said, a cloak of Alexander the Great, if any one can believe that. This was supposed to have been found among the possessions of Mithridates that the inhabitants of Cos had received from Cleopatra.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage alludes back to <em>The Mithridatic Wars</em> 115:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The city of Talauri Mithridates used as a storehouse of furniture. Here were found 2,000 drinking-cups made of onyx welded with gold, and many cups, wine-coolers, and drinking-horns, also ornamental couches and chairs, bridles for horses, and trappings for their breasts and shoulders, all ornamented in like manner with precious stones and gold. The quantity of this store was so great that the inventory of it occupied thirty days. Some of these things had been inherited from Darius, the son of Hystaspes; others came from the kingdom of the Ptolemies, having been deposited by Cleopatra at the island of Cos and given by the inhabitants to Mithridates; still others had been made or collected by Mithridates himself, as he was a lover of the beautiful in furniture as well as in other things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cleopatra in this case is <em>the</em> Cleopatra, i.e. Cleopatra VII. How she came to be in possession of such a cloak is never explained.</p>

<p>I would propose that there are two ways this cloak might have ended up with Pompey. The first is that the cloak was genuine. It may have been buried with Alexander when Ptolemy I purloined the funeral carriage and had his body interred at Memphis in 321 BCE, and was then transferred to Alexandria when he was reburied ca. 280; at some stage, Cleopatra decided that one of the cloaks would be gifted to or stored on Kos. The second, and I would argue far more likely scenario – as Appian’s own scepticism suggests – is that the cloak was a fake, passed off as one that had actually been worn by Alexander. But at what stage of the process this forgery occurred is unclear: It could have been that it had been done by the Ptolemies, or by Mithridates, or even by Pompey for all that we know. It would not be the first time that spurious claims had been made about certain items of Alexander’s insignia, as I discuss in the case of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/r762uj/what_happened_to_alexander_the_greats_royal/">this answer</a> on Eumenes of Kardia and Alexander’s armour and sceptre – or, more correctly, his <em>alleged</em> armour and sceptre.</p>

<p>—– <strong>394.2</strong> —–2022-05-04 11:59:56+08:00:</p>

<p>Without being too glib about it, who gives a damn? Appian suggests that nobody actually took the claim that it was Alexander’s cloak seriously. As for your suggestion that he had it when facing Caesar in Greece, I could find no reference to this in Appian, Plutarch, or Caesar, and so I don’t think it’s in any way a historical claim – not unlike what you seem to have absorbed about Mithridates wearing it before his allies. Is it possible you’ve picked up a bit from some piece of historical fiction? As far as I can tell the entire history of the alleged cloak of Mithridates is contained in a single sentence of Appian.</p>

<p>So, there are two kinds of ‘wick’s – those derived from Latin <em>vicus</em> and/or Old English <em>wīc</em>, which simply means ‘dwelling’ or sometimes ‘market’ in the OE case; and those that are cognate with Old Norse <em>vik</em> and mean ‘bay’. Alnwick and Warwick belong to the former, while Keswick and Berwick belong to the latter. However, as far as I know the latter <em>only</em> includes ‘wick’, whereas the former can also be ‘wich’, so Sandwich, Ipswich, Norwich, and Woolwich get their ‘wich’es via Latin/Old English for ‘dwelling’ rather than Old Norse for ‘bay’.</p>
