       塞林格作品新封面

       塞林格  肯定是一个奇人，其中一奇是他对自己作品的封面设计要求极为苛刻，不过他作品的（美国版）封面却多不好看，比如代表作 
     The Catcher in the Rye
     的封面，我就无论如何喜欢不起来：
          不知道是不是由于某些封面设计不佳的原因，塞先生才对封面变得苛刻起来。不过，丑陋的局面即将改变了，《卫报》  报道  ，塞林格作品将以新的系列封面重印上市：
      
        Before his death, JD Salinger’s publisher, Hamish Hamilton, worked with him to produce jackets for reissues of his books (originally planned for June, they are now due out next month). …
        Simon Prosser, publishing director, Hamish Hamilton: “There are strict rules about JD Salinger’s covers. The only copy allowed on the books, back or front, is the author name and the title. Nothing else at all: no quotes, no cover blurb, no biography. We’re not really sure why this is, but it gives you definite guidelines. Last year we decided it was probably time to re-design the covers, and we wanted a unique typeface that stood out. We commissioned Seb Lester, the highly regarded type designer, to hand-draw a font; that font, on the cover of these re-issues, is a one-off and is known in-house here at Hamish Hamilton as the ‘Salinger’.”
      
      这套新封面是  Seb Lester  设计的，相当赏心悦目：
          This collection, originally published as 
     Nine Stories
     in the US in 1953, contains some of Salinger’s greatest short fiction, including the title story (first published in the 
     New Yorker
     in 1950), in which an army sergeant recalls his meeting with a young girl before he was sent to war, and A Perfect Day for Bananafish, the first of Salinger’s stories of the Glass family.         Salinger’s third book, published in 1961, takes us deeper into the verbose, intellectual, fragile lives of the Glasses – a brilliant but brittle family of Upper West Side New Yorkers – through the doings of two of the younger members of the clan, brother and sister Franny and Zooey.
          The third instalment in the Glass family saga is narrated by Buddy, the second of the Glass brothers. His purpose is to introduce us to his older brother, Seymour, whose suicide is the subject of Salinger’s earlier story, A Perfect Day for Bananafish.
          Salinger’s most famous work, 
     The Catcher in the Rye
     has sold more than 65m copies around the world since its publication in 1951. The story of three days in the life of Holden Caulfield – whose irritable ennui and contempt for what he calls ‘phoneys’ have made him a poster-boy for adolescent disenchantment – as he drifts around New York after being expelled from school, is widely held up as a defining novel of the 20th century.
      上述新书将由企鹅集团旗下的 Hamish Hamilton 出版社出版，塞迷们可以买来收藏了。

     The Catcher in the Rye
    </em> 的封面，我就无论如何喜欢不起来：</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316769177?tag=oceintelleweb-20"> <img alt="The Catcher in the Rye" src="/img/0316769177.jpg" /> </a> <br /> 不知道是不是由于某些封面设计不佳的原因，塞先生才对封面变得苛刻起来。不过，丑陋的局面即将改变了，《卫报》 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/gallery/2010/jan/29/j-d-salinger-book-covers"> 报道 </a> ，塞林格作品将以新的系列封面重印上市：</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Before his death, JD Salinger’s publisher, Hamish Hamilton, worked with him to produce jackets for reissues of his books (originally planned for June, they are now due out next month). …</p>
        <p>Simon Prosser, publishing director, Hamish Hamilton: “There are strict rules about JD Salinger’s covers. The only copy allowed on the books, back or front, is the author name and the title. Nothing else at all: no quotes, no cover blurb, no biography. We’re not really sure why this is, but it gives you definite guidelines. Last year we decided it was probably time to re-design the covers, and we wanted a unique typeface that stood out. We commissioned Seb Lester, the highly regarded type designer, to hand-draw a font; that font, on the cover of these re-issues, is a one-off and is known in-house here at Hamish Hamilton as the ‘Salinger’.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>这套新封面是 <a href="http://www.seblester.co.uk/"> Seb Lester </a> 设计的，相当赏心悦目：</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0241950457?tag=oceintelleweb-20"> <img alt="For Esmé – with Love and Squalor" src="/img/0241950457.jpg" /> </a> <br /> This collection, originally published as <em>
     Nine Stories
    </em> in the US in 1953, contains some of Salinger’s greatest short fiction, including the title story (first published in the <em>
     New Yorker
    </em> in 1950), in which an army sergeant recalls his meeting with a young girl before he was sent to war, and A Perfect Day for Bananafish, the first of Salinger’s stories of the Glass family. <br /> <span id="more-1007"> </span> <br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0241950449?tag=oceintelleweb-20"> <img alt="Franny and Zooey" src="/img/0241950449.jpg" /> </a> <br /> Salinger’s third book, published in 1961, takes us deeper into the verbose, intellectual, fragile lives of the Glasses – a brilliant but brittle family of Upper West Side New Yorkers – through the doings of two of the younger members of the clan, brother and sister Franny and Zooey.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0241950465?tag=oceintelleweb-20"> <img alt="Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction" src="/img/0241950465.jpg" /> </a> <br /> The third instalment in the Glass family saga is narrated by Buddy, the second of the Glass brothers. His purpose is to introduce us to his older brother, Seymour, whose suicide is the subject of Salinger’s earlier story, A Perfect Day for Bananafish.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0241950430?tag=oceintelleweb-20"> <img alt="The Catcher in the Rye" src="/img/0241950430.jpg" /> </a> <br /> Salinger’s most famous work, <em>
     The Catcher in the Rye
    </em> has sold more than 65m copies around the world since its publication in 1951. The story of three days in the life of Holden Caulfield – whose irritable ennui and contempt for what he calls ‘phoneys’ have made him a poster-boy for adolescent disenchantment – as he drifts around New York after being expelled from school, is widely held up as a defining novel of the 20th century.</p>
      <p>上述新书将由企鹅集团旗下的 Hamish Hamilton 出版社出版，塞迷们可以买来收藏了。</p>
