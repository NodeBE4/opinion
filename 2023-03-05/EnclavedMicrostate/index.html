<p>No, I think you do. Someone buys the game -&gt; JKR gets royalties -&gt; JKR uses her money, which now includes royalties from that game, to fund anti-trans causes (e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/HPANA/status/1518650786347163651">suing LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall</a>; <a href="https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2022/12/14/jk-rowling-funds-sex-abuse-crisis-center-excludes-trans-women">setting up a crisis centre in Scotland explicitly excluding trans people</a>) -&gt; anti-trans causes harm trans people.</p>

<p>QED</p>

<p>—– <strong>1129.2</strong> —–2023-03-02 01:44:55+08:00:</p>

<p>So in other words, the fact that the game has <em>already</em> been used to fund anti-trans causes shouldn’t stop you from promoting it? Even if further purchases of HL don’t <em>immediately</em> go into royalties cheques for JKR, they do still prove the viability of the brand, and thus <em>more</em> royalties down the line.</p>

<p>I don’t think this is the counter-argument you think it is, though, because I think you very much <em>could</em>, even <em>should</em>, make that argument for Nintendo too, on that basis. In any event, in that particular comment at least, I wasn’t even suggesting that there should be a boycott (although I do, in fact, believe so); I was simply stating that the chain of causality does in fact exist.</p>

<p>My moral condemnation isn’t reserved for anyone who may be playing the game without awareness of the nature of the issue: I condemn their actions, but I can accept that they may have no ill intent at the point of purchase. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that people should be informed of the causes that the game’s beneficiaries promote, and I <em>do</em> take umbrage with anyone a) unwilling to engage with that in good faith, and/or b) who will go ahead with promoting the game despite knowing about those issues that have already been enumerated. But ultimately, my moral condemnation is reserved primarily for JK Rowling and the developers of the game.</p>

<p>I’d like to tack on to what was written by /u/iwaka with a paragraph from an ultimately half-formed answer that I never got round to finishing before they wrote theirs (which in any event gets into a lot of things that hadn’t even sprung to mind for me):</p>

<p>To just highlight a few differences of vocabulary here: The Classical verb for ‘to want’, 欲 (<em>yu4</em> in Mandarin, <em>juk6</em> in Cantonese), is <em>incredibly</em> rare in vernacular usage in Mandarin and Cantonese, outside of idiomatic phrases; it does, however, persist in some other languages such as Hakka and Hokkien. In fact, you’re far more likely to see it in Japanese, in noun form as 欲 <em>yoku</em> (desire, want) or in adjective form <em>hoshii</em> 欲しい (desired, wanted). Mandarin and Cantonese speakers today would be far more likely to use 要 <em>yao4</em>/<em>jiu3</em>. The Classical verb ‘to say’, 曰 (<em>yue1</em>/<em>jyut6</em>), is <em>entirely</em> literary. Some Sinitic languages such as Cantonese instead use 話 (<em>wa6</em>), while Mandarin uses 說 (<em>shuo1</em>); both also use 講 (<em>jiang3</em>/<em>gong2</em>) as well (there are dialectical variations in terms of which Mandarin use 說, 講, or both; ditto for 話 and 講 in Cantonese varieties.)</p>

<p>Institutional access, you say? <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZsjVCjF">Don’t mind if I do…</a></p>

<p>I’ll let people who actually understand demography do any interesting analysis that may be done, but I can confirm that Durand is correct when he says that Balazs noted that the number of prefectures counted was halved in the 760 census. In his notes column, the 734 to 754 censuses are remarked as covering between 315 and 362 prefectures depending on the year, whereas the 760 covers a mere 169 prefectures – worthy of an exclamation mark!</p>

<p>His later figures are also worth remarking on, I feel. For 763 he finds a figure of 9 million families – an <em>increase</em> from before the rebellion – which he explicitly highlights as a contemporary estimate, with yet another exclamation mark! Evidently the later sources still suggest a considerable decline in at least reported families, which only recovered to just shy of 5 million by the mid-9th century, but as you note, it’s difficult to suggest that this reflects <em>deaths</em> rather than administrative disintegration.</p>

<p>I’m sure someone with a better grasp of academic German can elucidate on the footnote for 760, but Balazs does note that, if his figures can be extrapolated to include the half not under rebel rule, then that would still constitute a considerable population loss in the empire as a whole, with the number of families having halved even within the assessed territory.</p>

<p>That is, however, a big if, and I would think that were he to have gone into greater depth, then the apparent increase in individuals per family (from about 5.5-6.0 to 8.78) might suggest that the decline in actual population was not as severe as the decline in taxpaying households. I would also be interested to know <em>which</em> prefectures stopped being counted, as An Lushan’s forces primarily operated in what would have been the empire’s metropolitan heartlands in the north Chinese plain. It’s entirely conceivable that the fact that it was relatively densely-populated regions that fell off the administrative map also served to exacerbate the effect in the statistics.</p>

<p>No, I was thinking of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/11iz558/hobby_scuffles_week_of_march_6_2023/jbt2cdc/">this</a> as mentioned by /u/NervousLemon6670</p>

<p>So, on the FallenShadow (aka Shondo) point, someone was pointing out that it’s <em>really rich</em> for her to be complaining about ‘Twitter freaks’ given her past vagueposting about a certain corporate VTuber…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>!More specifically, FallenShadow was a friend of LemonLeaf, both ASMR creators; the latter of whom started streaming as a VTuber in May 2020. In the summer of 2021, when Hololive English’s second generation, Council, was debuting, FallenShadow did several vagueposts on both Twitter and Discord alleging betrayal by one or more close friends. LemonLeaf had recently announced a hiatus, and then on 23 August, Hololive debuted Ceres Fauna, who had a suspiciously LemonLeaf-esque voice. FallenShadow never explicitly said that her posts had been about LemonLeaf/Fauna, but given her own indie VTuber debut around the same time, many have assumed she was bitter about not getting the Hololive audition.!&lt; However, at least publicly the two have appeared to be on good terms, with appearances in chat on each other’s streams; as such some have said the counter-criticism isn’t particularly warranted.</p>
