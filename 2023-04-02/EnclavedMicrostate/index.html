<p>—– <strong>1165.1</strong> —–2023-04-01 11:34:01+08:00:</p>

<p>A book which I’m surprised has not been brought up by anyone here so far is Scott Levi’s <em>The Bukharan Crisis</em> (2020), which, in brief, <em>demolishes</em> the concept of the ‘Silk Road’ pretty comprehensively. He builds on Hansen to some extent, but his main thrust is that the entire concept of a ‘Silk Road’ is Orientalist scholarship trying to assign special significance to Sino-European overland trade that it fundamentally didn’t have. From a Central Asian perspective, the notion that the region was historically subordinated to the whims of European demand for Chinese goods smacks of a certain sedentary-centrism, and also blatantly ignores Central Asia’s considerable trade links with South Asia, which ‘Silk Road’ models of Eurasian trade flagrantly disregard. Granted, he’s coming at this from specifically an Early Modern standpoint, rather than the medieval one which ‘Silk Road’ discussions usually come framed in, but this too is, he notes, problematic – overland trade didn’t suddenly stop at some point, indeed it <em>intensified</em> as maritime links between Europe and Asia became strengthened. It’s been very influential on my own thinking and it’s why I pretty consistently try to put up big asterisks whenever a ‘Silk Road’ discussion comes up on the sub.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.2</strong> —–2023-04-01 17:10:09+08:00:</p>

<p>I can’t speak for anyone but myself, but it was definitely not a slow read for me! Also, unlike a lot of books, it actually has the footnotes <em>on the page</em>, which means you get all of the little snarky comments…</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.3</strong> —–2023-04-01 17:13:30+08:00:</p>

<p>Speaking from a Qing perspective, the Qing did appropriate Chinese dynastic historiographical orthodoxy to a great extent, primarily though not exclusively within China. For instance, it’s notable that in the 1790s, the Qianlong Emperor cited both the Yuan and Ming states as (negative) historical exemplars in justifying increased oversight over succession to office within the Tibetan clergy. But for the most part, the appropriation of Chinese historiographical orthodoxy applied <em>within China proper</em>, rather than in Inner Asia. So the modern Chinese appeal to the dynastic succession is based on a different interpretation of that succession than the Mongols and the Manchus would have understood.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.4</strong> —–2023-04-01 19:43:47+08:00:</p>

<p>So, to address the three in turn:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>network</em> is not defined by a single directional interaction. If you’re trying to describe a <em>network</em> based on the movement of a single commodity in a single direction, you are not describing the network as a whole, you are describing a feature of the network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By focussing on a single commodity in a single direction, you are <em>no longer talking about the network</em>. You are, to put it another way, talking <em>over</em> the network. You are <em>choosing</em> to make Europe and Asia the absentee protagonists of Central Asian history.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By emphasising the ‘Silk Road’ specifically, you <em>aren’t looking at the network</em>, because the land trade network and the sea trade network were parts of the same fundamental network.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If I were to summarise the narrative thrust here, it’s that the ‘Silk Road’ is not the story of a network, it is a cherry-picked story taken from a network, that actively elides the rest of the network by asserting the primacy of that specific story within it.</p>

<p>I also feel I must also overrule /u/DanKensington slightly because the name is also problematic. It’s a name coined by a German in the 1890s to describe a particular route described in a particular source, that was then conflated out to a wide variety of contexts well beyond what that original German was going for, as noted in the linked post.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.5</strong> —–2023-04-01 21:51:12+08:00:</p>

<p>Precisely. There’s nothing special about the ‘Silk Road’ within medieval Eurasia, let alone within the broader spatial and temporal scope of human history.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.6</strong> —–2023-04-01 23:27:46+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess to me using the overland silk trade between Europe and China as a shorthand to describe the exchange as a whole is akin to using, I dunno, the transatlantic slave trade to represent slavery in the early-modern period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m going to push back on this point, because it isn’t even comparable from a scale perspective. The coincidental movement of luxury goods from east to west across Central Asia was not even the largest component of Central Asian trade. For a glib analogy it’d be like saying Paris is particularly significant for being on the rail line from Calais to Marseille. It <em>is</em> on the rail line from Calais to Marseilles, but that linkage is hardly the defining feature that makes Paris what it is. The discarding of the ‘Silk Road’ is being proposed in order to actually understand the multifaceted relationships between Central Asia as a region and its neighbours, rather than centring its history away towards entities at its fringe.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1167.1</strong> —–2023-04-01 08:50:34+08:00:</p>

<p>This is a surprisingly rich story, involving three court ministers, Ping, Pong, and Pang, in the time of the emperor Altoum. Now, Altoum is not exactly a very Chinese name, and there is a reason for that – the events in question took place during the short-lived Western Yi Dynasty, a brief and obscure period principally known through the private chronicle of 普只尼, established by an Inner Asian tribe of uncertain origin. Like many states in China founded by Inner Asian polities, the ruling dynasty in turn found itself at threat from the steppe that it had left behind, as new tribes emerged to fill the gap. By Altoum’s time, this was becoming dire, as the collapse of the Tartarian Empire of Tamerlane had created fierce competition in the steppe that threatened to spill into his territories, and the emperor struggled with the problem of how to explain to these roaming nomads that his nice neat border was not to be traversed.</p>

<p>It was around this time that Ping, Pong, and Pang were working on the development of a new sport that could be played in a limited space. In its first iteration, three players would circle around a round table carrying frying pans, which they would use to hit a ball across the table between them. A pass was only valid if the ball bounced once, but if it missed the table or bounced twice, the player who had just attempted to pass had lost, and the player who had last passed to them had won.</p>

<p>This was deemed somewhat unwieldy, and so gradually there was a shift towards wooden paddles for convenience, followed by a more radical step of replacing the round table with a rectangular one with a net across the middle, and changing the game to one of two players. Pang, unfortunately, tended to be the one left to referee at the side. This was to have rather unfortunate consequences in the long term, but more immediately, when the game was completed, Ping and Pong chose to publicise the game without crediting Pang. Henceforth, it was to be known as The Game of Ping and Pong, or merely Ping-Pong for short.</p>

<p>But Ping appears not to have reckoned that his connivance with Pong would later backfire on him. Pong had come to discover the remarkable bounciness of steel against steel, and privately developed his own variant of Ping-Pong in a small frame, with one sliding block on each side that would be used to deflect a steel ball, initially actuated using a springloaded mechanism. Pong then took his invention to the court without Ping, presenting it as The Game of Pong, which he invited the emperor to try.</p>

<p>As the game progressed, however, Altoum noted that it was odd that there was a line across the middle of the Pong board, that seemed to serve no useful purpose. He had, however, heard rumours of a Game of Ping and Pong where the table had a central net that could catch the ball mid-flight, and was curious about whether that had influenced the line’s inclusion. Sensing possible danger should he give the wrong answer, Pong improvised: the point of the Game of Pong was not merely sport, but indeed a philosophical tool, intended to teach the lesson that the mere drawing of a line does not, in itself, affect the physical world.</p>

<p>This proved to be an apt statement, as Altoum appears to have had a eureka moment at that point, realising that the mere existence of a border would not stop raiding; he needed to actively prohibit movement. He needed to build a wall. And so it was that the Game of Pong led to the construction of a (not quite <em>the</em>) great wall in northern China.</p>

<p>But there is, however, a tragicomic coda to all this. Pang, jilted by his former friends, stole Pong’s research into steel elasticity, and travelled into the steppe, where he made contact with the Muslim warlord A’Tari, bringing with him a proposal for a new siege engine. A steel ball, initially launched by a catapult, would be repeatedly reflected against a large steel plate, allowing a wall to slowly be worn down, brick by brick. Unfortunately, a lack of access to sufficient steel meant that in practice, instead of a plate large enough to reflect the ball consistently, there was instead a smaller plate that would have to be moved by gantry to meet the ball every time it bounced off the target wall. Any failure to intercept the ball as it rolled back could be fatal to the operators, and it was deemed that any more than three lives lost in this way meant the siege should be called off.</p>

<p>And so it was that Pang, the forgotten colleague of Ping and Pong, invented Breakout.</p>

For more information on this rule, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/">please see this Rules Roundtable</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you didn’t mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the ‘Short Answers’ thread would be “Who won the 1932 election?” or “What are some famous natural disasters from the past?”. Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be “How did FDR win the 1932 election?”, or “In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?” If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/">Rules Roundtable</a> on asking better questions.</p>

<p>Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).</p>
