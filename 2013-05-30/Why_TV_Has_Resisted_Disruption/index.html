    I think it does hold water, and I’d actually use Silicon Valley as the analogy: what makes Silicon Valley possible, and so hard to replicate, is not just the presence of startups or willing entrepreneurs; rather, the critical factor is Sand Hill Road. Angels and VCs with substantial war chests and the willingness to make ten deals knowing that nine will fail are essential to what makes the Valley go.
    In the case of TV, networks are the VCs. They pay for expensive pilots and concepts, many of which don’t turn out, and bank on making money on the ones that do. They’re just as critical to great content creation as are the producers, directors, actors, etc. And networks love the affiliate system.
     Netflix is just another network 
    Netflix famously pivoted from DVDs-by-mail to streaming, but that was only pivot number one. Pivot number two was their transformation from a content delivery provider to simply another network.
    Think about it: Netflix invests millions of dollars in new TV shows to drive growth, and has reruns and old movies as filler. They’re HBO with a unique delivery system. Or, to fit the analogy, Netflix is just another VC, with a war chest built by a completely different business (the aforementioned discs-by-mail).
    Netflix is unique, but ultimately uninteresting, and unlikely to be replicated.

     Why TV Has Resisted Disruption 
    
  Posted on             Thursday, May 30, 2013

    This is Part 2 of an exploration of what changes, if any, may be coming to TV.
    
     Yesterday I examined
    
    why cutting the cord yet keeping the shows you watch (i.e. unbundling) was a fantasy. Also, I should note that yesterday and today’s post are very US-centric; more on the international potential in Part 3
   
    Pay-TV is  a good deal  for networks, cable companies, 
    and
    users. It’s socialism that works.
    But what about the content? Isn’t that the point? Free the content from the networks, and at last we can pay a nominal fee to watch what we want on any Internet-connected device.
    Well, yes, it is about the content; in fact, it’s the content that, in my mind, protects the current system from being significantly disrupted.
     Great content has low elasticity of substitution 
    Not all Pay-TV is created equal; while filler content is everywhere, it’s truly great content that drives affiliate fees. Look at the  most expensive networks  on a per-subscriber basis:
    
         
Affiliate fees and CPMs
      
    
    
      Sports is obviously huge here. There is no substitute, and the affiliate fees reflect that
      Disney Channel and Nickelodeon have fantastic brands; Dora, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and Phineas and Ferb  1  are the Lakers, Yankees and Cowboys of kids programming
      TNT, USA, TBS and FX all have original programming with sizable fan bases, and TNT has the NBA
      FOX News has highly differentiated itself. I’ll leave it at that.
    
    None of this content is easily substituted, which allows networks to increase affiliate fees, which serves to 
    preserve
    the current system.
     Great content production has a high barrier to entry 
    Sports is, once again, the obvious story here. There is a finite supply of programming, it is rarely time-shifted (which drives advertising dollars – see the right-side of the chart above), and it’s incredibly expensive. At the national level:
    
      $4.4 billion a year for NFL rights (beginning in 2014)  link 
      $930 million a year for NBA rights (contract ends in 2016)  link 
      $800 million a year for MLB rights (beginning in 2014)  link 
    
    This doesn’t include the myriad of college sports, nor regional deals. It’s a lot of money that is directly connected to rising affiliate fees.
    But great scripted programming is expensive as well. AMC pays  an estimated $2.71 million  for an episode of Mad Men, and Netflix  paid $100 million  for two 13-episode seasons of House of Cards (more on Netflix in a moment).
    Anything that conceivably draws customers away from the pay-TV model will need to have compelling content, and said content has a very stiff price of entry.
     Networks matter just as much as content 
    Several folks noted that yesterday’s post focused on networks, not shows.

    I think it does hold water, and I’d actually use Silicon Valley as the analogy: what makes Silicon Valley possible, and so hard to replicate, is not just the presence of startups or willing entrepreneurs; rather, the critical factor is Sand Hill Road. Angels and VCs with substantial war chests and the willingness to make ten deals knowing that nine will fail are essential to what makes the Valley go.
    In the case of TV, networks are the VCs. They pay for expensive pilots and concepts, many of which don’t turn out, and bank on making money on the ones that do. They’re just as critical to great content creation as are the producers, directors, actors, etc. And networks love the affiliate system.
     Netflix is just another network 
    Netflix famously pivoted from DVDs-by-mail to streaming, but that was only pivot number one. Pivot number two was their transformation from a content delivery provider to simply another network.
    Think about it: Netflix invests millions of dollars in new TV shows to drive growth, and has reruns and old movies as filler. They’re HBO with a unique delivery system. Or, to fit the analogy, Netflix is just another VC, with a war chest built by a completely different business (the aforementioned discs-by-mail).
    Netflix is unique, but ultimately uninteresting, and unlikely to be replicated.

     Why TV Has Resisted Disruption 
    
  Posted on             Thursday, May 30, 2013

     Author  by  Ben Thompson   
    
    
  
  
  
    
    This is Part 2 of an exploration of what changes, if any, may be coming to TV.
    
     Yesterday I examined
    
    why cutting the cord yet keeping the shows you watch (i.e. unbundling) was a fantasy. Also, I should note that yesterday and today’s post are very US-centric; more on the international potential in Part 3
   
    Pay-TV is  a good deal  for networks, cable companies, 
    and
    users. It’s socialism that works.
    But what about the content? Isn’t that the point? Free the content from the networks, and at last we can pay a nominal fee to watch what we want on any Internet-connected device.
    Well, yes, it is about the content; in fact, it’s the content that, in my mind, protects the current system from being significantly disrupted.
     Great content has low elasticity of substitution 
    Not all Pay-TV is created equal; while filler content is everywhere, it’s truly great content that drives affiliate fees. Look at the  most expensive networks  on a per-subscriber basis:
    
         
Affiliate fees and CPMs
      
    
    
      Sports is obviously huge here. There is no substitute, and the affiliate fees reflect that
      Disney Channel and Nickelodeon have fantastic brands; Dora, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and Phineas and Ferb  1  are the Lakers, Yankees and Cowboys of kids programming
      TNT, USA, TBS and FX all have original programming with sizable fan bases, and TNT has the NBA
      FOX News has highly differentiated itself. I’ll leave it at that.
    
    None of this content is easily substituted, which allows networks to increase affiliate fees, which serves to 
    preserve
    the current system.
     Great content production has a high barrier to entry 
    Sports is, once again, the obvious story here. There is a finite supply of programming, it is rarely time-shifted (which drives advertising dollars – see the right-side of the chart above), and it’s incredibly expensive. At the national level:
    
      $4.4 billion a year for NFL rights (beginning in 2014)  link 
      $930 million a year for NBA rights (contract ends in 2016)  link 
      $800 million a year for MLB rights (beginning in 2014)  link 
    
    This doesn’t include the myriad of college sports, nor regional deals. It’s a lot of money that is directly connected to rising affiliate fees.
    But great scripted programming is expensive as well. AMC pays  an estimated $2.71 million  for an episode of Mad Men, and Netflix  paid $100 million  for two 13-episode seasons of House of Cards (more on Netflix in a moment).
    Anything that conceivably draws customers away from the pay-TV model will need to have compelling content, and said content has a very stiff price of entry.
     Networks matter just as much as content 
    Several folks noted that yesterday’s post focused on networks, not shows.
    
      An interesting economic analysis of cable – at the network level. Drop to the “show” level; does it still hold water?  stratechery.com/2013/the-cord-… 
      — Paul Curcio (@pcurc)  May 29, 2013 
    
    
    I think it does hold water, and I’d actually use Silicon Valley as the analogy: what makes Silicon Valley possible, and so hard to replicate, is not just the presence of startups or willing entrepreneurs; rather, the critical factor is Sand Hill Road. Angels and VCs with substantial war chests and the willingness to make ten deals knowing that nine will fail are essential to what makes the Valley go.
    In the case of TV, networks are the VCs. They pay for expensive pilots and concepts, many of which don’t turn out, and bank on making money on the ones that do. They’re just as critical to great content creation as are the producers, directors, actors, etc. And networks love the affiliate system.
     Netflix is just another network 
    Netflix famously pivoted from DVDs-by-mail to streaming, but that was only pivot number one. Pivot number two was their transformation from a content delivery provider to simply another network.
    Think about it: Netflix invests millions of dollars in new TV shows to drive growth, and has reruns and old movies as filler. They’re HBO with a unique delivery system. Or, to fit the analogy, Netflix is just another VC, with a war chest built by a completely different business (the aforementioned discs-by-mail).
    Netflix is unique, but ultimately uninteresting, and unlikely to be replicated.
     YouTube is Kickstarter 
    One final analogy: just as Kickstarter lets entrepreneurs forego VCs, YouTube lets content creators forego networks. That’s fine as far as it goes, but the likelihood of a breakthrough hit is low, and if one were to occur, it would likely be snapped up by a network.

    <p><em>
    This is Part 2 of an exploration of what changes, if any, may be coming to TV.
    <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/the-cord-cutting-fantasy/">
     Yesterday I examined
    </a>
    why cutting the cord yet keeping the shows you watch (i.e. unbundling) was a fantasy. Also, I should note that yesterday and today’s post are very US-centric; more on the international potential in Part 3
   </em></p>
    <p>Pay-TV is <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/the-cord-cutting-fantasy/"> a good deal </a> for networks, cable companies, <em>
    and
   </em> users. It’s socialism that works.</p>
    <p>But what about the content? Isn’t that the point? Free the content from the networks, and at last we can pay a nominal fee to watch what we want on any Internet-connected device.</p>
    <p>Well, yes, it is about the content; in fact, it’s the content that, in my mind, protects the current system from being significantly disrupted.</p>
    <h4 id="great-content-has-low-elasticity-of-substitution-"> Great content has low elasticity of substitution </h4>
    <p>Not all Pay-TV is created equal; while filler content is everywhere, it’s truly great content that drives affiliate fees. Look at the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2012/11/09/why-espn-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-media-property-and-worth-40-billion/"> most expensive networks </a> on a per-subscriber basis:</p>
    <figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_365" style="width: 640px">
<a href="http://tvaholics.blogspot.com/2012/02/affiliate-fees-drive-cable-networks.html"> <img alt="Affiliate fees and CPMs" class="size-full wp-image-365" height="509" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cable_fees_2012.gif" width="640" /> </a>       <figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-365">
Affiliate fees and CPMs
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
      <li>Sports is obviously huge here. There is no substitute, and the affiliate fees reflect that</li>
      <li>Disney Channel and Nickelodeon have fantastic brands; Dora, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and Phineas and Ferb <a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" href="#footnote_0_364" id="identifier_0_364" title="This originally said Phineas and Herb. Oops. Thanks to Mike Byrne for the correction"> 1 </a> are the Lakers, Yankees and Cowboys of kids programming</li>
      <li>TNT, USA, TBS and FX all have original programming with sizable fan bases, and TNT has the NBA</li>
      <li>FOX News has highly differentiated itself. I’ll leave it at that.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of this content is easily substituted, which allows networks to increase affiliate fees, which serves to <em>
    preserve
   </em> the current system.</p>
    <h4 id="great-content-production-has-a-high-barrier-to-entry-"> Great content production has a high barrier to entry </h4>
    <p>Sports is, once again, the obvious story here. There is a finite supply of programming, it is rarely time-shifted (which drives advertising dollars – see the right-side of the chart above), and it’s incredibly expensive. At the national level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$4.4 billion a year for NFL rights (beginning in 2014) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_on_television"> link </a></li>
      <li>$930 million a year for NBA rights (contract ends in 2016) <a href="http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/abcnbanewdeal.html"> link </a></li>
      <li>$800 million a year for MLB rights (beginning in 2014) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_television_contracts"> link </a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This doesn’t include the myriad of college sports, nor regional deals. It’s a lot of money that is directly connected to rising affiliate fees.</p>
    <p>But great scripted programming is expensive as well. AMC pays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men#Finances"> an estimated $2.71 million </a> for an episode of Mad Men, and Netflix <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/02/economics-netflixs-100-million-new-show/61692/"> paid $100 million </a> for two 13-episode seasons of House of Cards (more on Netflix in a moment).</p>
    <p>Anything that conceivably draws customers away from the pay-TV model will need to have compelling content, and said content has a very stiff price of entry.</p>
    <h4 id="networks-matter-just-as-much-as-content-"> Networks matter just as much as content </h4>
    <p>Several folks noted that yesterday’s post focused on networks, not shows.</p>
    <blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet">
      <p>An interesting economic analysis of cable – at the network level. Drop to the “show” level; does it still hold water? <a href="http://t.co/t5IGOO2fXU" title="http://stratechery.com/2013/the-cord-cutting-fantasy/"> stratechery.com/2013/the-cord-… </a></p>
      <p>— Paul Curcio (@pcurc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pcurc/status/339754473561935872"> May 29, 2013 </a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>I think it does hold water, and I’d actually use Silicon Valley as the analogy: what makes Silicon Valley possible, and so hard to replicate, is not just the presence of startups or willing entrepreneurs; rather, the critical factor is Sand Hill Road. Angels and VCs with substantial war chests and the willingness to make ten deals knowing that nine will fail are essential to what makes the Valley go.</p>
    <p>In the case of TV, networks are the VCs. They pay for expensive pilots and concepts, many of which don’t turn out, and bank on making money on the ones that do. They’re just as critical to great content creation as are the producers, directors, actors, etc. And networks love the affiliate system.</p>
    <h4 id="netflix-is-just-another-network-"> Netflix is just another network </h4>
    <p>Netflix famously pivoted from DVDs-by-mail to streaming, but that was only pivot number one. Pivot number two was their transformation from a content delivery provider to simply another network.</p>
    <p>Think about it: Netflix invests millions of dollars in new TV shows to drive growth, and has reruns and old movies as filler. They’re HBO with a unique delivery system. Or, to fit the analogy, Netflix is just another VC, with a war chest built by a completely different business (the aforementioned discs-by-mail).</p>
    <p>Netflix is unique, but ultimately uninteresting, and unlikely to be replicated.</p>
    <h4 id="youtube-is-kickstarter-"> YouTube is Kickstarter </h4>
    <p>One final analogy: just as Kickstarter lets entrepreneurs forego VCs, YouTube lets content creators forego networks. That’s fine as far as it goes, but the likelihood of a breakthrough hit is low, and if one were to occur, it would likely be snapped up by a network.</p>
