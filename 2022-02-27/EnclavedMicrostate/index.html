<p>—– <strong>152.1</strong> —–2022-02-21 12:08:56+08:00:</p>

<p>I think the best way of conceptualising Hololive fandom is as anime fandom being applied to a group of streamers. So yes, the level of lewd art is exceptionally high if your point of reference is IRL streamer fandoms, but it’s pretty typical by anime fandom standards.</p>

<p>—– <strong>152.2</strong> —–2022-02-21 12:54:04+08:00:</p>

<p>It depends on the individual. Gaming is almost ubiquitous, but some will do gaming streams nigh-exclusively while others only do it as a portion of their content, with the rest being some combination of chatting, art, music, clip/meme reviews, and the like. There do tend to be trends for certain groups: Hololive, to which Shiranui Flare belongs, tends to be a bit more overtly diversified in terms of content, so for instance while Flare mostly does gaming streams, she also does a (relatively) high proportion of karaoke streams, averaging around one a week. Probably the best representative of Hololive’s ‘variety entertainment’ style would be Hololive English’s Mori Calliope, who until recently streamed basically constantly and who does a pretty big variety of stuff: gaming streams obviously, but also a lot of music and chatting, occasional art, a podcast with a couple of other Hololive English members, and also English learning streams with some of Hololive’s Japanese members. Members of VShojo, which is the main English-language VTuber group on Twitch, don’t emphasise music and art content to the same extent, but they’re not absent outright.</p>

<p>—– <strong>152.3</strong> —–2022-02-21 13:07:40+08:00:</p>

<p>To put it a better way, all of them stream video games but they also do other things. Hololive in particular still brands itself mainly as a variety entertainment agency rather than just video game streamers, so its members have a strong emphasis on music (as well as other, more individual content) aside from just gaming. A large part of this is because Japanese VTubing drew in not just gaming content creators but also utaite (cover singers) and amateur idols, where music had been their primary content to begin with, though in Hololive’s case in particular there’s also an explicit ‘idol group’ angle and aesthetic involved just to hit it home a bit harder. Even so it’s not just Hololive doing concerts, Nijisanji (the next biggest agency) also does them even without the overt idol theme.</p>

<p>—– <strong>152.4</strong> —–2022-02-21 13:27:49+08:00:</p>

<p>There’s a lot of Coco hero-worship particularly in relation to Hololive English, but according to Hololive’s own staff, the process of forming Hololive English had started months before Coco’s debut, as part of a general international expansion plan that had begun with the (now-defunct) Chinese branch and the (still active) Indonesian branch over late 2019-early 2020. Coco was a big signal booster for HoloEN, but not its originator by any means. She was definitely a particularly engaged member who gave a lot of support to fellow Hololive members and that is worth celebrating, but the notion that she was Hololive’s Atlas holding up the sky really understates the initiative of talents and staff alike.</p>

<p>—– <strong>152.5</strong> —–2022-02-21 17:58:40+08:00:</p>

<p>So obviously it’s far from certain, but there are a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hololive started an EN Twitter back in November 2019. To be fair, it also created a Korean account two months later that has been dormant ever since, so it’s not a <em>firm</em> indication that a branch was in development, but it’s an aspect of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hololive was rolling out new international branches every few months, with an obvious delay of sorts owing to COVID, but it would be at least plausible that EN would be ‘in the works’ so to speak but not actively pursued until CN and ID debuted. There’s a post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Holostars/comments/r9a5pt/my_thoughts_on_the_debut_of_holox_and_what_i/">here</a> which obviously is just another Redditor’s speculation, but they suggest that because ID requires English fluency, ID and EN share or shared a hiring team that alternated between the two branches, which is why there were such gaps between the first two generations of both branches. To put it another way there was definitely work being done on an English-<em>language</em> branch well before Coco’s involvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the sub count thing, Fubuki was at over 300k by the end of 2019 and Sora had been coasting at around 250k for a while, so it was definitely not out of the question to pursue international expansion, especially given they were already doing CN and ID by the end of 2019.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the year in advance, there’s a <a href="https://grapee.jp/en/169910">slightly odd article</a> involving a supposed interview with an anonymous head producer for HoloEN in early 2021 saying that things are planned out about a year ahead when it comes to EN, which isn’t clear should be extrapolated all the way back to mean that HoloEN was in the works as early as September 2019, but it definitely <em>could</em> be.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As noted, much of this is necessarily speculative because Cover doesn’t just leak info constantly, but considering that new debuts at Hololive do generally take quite a long time to prepare, it does seem pretty reasonable to suggest that there was a plan to create HoloEN by late 2019 at the latest.</p>

<p>—– <strong>152.6</strong> —–2022-02-23 11:23:03+08:00:</p>

<p>Depends which harassment: the long story short is the girl’s fans mostly harassed the guy and vice versa.</p>

<p>—– <strong>152.7</strong> —–2022-02-23 11:25:13+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>only one brought in wholesale from her prior company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite, she had started as an indie, signed on with an agency briefly, and then left again a good while before getting into Hololive.</p>

<p>—– <strong>156.1</strong> —–2022-02-23 11:14:32+08:00:</p>

<p>Without trying to start a slapfight, I feel like that critique principally consists of quibbling over interpreting some admittedly ambiguous wording on Invicta’s part that doesn’t actually impinge on the content that much. The fact is, we <em>don’t</em> know where the Immortals were garrisoned, how they were recruited, or how they were trained. We know that there were <em>some</em> troops stationed in the vicinity of the palace, but not which; we know that the Immortals were recruited from the Persian population, but not on what basis; and we know that Persian nobles had some degree of individual martial training from birth, but not if they trained as a unit (nor, moreover, if the non-noble Persians making up the bulk of the royal corps had comparable individual training to the nobles). The remainder of the critique seems to be based on the idea that we ought to take Herodotos as precisely correct in all details at face value, rather than even allowing the possibility of a ‘may’ in there. Granted, Herodotos is also pretty unambiguous that all but one of the Immortals did stay behind for Plataiai, so that is a goof, but by and large the majority of objections are to the presence of the word ‘may’ at all.</p>

<p>—– <strong>156.2</strong> —–2022-02-24 13:25:53+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it seems unlikely to me that the 10’000 immortals, who are constantly being replaced, we’re all aristocrats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed not, and in fact we can quote Herodotos (7.41) here to show it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind him came a thousand spearmen of the best and noblest blood of Persia, carrying their spears in the customary manner; after them a thousand picked Persian horsemen, and after the horse ten thousand that were footmen, chosen out of the rest of the Persians. One thousand of these latter bore golden pomegranates on their spear-shafts in place of the spike, and surrounded the rest; the nine thousand were enclosed within, and bore silver pomegranates; they that held their spears reversed carried golden pomegranates also, and they that were nearest to Xerxes, apples of gold. After the ten thousand came ten thousand Persian horsemen in array. After these there was a space of two furlongs, and next the rest of the multitude followed without order or division.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in what we might term the ‘royal corps’ of Persian standing troops, 1000 (the spearmen in the vanguard) were recruited from the nobility, 1000 (the cavalry) are implied to have been the same, and 20,000 (10,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry) were recruited from the Persian population writ large.</p>

<p>—– <strong>156.3</strong> —–2022-02-28 17:57:38+08:00:</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn’t intend to leave you entirely on read but I’ve built up a bit of a message backlog lately. The main thing is that the video does <em>not</em> treat the Immortals as being unknown, but rather it opts to be conservative and not make firm assertions. Yes, synthesis is important, but it isn’t a definitive statement, and surely this is especially true of fields like ancient Mediterranean history where few sources exist and where said sources must be and are dissected in immense detail.</p>

<p>What I found problematic was not the use of the sources as definitive, but rather attempting to make these sources say what they don’t. Invicta says we don’t know where they were garrisoned, and you disagree based on Cyrus’ inscription at Bisotun, but we simply do not know who the troops at the palace consisted of. Invicta says we don’t know how the Immortals were recruited, and you disagree based on Herodotos, but what Herodotos says is <em>who</em> they were recruited <em>from</em> (1000 each of foot and horse from the Persian nobility, 10,000 each of foot and horse from non-noble Persians), but not <em>how</em> (volunteering? selection by lot? conscription?). Invicta says we don’t know if and how they were trained, and you disagree based on Herodotos, but what Herodotos says is that Persian nobles, specifically, trained from youth in weapons and riding, but not if the Immortals trained as a unit, nor, critically, does he say anything about such training on the part of <em>non</em>-noble Persians. In the garrison case I would agree that you could <em>suggest</em> that the 22,000 Persian troops described by Herodotos were probably attached to the palace in some capacity, but that’s not something we <em>know</em>. It’s something we might surmise in attempting to reconcile our sources.</p>

<p>—– <strong>156.4</strong> —–2022-03-01 20:35:58+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The video was not being conservative at all. The assertion it makes are that such questions are unanswered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would make a distinction here, in that the video asserts that the questions are <em>unanswerable</em>, i.e. there are a considerable number of overt gaps in our knowledge that no amount of speculative insertion will compensate for. There are a lot of answers out there, but none are definitive because there is too little evidence to firmly discuss. And if we’re talking about secondary literature, Sean Manning states in his <a href="https://diglib.uibk.ac.at/urn:nbn:at:at-ubi:1-30064">freely available PhD thesis on the Persian army</a> (the basis for his recent book) that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have not discussed the “ten thousand immortals,” the kardakes, or the elephants at Gaugamela because it is so hard to connect the classical sources which mention them to other evidence. A great deal of research is devoted to these topics, and it is intriguing to speculate about the Old Persian word for “companion” and Indo-European warbands of young men, but these speculations rest upon a tiny base of evidence. On the other hand, linking Herodotus’ procession with reversed spears to Neo-Assyrian reliefs and a Hittite rule, his story about the flying snakes of Ethiopia to Assyrian annals and a passage in Josephus, or his story about Oibares and the mare to an omen list, has been more productive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of footnotes here I’ve cut, but so much ink has been spilled precisely because so little has been conclusive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alternatively, the assertions were exceptionally broad. If the video had said “there is no evidence in the sources describing how the Immortals were trained to operate as a unit”, that would be correct. But the claim ‘we do not know how they were trained’ is pretty all encompassing, and is found not be to be the case with a deeper reading of Herodotus. In doing so, we can find evidence of individual training for members of the Immortals. Is it training to operate in a unit? No, but it is still a response to the point the video raises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that it is perfectly cromulent to say we do not know how the Immortals were trained, if the only information we were going on was Herodotos’ claim that all Persian boys were trained in riding and archery, because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We have to evaluate whether Herodotos is making an accurate claim at all, as well as whether this was purely an ideal or also done in practice;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Immortals included infantry spearmen, so did they have spear training?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Herodotos himself states, this education lasted from the ages of five to twenty; assuming this was true, was there formal training or not after that age?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was this package of education something that mainly applied to the nobility rather than the broader population? And if so then given that the most likely candidate for the Immortals is the 10,000 infantry whom Herodotos describes as being drawn from the <em>rest</em> of the Persians, then how far can we even be sure that they had undergone it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And finally, was there training as a unit?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It isn’t that there are no reasonable answers to these questions, but rather that there are virtually no provable ones because the information largely is not there, at least when it comes to the specific matter of the 10,000 troops termed ‘immortals’ by Herodotos.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A bit of a tangential question deriving from sheer curiosity, but I have on occasion seen the suggestion that the Daiva Inscription is possibly a very oblique reference to the invasion of Greece. Now, that’s basically unprovable, but for that same reason I’m curious what basis has been given for the events being c. 486. Is there certain contextual evidence within the inscription, corroborated against other known narrative or epigraphic sources, that suggests a date in the mid-480s?</p>

<p>Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth">rules concerning the scope of questions</a>. However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.</p>

<p>So for example, if you wanted to ask, “<em>Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?</em>” we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask “<em>In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?</em>” we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

<p>This submission has been removed because it violates the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions">rule on poll-type questions</a>. These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the “most”, the “worst”, “unknown”, or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.

<p>Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth">rules concerning the scope of questions</a>. However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.</p>

<p>So for example, if you wanted to ask, “<em>Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?</em>” we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask “<em>In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?</em>” we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus!

<p>—– <strong>178.1</strong> —–2022-03-01 21:36:23+08:00:</p>

<p>Part of it is that Kiara is, as other commenters have noted, rather outspoken and rather blunt, and often a bit inarticulate as English isn’t her first language – I honestly wouldn’t be shocked if her Japanese was better! – and that’s often led to things being taken badly out of context. And I think on some level there are those who don’t like that outspokenness and bluntness in the first place. Some find her a bit grating on stream and I kind of get that as I’ve gone on and off her streams regularly, but that’s a matter of tastes and not of quality.</p>

<p>Although if it’s involving the image board crowds, well there’s some older baggage with Kiara relating to an earlier stint in the Japanese entertainment business where she was badly mistreated by colleagues and managers, which kind of spawned two parallel groups: one which, because they’re image board users, insists that she must have been horrible and toxic because the guy (i.e. the manager) said so, and one which, rather surprisingly for image board users, was generally sympathetic. So there are some long-term Kiara hatewatchers mixed in there.</p>
