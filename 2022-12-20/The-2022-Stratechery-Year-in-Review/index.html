<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-2022-stratechery-year-in-review/">The 2022 Stratechery Year in Review</a>
——</p>

<div>
  <p>It was only a year ago that I opened the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/the-2021-stratechery-year-in-review/">2021 Year in Review</a> by noting that the news felt like a bit of a drag; the contrast to 2022 has been stark. The biggest story in tech not just this year but, I would argue, since the advent of mobile and cloud computing, was the emergence of AI. AI looms large not simply in terms of products, but also its connection to the semiconductor industry; that means the impact is not only a question of technology and society, but also geopolitics and, potentially, war. War, meanwhile, came to Europe, while inflation came to the world; tech valuations collapsed and the crypto bubble burst, and brought to light one of the largest frauds in history. All of this was discussed on Twitter, even as Twitter itself came to dominate the conversation, thanks to its purchase by Elon Musk.</p>

  <p>Stratechery, meanwhile, entering its 10th year of publishing, underwent major changes of its own; a subscription to the Daily Update newsletter transformed into a subscription to the Stratechery Plus bundle, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>, my twice-weekly 15-minute show with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>’s John Gruber.</li>
    <li><a href="https://sharptech.fm/">Sharp Tech</a>, my new twice-weekly hour-long show with Andrew Sharp.</li>
    <li><a href="https://sharpchina.fm/">Sharp China</a>, a new weekly show with Andrew Sharp and <a href="https://sinocism.com/">Sinocism</a>’s Bill Bishop.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">Stratechery Interviews</a>, meanwhile, became its own distinct brand, befitting its weekly schedule and increased prominence in Stratechery’s offering. I am excited to see Stratechery Plus continue to expand in 2023.</p>

  <p>This year Stratechery published 33 free Weekly Articles, 111 subscriber Updates, and 36 Interviews. Today, as per tradition, I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year on Stratechery.</p>

  <p>The five most-viewed articles on Stratechery according to page views:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-homework/">AI Homework</a> — It seems appropriate that this article, written after the launch of ChatGPT, was the most popular of the year because AI is, in my estimation, the most important story of the year. This article used homework as a way to discuss how verifying and editing information will not only be essential in the future, but already are. I wrote two other articles about AI:      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/">DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Content</a> — Machine-learning generated content has major implications on the Metaverse, because it brings the marginal cost of production to zero.</li>
        <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-ai-unbundling/">The AI Unbundling</a> — AI is starting to unbundle the final part of the idea propagation value chain: idea creation and substantiation. The impacts will be far-reaching.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/meta-myths/">Meta Myths</a> — Meta deserves a bit of a discount off of its recent highs, but a number of myths about its business have caused the market to over-react. See also:      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/instagram-tiktok-and-the-three-trends/">Instagram, TikTok, and the Three Trends</a> — Trends in medium, AI, and user interaction underpin Instagram’s response to TikTok, and will determine Meta’s long-term moat.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/shopifys-evolution/">Shopify’s Evolution</a> — Shopify should build an advertising business to complement Shop Pay and the Shopify Fulfillment Network. An additional challenge for Shopify is the changing nature of Amazon’s moat:      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/beyond-aggregation-amazon-as-a-service/">Beyond Aggregation: Amazon as a Service</a> — Amazon’s new Buy With Prime announced the arrival of Amazon Logistics as a Service, and is a big red flag for Shopify.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/">Digital Advertising in 2022</a> — The advertising has shifted from a Google-Facebook duopoly to one where Amazon and potentially Apple are major forces. Speaking of Apple:      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/data-and-definitions/">Data and Definitions</a> — Explaining exactly why Apple’s approach to ATT is anti-competitive.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/nvidia-in-the-valley/">Nvidia In the Valley</a> — Nvidia is in the valley in terms of gaming, the data center, and the omniverse; if it makes it to future heights its margins will be well-earned.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="semiconductors-and-geopolitics">Semiconductors and Geopolitics</h3>
  <p>Geopolitics, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and relations with China, were major stories this year; semiconductors figured prominently in both.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-intel-split/">The Intel Split</a> — It appears that Intel’s partnership with TSMC is much larger than it first seemed; the implications for Intel as whole are massive. <em>See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/mr-cisc-vs-mr-risc-arm-and-amd-threats-gelsingers-three-tenets/">Mr. CISC vs. Mr. RISC, ARM and AMD Threats, Gelsinger’s Three Tenets</a>, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/chips-act-america-china-and-intel-micron-and-tsmc/">CHIPS Act; America, China, and Intel; Micron and TSMC</a>.</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/tech-and-war/">Tech and War</a> — The reaction to the Ukraine invasion has been a demonstration of tech capabilities; those capabilities may be the key to compelling China to pressure Russia.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/political-chips/">Political Chips</a> — Chips are the clearest example that economic efficiencies will not be the ultimate decider of technology’s end state: politics will play an important role.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/chips-and-china/">Chips and China</a> — Understanding the path the semiconductor industry took to today both shows where China needs to go and also explains why the risks for geopolitical conflict are higher than ever. <em>See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-china-chip-ban-the-logic-of-the-ban-chinese-retaliation-or-not/">The China Chip Ban; The Logic of the Ban; Chinese Retaliation, or Not</a>, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-china-chip-ban-the-logic-of-the-ban-chinese-retaliation-or-not/">More on the China Chip Ban, The AI Focus, Apple and YMTC</a>.</em></li>

  <h3 id="aggregators-and-platforms">Aggregators and Platforms</h3>
  <p>A central theme on Stratechery has always been platforms and Aggregators.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/opensea-raises-money-bans-nfts-openseas-value-cryptos-aggregators/">OpenSea, Web3, and Aggregation Theory</a> — OpenSea is positioned as another Aggregator, which is evidence that Web 3 is a layer on top of the Internet, not a replacement.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/gaming-the-smiling-curve/">Gaming the Smiling Curve</a> — The spate of recent acquisitions in the gaming space — Take-Two and Zynga, Microsoft and Activision, and Sony and Bungie — make sense in the context of the Smiling Curve.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/thin-platforms/">Thin Platforms</a> — The Microsoft and Stripe developer keynotes were both examples of the rise of Thin Platforms. <em>See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/browsers-and-regulation-thin-platforms-bundling-and-unbundling/">Browsers and Regulation; Thin Platforms, Bundling, and Unbundling</a>.</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/spotify-netflix-and-aggregation/">Spotify, Netflix, and Aggregation</a> — The original definition of Aggregation Theory emphasized the importance of commoditized supply; that makes Spotify more of an Aggregator than Netflix. <em>See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/spotifys-investor-day-spotifys-music-aggregation-podcast-anecdata/">Spotify’s Investor Day, Spotify’s Music Aggregation, Podcast Anecdata</a>.</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thinplatforms-4.png?resize=640%2C354&#038;ssl=1" alt="A drawing of The Stripe Thin Platform" width="640" height="354" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9109" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thinplatforms-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thinplatforms-4.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thinplatforms-4.png?resize=1024%2C566&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thinplatforms-4.png?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thinplatforms-4.png?resize=1141%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
  <p>These themes inevitably lead to questions of antitrust, and I disagree with the biggest FTC action of the year:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/consoles-and-competition/">Consoles and Competition</a> — Reviewing the history of video games explains why Sony is dominant today, and why Microsoft is actually introducing competition, not limiting it. <em>See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/google-kills-stadia-why-stadia-was-a-bad-product-microsoft-activision-and-antitrust/">Google Kills Stadia; Why Stadia Was a Bad Product; Microsoft, Activision, and Antitrust</a>.</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/activision-9.png?resize=640%2C348&#038;ssl=1" alt="A drawing of Microsoft Game Pass" width="640" height="348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10158" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/activision-9.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/activision-9.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/activision-9.png?resize=1024%2C557&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/activision-9.png?resize=768%2C418&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/activision-9.png?resize=1159%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1159w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
  <h3 id="streaming">Streaming</h3>
  <p>This year saw a lot of upheavel in the streaming space; some of these outlooks have already came true (Netflix and ads), remain to be seen (Warner Bros. Discovery), or aren’t looking too good (consolidation may happen in streaming, but cable is looking like a weak player).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/why-netflix-should-sell-ads/">Why Netflix Should Sell Ads</a> — Netflix has been resolutely opposed to selling ads, prioritizing the user experience; however, the market conditions for streaming have changed, and so should Netflix.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/cables-last-laugh/">Cable’s Last Laugh</a> — Cable companies survived the great unbundling thanks to selling Internet service; they may be best place to make the bundle of the future.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/warner-bros-discovery/">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> — Warner Bros. Discovery is a company that makes a lot of sense, both because of its content and also its strategy, which treats streaming as an additional channel, not a reason-for-being. <em>See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/warner-bros-discovery-and-the-nba-the-zaslav-doctrine/">Warner Bros.

  <h3 id="tech-and-society">Tech and Society</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-current-thing/">The Current Thing</a> — If businesses are subject to Aggregation Theory, then so are ideas: this is the root of the “The Current Thing” meme, and it should drive a re-evaluation of how we think about moderating content on the Internet.</li>

  <h3 id="other-company-coverage">Other Company Coverage</h3>
