<p>I think it’s kinda like the <em>party culture</em> in the states, some guys actually hate it, but if you hate it you may be at the risk of losing some social lifes or even job opportunities so it’s meibanfa (party culture may be a bit better because you can have multiple choices)</p>

<p>Lots of young generation is meibanfa because they have to prepare well for stepping in the society and dealing with the old generation, college is a good place for them to practice, still sounds silly tho</p>

<p>The good news is that, younger generation is much better</p>

<p>Also, the south is better than the north and I’m glad that I live in the south (near HK)</p>

<p>—– <strong>451.1</strong> —–2019-07-08 10:11:29+08:00:</p>

<p>HK is still important as its global financial center to China</p>

<p>I don’t think SH can totally replace HK’s function due to the different system</p>

<p>—– <strong>451.2</strong> —–2019-07-08 11:56:29+08:00:</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter, man, SZ is the tech powerhouse</p>

<p>The only but non-replaceable function of HK nowadays is as global financial center to China, it’s the white glove of CCP from the free world</p>

<p>Btw I live besides HK and SZ, and my city is the same city scale</p>

<p>—– <strong>451.3</strong> —–2019-07-08 14:39:34+08:00:</p>

<p>bingo</p>

<p>—– <strong>451.4</strong> —–2019-07-08 14:50:32+08:00:</p>

<p>So is Shanghai, but the special advantage of HK is the <em>one country two systems</em>, which gives them an upper hand on information transparency, capital flexibility, and global connection and all of them are desired by International capital</p>

<p><em>one country two systems</em> is a deliberate system designed for not only further Taiwan unification but also HK capital system.</p>

<p>I cannot figure out the ccp internal report now but I remember they discussed the importance to keep the HK status to make the best use of its international financial center to get access to the free world resources</p>

<p>If HK fails, lots of MNCs and financial groups may move their AS-PAC HQ to SGP but not SH (heavily depends on the ongoing trade war tho)</p>

<p>Yea I live in GZ</p>

<p>—– <strong>451.5</strong> —–2019-07-08 14:53:53+08:00:</p>

<p>Are you talking about the ongoing protest? Yea sure until forcing Chinese central government to step in directly, therefore ccp is trying to avoid and keep the riots being controllable by the local government</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m a completist and infinite modifications on iPad allow me to start my notes easily</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>College courses are always flexible, the knowledge is huge with random construction (especially if you have an awful professor). So the flexibility of digital notes fit this case perfectly. You can add/remove page, rearrange inks, etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you search online, it’s easy for you to add the images, screenshot, and even the whole webpage to your notes without wasting your time to copy and draw.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides digital notes, I read and annotate the textbooks directly on my iPad and it’s extremely convenient and quick. If you have to write homework on iPad then just open the annotated textbooks on your Mac with seamless sync so the limited screen is not a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review your notes wherever you are (cafe/restroom/road) and whenever you are (probably go back after several semesters)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other fancy functions such as voice recording on NB and so on but I personally don’t use them a lot</p>

<p>Actually iPad digital notes are not only convenient but make me love taking notes somehow which I couldn’t image several years ago. I enjoy study more than before</p>

<p>Actually Microsoft’s tablet ecosystem is still not as strong as Apple’s IMO, including the apps and integration</p>

<p>Not saying SFP4 is that awful, but at least for me, after using both of them, iPad+Mac remains the upper hand</p>

<p>I bought SFP4 because I wanted to combine my tablet with laptop, but actually it’s kinda dumb when I have to take notes and search information at the same time (split-view is not enough)</p>

<p>SFP4’s pen with unstable head is another big con</p>

<p>tbh to maximize the production I’d like equipping Mac with iPad and use VM if necessary</p>

<p>I was a big fan of OneNote (I owned an SFP5) but now I switch to iPad and feel better, the only function I miss for OneNote is that you can add extra room everywhere but it’s not a big deal. Infinite paper also has both its pros and cons and I end up loving A4 digital paper because it’s more intuitionistic and convenient when I hand-in my assignments. The other thing SFP annoying me is the pen with unstable head</p>

<p>Go back to iPad topic, to me, the notes apps are <strong>Notability</strong> and <strong>Goodnotes</strong>, you can open auto-backup linked with other clouds as PDF so that you can have a PDF view of your notes seamlessly on your laptop (both NB and GN4 has this function, GN5 is working on it). btw Notability also provided a Mac version</p>

<p>Also, the PDF apps must be <strong>PDF Expert</strong>, equipped with <strong>Documents</strong> (filesystem), where I just open the textbooks on clouds and annotate them directly. I strongly recommend you to download all the Readdle apps including the two I mentioned here, their intergation is the best!</p>

<p>Last, you can buy an paper-like protector to enhance the writing experience</p>

<p>—– <strong>454.2</strong> —–2019-07-10 05:56:00+08:00:</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>If AI-manuf works in the foreseeable future, the most unfortunate countries should be the undeveloped countries and small developing countries but not China and India</p>

<p>You’d better check the STEM brains and AI-related industries in China, man</p>

<p>China is too big, the large pool of uneducated workers sometimes eclipses the relative advanced parts but you should not overlook it</p>

<p>China, following the US, would be the largest winners in this game. Given the large amount of mature engineers, huge consumer markets, established transportation system and less importance of labor cost due to the rise of AI, some, if not large, manufacturing will move back to the relatively advanced countries.</p>

<p>Actually I would worry more about China’s future considering the hyper-aging population if the AI-manuf doesn’t come that fast</p>

<p>—– <strong>456.2</strong> —–2019-07-10 14:16:46+08:00:</p>

<p>This is a classic argument, and it really depends on which one you’re comparing to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You seem to be saying that the quantity of engineers, people and transportation in China is an advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing to US, probably not that advantageous, I mentioned it, but when it comes to any other big countries, I see no one can surpass (but may be still at abreast)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps it is. However, quality will always be better than quantity. If I have 100 engineers working for me and they invent an average of 5 new inventions a year. While you have 1000 engineers that produce 0 inventions a year. Who has the advantage? […]
The simple fact is that massive numbers of engineers have been working in China for decades. Yet, the number of inventions from China is almost nonexistent. While having tons of engineers may seem like an advantage. Paying all those engineers, while not getting any new technology in return. Is a terrible investment. […] Many engineers + No inventions = waste of money</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Invention is a slow process, man. Check the pattern how the Germany caught up the UK in the 19 century and how Japan caught up the US in the 20 century. All of them are from copycats and reversed engineering turned out to be innovation leaders. Put down the suspicion of IP violation and evil regime scenario here, Huawei is the 5G leader, Ali Cloud is the 4th in the world, Tencent and Bytedance are good at business level innovations, DJI is the dominator of drone market, Xiaomi is not that tech-advantageous now but still growing up fast. Not to mention other AI-leading companies such as <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/artificial-intelligence-top-startups/">Baidu, SenseTime, HiSilicon, YITU Tech, 4Paradigm, Face++, iFLYTEK and so on</a>. Since we are talking about Manuf-AI here, so I just list the related companies. On the top-ranked AI papers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265230/china-is-about-to-overtake-america-in-ai-research">here is a diagram to show the quality of Chinese engineers</a>. I realize there are so many flaws in China system but I don’t think it’s zero innovation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good example of this is the UK. China has 21x the population of the UK. However, the Chinese economy only produces 5x the GDP of the UK. Meaning that if the UK had the same population as China. Their GDP would be 50 trillion a year(China GDP 15 trillion)!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sick that people compare China to other non-big countries, UK is not small, but still not a suitable country compared with China. Can I say the GDP per capita of Luxembourg is much higher than the US so it’s more advanced? Don’t get me wrong. I’m not implying that China is more advanced than the UK, but clearly it’s very hard for China to catch up other not-that-big advanced countries on GDP per capita, otherwise China at that time will be much more powerful that the US. Really, a country of 1/5 global population can win the UK on GDP per capita? That’s the god’s power. The US is an exception because the US is built based on the global system and has accumulated its power for two centuries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In regards to the huge consumer market. China has always had a very large population. The size of the market in China was also massive from 1950-1979. How many countries were selling products in China during that time? No one had access to the Chinese market during that period. Little has changed since then. […] The idea that anyone has complete access to the Chinese economy is nonsense. Even companies with access are limited or have to hand over technology and IP for the limited access. Many companies are banned. Google, Facebook, Youtube, Snapchat, Instagram, Reddit, etc. Which is why so many companies are leaving China.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, here I’m talking about the status quo, a mature middle class market. Also, here I’m talking about the pervasive manufacturing industry which will be impacted by AI-Manuf heavily but not the AI industry companies themselves. I understand that there are HUGE potential in other countries such as India and I didn’t deny it. My point is some undeveloped countries which are expected to benefit in the end of this century from the wave of global industrial transfer which traces extreme low labor cost and they may be impacted by the ongoing AI-Manuf at that time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Established transportation systems are cheaper than establishing transportation systems. However, roads, trucks, trains, boats, airports, airplanes and ports are all very old technology. They can literally be built anywhere by any country. They just need money. Not much of an advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they are. But still not that easy coming to the policy and other factors. For example, an electricity system is low tech, but a pervasive, comprehensive, and consistent electricity system is another issue. It’s true that majority countries must be end up upgrading their infrastructure system but the time table is a question. Lots of them are not only about technology but other systematic factors such as bribe, environment issues, and so on. CCP is kinda evil in some aspects, but if we focus on the infrastructure effect, CCP shortened the upgrading process successfully by heavily policy and capital investment and other cruel methods such as force demolition of citizen houses.</p>

<p>Also, the theory that all countries will keep going forward is a fairy tale. Not to mention the Middle Income Trap that lots of countries including China are still struggling in it, let say SEA. SEA is a hot topic nowadays because it and India seems to be the next China but actually lots of them were supposed to be manufacturing powerhouse last century but had been interrupted by 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Lots of countries degraded a lot such as Argentina, South Africa, some ME and SEA countries and so on. There are many black swans waiting on the road, no matter on economic, infrastructure, or any other aspect.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, I’m not arguing that all the manufacturing industry will keep staying in China, nor did I say China will surpass some advanced countries.</p>

<p>TL;DR The manufacturing industry will keep transferring to the low cost areas, but it doesn’t mean all these areas will definitely get this free lunch. The rising of AI-Manuf may impact them negatively and benefits the countries with well-prepared AI-Manuf techs such as the US and China. The undeveloped countries, rather than China, should worry more about AI-Manuf if it comes too fast.</p>

<p>—– <strong>456.3</strong> —–2019-07-12 07:01:56+08:00:</p>

<p>oh man you are a bit picky. So, the AI papers and other factors should not be regarded as the potential possibility of China’s <del>innovation</del> invention? I don’t know why someone would think the inventions will not happen if the innovations insides a country are increasing, because invention is the highest level of innovation. A country accumulated the capital, experience, and brains in the process of low-end foundry and then climbed the value chain step by step and it should be for decades. China actually opened its door to capitalism in <del>1978</del> 1992. Actually I’ve already given credits to your current argument, because in the second comment you said <em>no invention is a waste of money</em> but actually lots of China tech giants nowadays are making money both at home and abroad. They don’t have high-level tech innovation (i.e. invention), but have other business model innovations (Ali/Tencent/…) and low-level tech innovations (DJI/Huawei/…). Also, the first one who created something cannot guarantee that he can make huge money from it. Your QR code example is a perfect counterexample to your argument. So, now here is a question to <del>China</del> Japan: is inventing QR code first but not that successful in earning profit a big WASTE of money?</p>

<p>Not to forget that, we were talking about AI-Manuf, therefore I gave some AI-related examples which are the top field in contemporary technology. Actually China invention on some fields are not that bad, for example high-speed rail and <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/china-s-quantum-satellite-achieves-spooky-action-record-distance">quantum satellite and communication</a></p>

<p>The rising of systematic complexity of invention means that the 21 century is not like 19 or 20 century, when a person like Edison can invent tons of stuffs. Nowadays, a team of hundreds of scientists may just works for years to enhance a component of supercomputer, like China’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight">Sunway supercomputer</a> which once was the fastest one in the world (now was took back by the US) but you cannot deny that it’s not a huge progress.</p>

<p>The global cooperation system means that MNCs will set their R&amp;D HQ worldwide and the university will cooperate with each other. Otherwise, do you think the inventions from foreign scientists working in the US colleges should be counted for the US invention or not? IMO letting the market speak is the simplest and probably fair method, if the market buys it, then it’s a success.</p>

<p>You compare China with Japan and Germany and just reflect the fact that you have NO CLUE what’s happened in the last two centuries, i.e. the Industrial Revolution. Both Japan and Germany not only completed their industrialization but also became the top players of the world platform or they wouldn’t have the ability to start WWII. China, whose industrialization was interrupted by the Sino-Japan war during ROC, restarted this process after the establishment of PRC. Germany and Japan, as the highly industrialized countries, even if without the aid of Marshall Plan and Korean War respectively, could still recover fast after the war, because their people were not destroyed. For instance, even there is a meteorite attacking and destroying every physical building in the US tomorrow, the US would recover super fast because the highly modern, civilized, and industrialized people are still there.</p>

<p>—– <strong>456.4</strong> —–2019-07-12 23:40:20+08:00:</p>

<p>Well, I think, I’m talking about the <em>tendency</em>, while you’re picky about the current results</p>

<p>Your arguments are fair and give me some information I didn’t realize, which I appreciate</p>

<p>But at the same time, I don’t think it hurts my argument in the big picture</p>

<p>Your definition of <em>invention</em> sounds like it must be comprised of the wholly new components</p>

<p>IDK man, not to mention the saying, <em>standing on the shoulders of giants</em></p>

<p>If we follow your definition of invention</p>

<p>Watt’s steam engine was not an invention because it’s derived from the reciprocating motion one but it did help GB to lead the first industrial revolution.</p>

<p>The US’s satellite was not an invention because the first one, as you said, was from USSR but it did help the US in the space race.</p>

<p>The US’s long-range missile was not an invention because the fist one was Germany V2 rocket but it did help the US maintain the military hegemony.</p>

<p>The possible inventions in this century with the impacts being abreast of Internet and steam engine that come to my mind should be <em>strong AI</em> and <em>controllable nuclear fusion</em>, but I guess you would deny them as inventions again, because they are from <em>weak AI</em> and <em>nuclear energy</em> respectively.</p>

<hr />

<p>I didn’t accept your argument is not because some nationalist arrogance shit. NO. I’m open-minded. I just cannot accept it from the logic</p>

<p>—– <strong>456.5</strong> —–2019-07-13 00:13:45+08:00:</p>

<p>Sigh, so you are still stuck at the definition of invention</p>

<p>Don’t you forget what’s our topic? The AI-Manuf and whether China can prepare for it well, and I brought the fact that China’s technology is rising so the undeveloped countries may be impacted more negatively while China may actually gets benefit from it</p>

<p>Then you keep saying that why China has no invention and therefore it’s a waste of money, which is not directly related to our topic. Watt’s steam engine, was not an invention but still benefited GB a lot, so are other innovations in China nowadays.</p>

<p>I was not saying China is NO 1 in controlled nuclear fusion and AI, just want to mention that, based on your logic with highly focus on invention itself, you may ignore the importance of innovation, , such as coming controlled nuclear fusion and strong AI, which can also make huge impacts</p>

<p>In short, <strong>innovation is not always weaker than invention itself</strong> especially if we focus on economy and power, though I agree that from the perspective of mankind, invention is far more important because it’s the real progress</p>

<p>I didn’t say that.</p>

<p>The lists I gave above are just to prove that, <em>on the social influence and economy power</em> (our original topic), the ones who benefit most (a lot) are not always (only) the inventors themselves, I did realize there are tons of inventions have been and still are happening in the world especially in the states</p>

<p>I’m still writing the next comment, man, such as long post</p>

<p>—– <strong>456.10</strong> —–2019-07-13 21:43:20+08:00:</p>

<p>It seems that you are from the US (if not, plz correct me) and keep using the US to compare China. I noticed it from the start so I’ve mentioned it several times in my previous comments that I’m focusing on the less-developed country but not the US, I mentioned that China is still far behind the US, like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>China, following the US, [blablabla]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but it seems that you didn’t realize or just ignored it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The list you gave me shows social influence and economic power in Mainland China and mainland China only. Since things like Baidu, Wechat, Ali or JD.com. Are only popular in China</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is enough for the current development and actually a great progress comparing to 10 years ago, when all the powerful companies in China were foreign companies. The domestic companies growing from beating the foreign counterparts at home to spreading oversea sounds pretty natural to me. TikTok earns the endorsement from the western generation Z. Aliexpress (not Taobao or Tianmao) has an influence in the world especially in Russia and SEA. You can download the app to see whether there are some European and American using it.</p>

<p>These companies are actually the foundations for innovation or even invention. Because if you desire deeper innovation and, as you said, precise invention, then you must have the capital, experience, brains, and resources <em>at first</em>. Now, assume you are the president of a country, would you prefer, China, with tier-II but at least functioning tech giants, or India and other countries, whose domestic markets are being occupied by the US companies and brains being absorbed to the US?</p>

<p>If you think it’s not enough, go to ask the European that whether they’re jealous about China having the tech giants while there is no such a one in the Europe (sometimes I visit r/Europe). Nowadays more and more European are questioning that whether they should open the free market to the US because the personal data, while it’s free, is actually the most valuable resource in the age of AI. The US tech giants are exploiting the European resources, from the personal data to tech powerhouses such as deep mind. Now, at least China has 1.3b data to feed the DL and AI algorithms and has a set of tech giants to nurture the endemic brains.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are only popular in China. Almost no one outside of China even knows who these companies are. Go to America and ask anyone if they know who Tencent, Baidu or Alibaba is. 99.9999% of people will say “who?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you come from the US does impair your feeling of reality of the third world because you stand too high. You are standing on the top of mountain, then of course you cannot feel the wind at the foot of mountain. When there is a wind, it blows from the foot to the top, and the US must be the last one to feel it or probably cannot feel it if the wind is not strong enough. But it never means the wind doesn’t exist. If you want to feel the wind, you’d better climb down a bit, like visiting the Europe, SEA, ME, and even Africa. But tbh, although it’s true, your description of 99.9% here is definitely exaggerated because it didn’t fit my experience in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You keep speaking about invention as if it is a natural progression. It’s not. It needs to be nurtured and regulated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great point and that’s the next stage of development where China should be. There is a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_income_trap">Middle Income Trap</a> and China is fighting on it. Although it’s a wider concept, it has great relationship with regulation and innovation because if a country want to overcome this obstacle, it must enhance its efficiency of production which requires the things you and me mentioned here.</p>

<p>However, regulation is also a kind of progress. It’s impossible that, a group of uneducated people, who suffered a lot from the cultural revolution and starvation, suddenly know what’s regulation and obey the laws, all of them want to do in these decades is to make money. You may see the bad reputation of Chinese tourist at home and abroad, and that’s because these uneducated people get rich too fast. The younger generations are still far from perfect, but at least lots of them are educated and grow up in a good environment, they love clear regulation rather than vague guanxi, they prefer to buy official digital products to support the musicians and developers and they are more willing to use law to defend their rights.</p>

<p>As a person growing up in China, I know how bad the IP environment was in China. But some western medias say it’s a CCP deliberate policy is kinda stupid too. IMO it’s more like a natural process of the people awareness, if not, you can visit other third world countries and compare them. The only similar thing from CCP I’ve read is a book of Wang Huning (China’ Kissinger, now #5 member of the standing committee of the political bureau) saying that (roughly translation)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Teaching them laws is like teaching them the to play basketball, you cannot force the law strictly at the beginning, you should use the law and let the people get use to it year by year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know whether it’s rational or not, but at least, the creepy IP environment of China nowadays, is more a stage of development, rather than a deliberate trap the CCP made to steal technology.</p>

<p>Of course, it hard for China to have a real law system because there’s no independent rule of law under CCP leadership but in my eyes, at least in the non-political fields such as the IP issues, still far away from perfect but the things are getting better and better.</p>

<hr />

<p>btw I go back to think again, I still think you’re a bit picky about the word <em>invention</em>, or in other words, it’s probably you but not us, treating the China propaganda too seriously. For example, you may know there’s a saying, <em>four new inventions</em>, include high-speed rails, e-commerce, sharing bikes, and blablabla. This description is just an analogy to the <em>old four inventions</em> and that’s all. Chinese are proud of them because they’re some innovations finally from the China companies. Yes, they’re minor innovations, business-level innovations, and built on other existing projects, but still much better than 10 years ago, when all China domestic markets were dominated by foreign companies. That’s why, I emphasized, this endorsement is more for <em>tendency</em>, but not <em>status quo</em>. Sometimes we call them <em>inventions</em> but, really, that’s all. NONE of Chinese would think they’re at breast of some real inventions such as Internet, Mac, or satellite, unless you count the Chinese red necks who haven’t finished their high schools.</p>

<p>I have the same question, I desire a PDF view of my notes on laptop via iCloud but fails, I’m quite sure I can do it through PDF-view auto-backup with other clouds such as Onedrive and G-Drive on NB and GN4 (GN5 is still working on it)</p>

<p>AFAIK the iCloud syncing of GN means that you can sync the contents (different from the PDF-view auto-backup as above) among all the Apple devices but because they don’t have a Mac version app so it seems no way I can see my GN5 contents on Mac which is f**king annoying</p>

<p>Hope somebody else help me figure it out</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, you can still achieve your goal if using GN4 or NB</p>

<p>—– <strong>461.2</strong> —–2019-07-09 01:56:11+08:00:</p>

<p>actually if you don’t mind using GN4 or NB, it’s a better experience for view because your can use PDF app to see them with two or more pages at one glance while the official app such as NB Mac version is kinda dumb for view (good for typing tho)</p>

<p>the auto-backup should be seamless at least in the states so you can annotate notes on iPad with simultaneous show-up on your Mac screen</p>

<p>Although I’m native Chinese, I agree with you</p>

<p>I come from the T1 city and studied in the Top10 university in China (now I studied in the states). There are some cheating behaviors among my Chinese fellows in the Chinese colleges. They will calculate a lot to earn the best result. Not sure why we have this behavior, the culture or the aftermaths of cultural revolution, but I’m sure lots of them are <em>exquisite egoists</em>, and I was one of them.</p>

<p>Lots of cheating are deliberate such as copying assignments, getting the last year answer of the exam and writing scam papers. But some of them are unintentional. For example, the personal statement service companies for studying oversea and the collected previous problems of GRE, lots of them don’t know these behaviors are illegal because everyone is doing it. Just a shame. I didn’t notice these behaviors until I went to the states. (btw I’m the exchange student but not 4-year student so I didn’t do these things, I just didn’t realize them)</p>

<p>sorry man, not defending CCP, but if we just put down the ideology and just use the logic</p>

<p>Being against western ideas is not always being hostile to the west</p>

<p>Being against western ideas and spreading the anti-western ideas <em>are</em> being hostile to the west</p>

<p>You can say you don’t buy <em>States Capitalism</em> but cannot say the existence of it is against the west. Because the existence is passive, and spreading like USSR is active</p>

<p>Sounds like, <em>killing the infidel</em></p>

<p>Just a flaw of your logic, not the fact</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.2</strong> —–2019-07-12 08:54:31+08:00:</p>

<p>That’s the point. We don’t mind who governs both mainland and Taiwan, we just want to be united again. It’s sick that some guys vigorously support the Taiwan Independence. How can China not feel hostile about it?</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.3</strong> —–2019-07-12 08:58:26+08:00:</p>

<p>because some of the things you mentioned here sound like in the China’s sphere</p>

<p>Did China do anything bad like Cuba missile crisis like USSR in front of the US?</p>

<p>oh man, I meant Taiwan and South China Sea, not your lovely allies</p>

<p>I understand how the west hates authorization</p>

<p>But really, to most Chinese, we don’t mind who governs China, PRC, POR, Chinese Federation, whatever, we just want to keep the territory unification</p>

<p>It’s a difference between the regime and civilization</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.6</strong> —–2019-07-12 09:19:44+08:00:</p>

<p>First, I was just picky about the logic</p>

<p>Second, well, actually I was not saying <em>communism</em>, but the <em>States Capitalism</em></p>

<p>I believe there is a possibility that China can become more liberal one day, current China under XJP is the one I’m also against to</p>

<p>but I don’t think China will be the same as American model in my life from the realistic perspective</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.7</strong> —–2019-07-12 10:04:46+08:00:</p>

<p>OK, let’s be more clear, <em>China economic model</em>, a combination of state capitalism and free market capitalism</p>

<p>I know, there is also a saying that, SGP or/and Northern Europe is socialism, there are lots of mutation models nowadays, also, no counterpart of China model</p>

<p>Just call whatever you want to call, I think the main difference in this topic should be, whether the people feel a level of liberalism/freedom in the society, no matter which system they are using</p>

<p>Edit: just like, there was NO real communism and Marxism happened, because this theory has a huge bug</p>

<p>—– <strong>480.8</strong> —–2019-07-12 10:50:01+08:00:</p>

<p>a bit wrong</p>

<p>The China’s civil war is suspended but never ended</p>

<p>not to mention that one of the reasons the civil war didn’t end is the <strong>foreign intervention</strong></p>

<p>although it’s understandable that these things always happened in the Cold War just like SK and NK, it’s rational that the west wanted to stop the spreading of <del>authorization regime</del> commie (Taiwan was also authorization regime at that time so I change it)</p>

<p>it’s also not that hard to realize that lots of Chinese think it’s the west playing divide and conquer game on the China again from the civilization perspective but not regime perspective if you have a great ability of empathy</p>

<hr />

<p>Just like, what would you think, if some Europe hegemonies stepped in the US civil war and caused the status quo of independence, then sit there and laugh, haha, you must follow the International law defined by us and keep the status quo or we would beat you?</p>

<p>XJP is definitely a black swan in the eyes of no matter international community or native Chinese. His hawkish behaviors are also being attacked within China and CCP.</p>

<p>However, on the Xinjiang issue, it has less relationship with XJP as you thought. AFAIK, it’s because dating back to 2005, a small group of Uyghur elites, who were released in Hu Yaobang’s era under the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshaoyikuan">Liangshaoyikuan</a>, inculcated the Uyghur separatism thought in the Uyghurchu textbook. The Chinese government didn’t figure out until 15 years later and turned out to be the Xinjiang camps. I believe even if there was a dovish ccp leader, he would also choose to rule with iron.</p>

<p>The 4th president, Hu Jintao, had a nickname called <em>The Tiger of Lhasa</em> because he oppressed the Tibet riots. The 3rd president, Jiang Zemin, oppressed Falungong with thousands of 610 offices (I understand this tho). Not to mention the 2nd one, Deng Xiaoping, the prime factor of the TAM event, and the 1st one, Mao Zedong, leading the cultural revolution.</p>

<p>Well, but of course, XJP is the most ambitious leader after 1978 and stupid enough to remove the presidential term.</p>

<p>On one hand, the west will be more hostile to China because they are at odds over universal values plus the rising of Chinese authorization regime</p>

<p>On the other hand, most China people don’t buy these stuffs and if China want to have a deeper global influence in both hard power and soft power, then they must seek a powerful thought but not just the outmoded propaganda</p>
