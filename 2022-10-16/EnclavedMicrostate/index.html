<p>Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth">rules concerning the scope of questions</a>. However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.</p>

<p>So for example, if you wanted to ask, “<em>Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?</em>” we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask “<em>In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?</em>” we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians">please reach out to us for assistance</a>.</p>

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the genocidal action must take a substantial toll on its target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Define ‘substantial’, because wherever you draw the line, <em>someone</em> will find <em>some event</em> that is <em>just shy</em> and ask why that arbitrarily doesn’t count.</p>

<p>Or rather, the key thing is that genocide is about intentions and not about scope.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not enough to prove that there have been cases of forced sterilization because, guess what, there’s been cases of forced sterilizations of Han women too, China is shitty to all of its people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, even beyond the sterilisations, the evidence for specific targeting of Uighurs and Kazakhs (as the principal representatives of Turkic Muslim groups) is extremely clear: there has been overt settlement of Han Chinese people in Xinjiang to out-populate the indigenous population, <em>only</em> Turkic-speakers and Muslims have been placed in concentration camps, there is active suppression of non-Mandarin languages and Islam, including the destruction of mosques, etc. It’s not like China is also trying to force Han Chinese people to drop Mandarin or blowing up Confucian sites at the same time that it’s suppressing Uighur and Kazakh and demolishing mosques.</p>

<p>But on the sterilisation point, that there may be individual sterilisations of Han women does not change the broad trend, that being <a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/abortion-china">antinatalism towards Uighurs and Kazakhs and pronatalism towards Han women</a>, in which reproductive autonomy is curtailed <em>in general</em>, but in distinct ways with different populations, towards ends that are unavoidably eugenicist in nature.</p>

<p>—– <strong>874.1</strong> —–2022-10-12 14:15:01+08:00:</p>

<p>So, there is actually a <em>lot</em> of English-language scholarship on the Taiping both in absolute terms and in contextual – compared to basically any other 20-year period in Chinese history (at least before the 20th century), it is <em>incredibly</em> well-studied in many respects. <em>However</em> only a portion of that makes it out into published monograph form, rather than languishing as unpublished doctoral theses or theoretically accessible but often obscure journal articles. And then only a portion of <em>that</em> is general overview and/or narrative history rather than specialist studies aimed at a broadly academic readership. But, not to fear – it’s why I’m here.</p>

<p>In terms of narrative histories, there are four main options to consider: Franz Michael and Chung-li Chang’s <em>The Taiping Rebellion, Volume I</em> (1966), Jen Yu-Wen’s <em>The Taiping Revolutionary Movement</em> (1973), Jonathan Spence’s <em>God’s Chinese Son</em> (1996), and Stephen R. Platt’s <em>Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom</em> (2012).</p>

<p>Michael and Chang’s book isn’t as problematic as one might fear from its considerable age. Taiping scholarship has only really gone through perhaps one noticeable paradigm shift since then, focussed more or less entirely on the framing and interpretation of Taiping Christianity, which is very important obviously but which I don’t think fundamentally undermines Michael and Chang’s narrative. In a broader sense however, the late 80s onwards also saw a shift towards much greater recognition of ethnic dynamics in the Qing period writ large, and that’s something that is especially noticeable by its absence in the older work.</p>

<p>Jen’s book is prohibitively expensive, a bit dry, and overtly moralising, but it is also the most comprehensive chronology in English, and critically it gives coverage to a number of side theatres that most narratives disregard. This is what you read, <em>if you have every intention of becoming a Taiping specialist</em>. I bring this one up, however, because this book had a significant impact on the next two, which explicitly, if briefly, note that they are only going to offer a partial coverage, precisely because the complete chronology had already been offered by Jen back in the 70s.</p>

<p>Spence’s book puts religion at the front and centre of the Taiping movement, and primarily follows the perspective of Hong Xiuquan. The result of this is a fascinating narrative that explains how Hong Xiuquan’s belief system emerged and in turn took hold within the religious environment of mid-19th century south China. However, these emphases also serve as its limitations: after covering the coups and purges of 1856 that gutted the Taiping leadership for the remainder of the decade, Spence’s coverage of the wider Taiping conflict becomes somewhat scattershot as he comes to focus mostly on Hong Xiuquan himself and his religious writings while isolated in his royal palace. The climactic phase of the conflict thus lies largely undiscussed, or at least very impressionistically.</p>

<p>Platt’s book effectively picks up where Spence leaves off, and heretical as it may be among Sinologists for me to say this, his book manages to be even better written. Platt’s approach is informed quite a bit by the field of global history, and his Taiping War is thus not only situated in the context of the Qing Empire, but also the wider diplomatic and commercial environment of the Pacific amidst the Second Opium War and the American Civil War. That does not mean he is writing a massive comparative history, but rather that connectedness and connectivity is given an extremely prominent role, alongside the largely domestic narrative covering the Taiping reform attempts under Hong Rengan, and the Qing counteroffensive campaigns under Zeng Guofan. But Platt’s narrative is not totally comprehensive: when it comes to the war’s ‘eastern theatre’, he focusses almost exclusively on Jiangsu with very little mention of the campaigning in Zhejiang, amid a general sidelining of the French from the narrative (albeit likely for linguistic reasons); he also, as noted, chooses to start things <em>in medias res</em> in 1859, and while he does an extremely good job bringing the reader up to speed on what is relevant, one may ask whether something might be lost in not considering longer-term continuities within the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>

<p>I would suggest that if you’re trying to understand the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as a religious phenomenon, then read Spence. If you’re trying to understand the Taiping War as an event in the context of wider global history, then read Platt. If you’re trying to get a start-to-finish narrative, read both.</p>

<p>I’ll also throw up some of the more specialist pieces if you want to dig into some more specific aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tobie Meyer-Fong, <em>What Remains</em> (2013) – A harrowing work discussing the civilian experience and commemoration of the Taiping War.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carl Kilcourse, <em>Taiping Theology</em> (2017) – Pretty self-explanatory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chuck Wooldridge, <em>City of Virtues</em> (2016) – Not about the Taiping as such, but rather a history of Nanjing and its place in literary space, with one chapter devoted to the Taiping years and another to the post-Taiping reconstruction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prosper Giquel, Stephen Leibo, <em>A Journal of the Chinese Civil War, 1864</em> (1985) – A translation with commentary of one of the journals of the French naval officer Prosper Giquel, who organised and occasionally commanded the Franco-Chinese Corps of Zhejiang between 1862 and 1864. It’s preceded by a brisk but still reasonably detailed narrative history of the Franco-Chinese Corps and its antecedents, which serves as one of the only English-language writings on French involvement in the Taiping conflict.</p>

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I mean, that isn’t really true of Xenophon, who was hardly anti-democratic nor some major Athenian flag-waver. But then again, he’s also <em>very</em> realistic about Spartan military ability in the <em>Hellenika</em>, so… make of that what you will.</p>

<p>Yeah sure, but not an anti-democrat by any means. You’ve subtly shifted the goalposts here – we <em>do</em> have Athenian voices who give a realistic rather than a romantic view of Sparta.</p>

<p>Last week’s thread (or the week before) saw a bit of discussion around the new Kenneth Branagh Poirot films, and one user asked why <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> keeps being the one adapted instead of <em>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</em>, which is an interesting enough question that I had a bit of a musing over. I suspect the answer is very simply that the nature of the twist works for the former much more easily on film. The main twist of <em>Orient Express</em>, that being that &gt;!the murder was carried out by <em>all twelve</em> of the other passengers besides Poirot, the doctor, Bouc, and Elena!&lt;, transfers easily to film because of the way the information is presented: you find things out as Poirot and Dr. Constantine do, and so the eventual reveal doesn’t rely on telling you that any prior information is outright <em>wrong</em>, even if there were some red herrings. By contrast, <em>Roger Ackroyd</em> relies on Dr. Sheppard, the book’s own narrator, not mentioning &gt;!what he does in the ten minutes between Ackroyd receiving the letter at 8:40 and Sheppard leaving the office at 8:50, why he took 10 minutes to leave Fernly rather than 5, what exactly he did in the office after the body was discovered, and why he went to the Three Boars afterward (which he doesn’t even tell us as it happens; he only admits to it when he is asked about it the next day).!&lt; Because of that, the impact of the discovery that &gt;!Sheppard did it!&lt; relies on the POV character missing out information by not writing it down as it happens. That’s a lot harder to transfer to film, and I’m unsurprised that ITV opted for a more conventional whodunnit format in their adaptation, even if I’m disappointed they didn’t try. There are plenty of unreliable narrator films of course, but with films you aren’t looking literally through the POV character’s eyes. That kind of missing info probably comes off more as contrivance by the filmmaker than an in-character decision or mistake like it would be in a narrated novel.</p>

<p>Anyway, just some thoughts.</p>

<p>—– <strong>882.3</strong> —–2022-10-18 00:06:28+08:00:</p>

<p>Robert Ackroyd, brother of the more famously murdered Roger.</p>

<p>CRWBY is the fandom term for the production crew, and yes, it is ‘crewby’.</p>

<p>—– <strong>882.5</strong> —–2022-10-19 01:00:29+08:00:</p>

<p>So, out of sheer curiosity, which of Singapore’s 4+ main languages was the dub done in?</p>

<p>—– <strong>882.6</strong> —–2022-10-19 03:28:12+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They did actually adapt The Murder of Roger Ackroyd!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know, and as noted, I suspect the difficulty of adapting the twist to film was what led them to instead choose the safer (read: more cowardly) option of a more conventional whodunnit story.</p>

<p>—– <strong>882.7</strong> —–2022-10-22 07:14:31+08:00:</p>

<p>Sure, but I don’t even think that’s what Malleon was saying – the issue was <em>agreeing</em> to hire her.</p>

<p>—– <strong>882.8</strong> —–2022-10-22 07:15:12+08:00:</p>

<p>That’s what got me – if Delutaya’s timeline is accurate, Mikeneko’s insinuations would have been around the time Delu debuted her Live2D model, and surely far from coincidental.</p>
