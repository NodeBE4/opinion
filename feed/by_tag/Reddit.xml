<p>Alternatively, if you didn’t mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the ‘Short Answers’ thread would be “Who won the 1932 election?” or “What are some famous natural disasters from the past?”.

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>A book which I’m surprised has not been brought up by anyone here so far is Scott Levi’s <em>The Bukharan Crisis</em> (2020), which, in brief, <em>demolishes</em> the concept of the ‘Silk Road’ pretty comprehensively. He builds on Hansen to some extent, but his main thrust is that the entire concept of a ‘Silk Road’ is Orientalist scholarship trying to assign special significance to Sino-European overland trade that it fundamentally didn’t have. From a Central Asian perspective, the notion that the region was historically subordinated to the whims of European demand for Chinese goods smacks of a certain sedentary-centrism, and also blatantly ignores Central Asia’s considerable trade links with South Asia, which ‘Silk Road’ models of Eurasian trade flagrantly disregard. Granted, he’s coming at this from specifically an Early Modern standpoint, rather than the medieval one which ‘Silk Road’ discussions usually come framed in, but this too is, he notes, problematic – overland trade didn’t suddenly stop at some point, indeed it <em>intensified</em> as maritime links between Europe and Asia became strengthened. It’s been very influential on my own thinking and it’s why I pretty consistently try to put up big asterisks whenever a ‘Silk Road’ discussion comes up on the sub.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.2</strong> —–2023-04-01 17:10:09+08:00:</p>

<p>I can’t speak for anyone but myself, but it was definitely not a slow read for me! Also, unlike a lot of books, it actually has the footnotes <em>on the page</em>, which means you get all of the little snarky comments…</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.3</strong> —–2023-04-01 17:13:30+08:00:</p>

<p>Speaking from a Qing perspective, the Qing did appropriate Chinese dynastic historiographical orthodoxy to a great extent, primarily though not exclusively within China. For instance, it’s notable that in the 1790s, the Qianlong Emperor cited both the Yuan and Ming states as (negative) historical exemplars in justifying increased oversight over succession to office within the Tibetan clergy. But for the most part, the appropriation of Chinese historiographical orthodoxy applied <em>within China proper</em>, rather than in Inner Asia. So the modern Chinese appeal to the dynastic succession is based on a different interpretation of that succession than the Mongols and the Manchus would have understood.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.4</strong> —–2023-04-01 19:43:47+08:00:</p>

<p>So, to address the three in turn:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>network</em> is not defined by a single directional interaction. If you’re trying to describe a <em>network</em> based on the movement of a single commodity in a single direction, you are not describing the network as a whole, you are describing a feature of the network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By focussing on a single commodity in a single direction, you are <em>no longer talking about the network</em>. You are, to put it another way, talking <em>over</em> the network. You are <em>choosing</em> to make Europe and Asia the absentee protagonists of Central Asian history.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By emphasising the ‘Silk Road’ specifically, you <em>aren’t looking at the network</em>, because the land trade network and the sea trade network were parts of the same fundamental network.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If I were to summarise the narrative thrust here, it’s that the ‘Silk Road’ is not the story of a network, it is a cherry-picked story taken from a network, that actively elides the rest of the network by asserting the primacy of that specific story within it.</p>

<p>I also feel I must also overrule /u/DanKensington slightly because the name is also problematic. It’s a name coined by a German in the 1890s to describe a particular route described in a particular source, that was then conflated out to a wide variety of contexts well beyond what that original German was going for, as noted in the linked post.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.5</strong> —–2023-04-01 21:51:12+08:00:</p>

<p>Precisely. There’s nothing special about the ‘Silk Road’ within medieval Eurasia, let alone within the broader spatial and temporal scope of human history.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1165.6</strong> —–2023-04-01 23:27:46+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess to me using the overland silk trade between Europe and China as a shorthand to describe the exchange as a whole is akin to using, I dunno, the transatlantic slave trade to represent slavery in the early-modern period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m going to push back on this point, because it isn’t even comparable from a scale perspective. The coincidental movement of luxury goods from east to west across Central Asia was not even the largest component of Central Asian trade. For a glib analogy it’d be like saying Paris is particularly significant for being on the rail line from Calais to Marseille. It <em>is</em> on the rail line from Calais to Marseilles, but that linkage is hardly the defining feature that makes Paris what it is. The discarding of the ‘Silk Road’ is being proposed in order to actually understand the multifaceted relationships between Central Asia as a region and its neighbours, rather than centring its history away towards entities at its fringe.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1167.1</strong> —–2023-04-01 08:50:34+08:00:</p>

<p>This is a surprisingly rich story, involving three court ministers, Ping, Pong, and Pang, in the time of the emperor Altoum. Now, Altoum is not exactly a very Chinese name, and there is a reason for that – the events in question took place during the short-lived Western Yi Dynasty, a brief and obscure period principally known through the private chronicle of 普只尼, established by an Inner Asian tribe of uncertain origin. Like many states in China founded by Inner Asian polities, the ruling dynasty in turn found itself at threat from the steppe that it had left behind, as new tribes emerged to fill the gap. By Altoum’s time, this was becoming dire, as the collapse of the Tartarian Empire of Tamerlane had created fierce competition in the steppe that threatened to spill into his territories, and the emperor struggled with the problem of how to explain to these roaming nomads that his nice neat border was not to be traversed.</p>

<p>It was around this time that Ping, Pong, and Pang were working on the development of a new sport that could be played in a limited space. In its first iteration, three players would circle around a round table carrying frying pans, which they would use to hit a ball across the table between them. A pass was only valid if the ball bounced once, but if it missed the table or bounced twice, the player who had just attempted to pass had lost, and the player who had last passed to them had won.</p>

<p>This was deemed somewhat unwieldy, and so gradually there was a shift towards wooden paddles for convenience, followed by a more radical step of replacing the round table with a rectangular one with a net across the middle, and changing the game to one of two players. Pang, unfortunately, tended to be the one left to referee at the side. This was to have rather unfortunate consequences in the long term, but more immediately, when the game was completed, Ping and Pong chose to publicise the game without crediting Pang. Henceforth, it was to be known as The Game of Ping and Pong, or merely Ping-Pong for short.</p>

<p>But Ping appears not to have reckoned that his connivance with Pong would later backfire on him. Pong had come to discover the remarkable bounciness of steel against steel, and privately developed his own variant of Ping-Pong in a small frame, with one sliding block on each side that would be used to deflect a steel ball, initially actuated using a springloaded mechanism. Pong then took his invention to the court without Ping, presenting it as The Game of Pong, which he invited the emperor to try.</p>

<p>As the game progressed, however, Altoum noted that it was odd that there was a line across the middle of the Pong board, that seemed to serve no useful purpose. He had, however, heard rumours of a Game of Ping and Pong where the table had a central net that could catch the ball mid-flight, and was curious about whether that had influenced the line’s inclusion. Sensing possible danger should he give the wrong answer, Pong improvised: the point of the Game of Pong was not merely sport, but indeed a philosophical tool, intended to teach the lesson that the mere drawing of a line does not, in itself, affect the physical world.</p>

<p>This proved to be an apt statement, as Altoum appears to have had a eureka moment at that point, realising that the mere existence of a border would not stop raiding; he needed to actively prohibit movement. He needed to build a wall. And so it was that the Game of Pong led to the construction of a (not quite <em>the</em>) great wall in northern China.</p>

<p>But there is, however, a tragicomic coda to all this. Pang, jilted by his former friends, stole Pong’s research into steel elasticity, and travelled into the steppe, where he made contact with the Muslim warlord A’Tari, bringing with him a proposal for a new siege engine. A steel ball, initially launched by a catapult, would be repeatedly reflected against a large steel plate, allowing a wall to slowly be worn down, brick by brick. Unfortunately, a lack of access to sufficient steel meant that in practice, instead of a plate large enough to reflect the ball consistently, there was instead a smaller plate that would have to be moved by gantry to meet the ball every time it bounced off the target wall. Any failure to intercept the ball as it rolled back could be fatal to the operators, and it was deemed that any more than three lives lost in this way meant the siege should be called off.</p>

<p>And so it was that Pang, the forgotten colleague of Ping and Pong, invented Breakout.</p>

<p>如果跳脱这个角度，谈监控的立意和环境，美国政府的监控，最终受内部法律和民意制约，它不可能消失，因为是一种安全需求，但制约能在公众所能意识到的范围内限制它。</p>

<p>中国政府的监控，更接近于一种维稳手段，这也是区别两者的最大差异。</p>

<p>中美政府的差别，很大程度在于其存在的理由不同，美国政府的更替来自于一套成熟制度，民众赋予权力，这也是制约权力的来源。</p>

<p>中国政府因为缺乏这种稳定的合法性来源，它的不稳定就加剧了不安全感，而一切能获得信息的途径，都只会被用于巩固其政权稳健。</p>

<p>两个政府存在的目的性差异之大，决定了其行为受控与否。</p>

<p>当然，我更多看法是，美国做错了，反贼不应该有心理负担，就大方批评，错了就是错了，要说的就该说。</p>

<p>不能因为是美国跟中国对立，是民主化国家就不去批判，那样才是坠入粉红自己都没意识到的逻辑陷阱，单纯变成了立场对立，陷入战略层面选择方案少的死胡同。</p>

<p>粉红批判，反贼就要比粉红更深刻的批判，走他们的路，把他们的路堵死，这样反过来，是否该批判中共的选择权，就要交到粉红手里，批判违他们本意，不批判无法交代于同样的事件。</p>

<p>毕竟反贼以美国为标准去对照中国，是为了改变中国，而不是为了单方面称赞美国，所以批判的自由能让中国境况更显突出。</p>

<p>再不济，拿来指桑骂槐，其他人也听得出来。</p>

<p>当然，大部分时候，粉红分为两类</p>

<p>第一类，意识不到中共的特性，认为中国跟美国英国日本无本质区别，这是天真。</p>

<p>第二类，能意识到中共是专制政权的特殊性，但还是要维护一切专制政策，这是坏。</p>

<p>对于第一种人，同样的逻辑是可以容易被理解的，反而能得到认同，或者迷惑。</p>

<p>对于第二种人，你这样说他知道是指桑骂槐，但也无从反驳，而且大概率一旦你开这个路线去批判，他们也无法跟随。</p>

<p>因为国内其实不允许讨论中共所处的社会定位是什么（一个统治为目的的专制集团）</p>

<p>所以出现了这类迷惑的认知盲区，也即第一种人的观点（国家跟其他国家没区别，既然如此，那这么做很公平）</p>

<p>而第二种人知道中共这种做法是为了维稳，美国也只是政治上的针对，但他自己肯定不会故意说出来。</p>

<p>那么我们就要找机会先把这种观点说出来，让大众人知道政府对社会的态度和定位区别，这种认知一旦建立起来，第二种人装糊涂的空间就很少了。</p>

<p>不过问题就在于，国内是不允许讨论的，所以给第二种人极大的生存空间，进而产生了更多第一种人。</p>

<p>墙外不同，应该多说，说清楚些，不过很多人反而陷入认知逻辑陷阱，要反对中共，就必须找美国当一个对立面，所以其他人不能骂美国，这也是不合理的。</p>

<p>工业化社会无可避免都会面临少子化，老龄化也不可避免，关键是如何提高人均消费和经济产出能力。</p>

<p>目前情况看是产业升级无望，内需消费社会无法建成，因此最关键的通过提高人均产值，来获取更多资源，对冲老龄化与少子化的方案，我看是拿不出来了。</p>

<p>可能未来5-7年就是最后窗口期，如果这段时间都毫无起色，那中共埋的雷，处理不好会拖累死1980-2040年代出生的人。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2033.2</strong> —–2023-04-02 20:42:11+08:00:</p>

<p>产业升级需要解绑知识分子在社会里的权力，放款中小企，有健全的法治和金融机制用于解决商贸和融资问题。</p>

<p>无法做到社会毫无基础就能暴力升级，产业升级意味着企业权力被解放，政府需要在各个环境而都解绑审核权。</p>

<p>举个例子文化服务产业的升级，如果政府一直控制游戏产业的审核，该市场是没有发展的机会，那么该领域就注定不能达到稳定市场，这个道理推广到所有产业都一样，没有任何可以预知的逻辑规则，政策决定一切。</p>

<p>而可见的未来，看不出政府有愿意放权解绑，来换取产业进一步升级的可能。</p>

<p>他们希望一方面控制产业为自己所用享受产业升级带来的经济好处，另一方面却又要限制产业升级稀释他们权力的可能性，两者是完全矛盾的，而矛盾的根本原因在于官方的政权结构太落后，无法适应现代化社会。</p>

<p>未来5-7，东南亚会继续高速发展，而我们会持续老龄化，基层廉价劳动力开始依赖00后出生的人群，到时三十岁或以下劳动力大概在2-3亿，其中相当一部分要用于维持国内生产，也就是说即便用于出口产业的劳动力总量和价格不变。</p>

<p>都要面临来自印度、东南亚同规模的竞争，因为五到七年，足够一些厂房基建转移过去。</p>

<p>过去常说，世界投资不会去这些地方是因为中国基建好有配套，但是谁一开始都没有基建，他们只是需要时间而已。</p>

<p>中国内部消费始终无法建立起来，不能冲淡这部分成本。</p>

<p>常规模式是，一个国家从廉价劳动力为主的出口经济，逐渐发展科技，产业慢慢升级后，人均产值增加，同时形成内需消费社会，这样就不再依赖外部出口，形成了一个稳定的，内部对内部的投资消费，然后全球化下，本土公司外移厂房，转嫁生产成本给其他发展中地区。</p>

<p>日本和四小龙发展后，转嫁给了中国，按道理中国发展后，应该转嫁给印度和东南亚。</p>

<p>可以想以下，日本和四小龙，都是在全球产业链里，特定产业占据了相当的优势，实现了人均产值和内需消费后，才能稳定下来。</p>

<p>要是他们仍然靠廉价劳动力做出口，中国发展起来了，可以把他们的市场全挤兑死。</p>

<p>那为什么现在挤兑不到呢？就是因为错位市场。</p>

<p>不同国家都出口的东西，他们做的东西更好（包装、品控、品种、宣传），附加产值更高，除此之外还有只有少数市场能生产出口的，比如芯片、各类高尖端的科技、工业产品。</p>

<p>如果你产业升级不到位，卖的东西质量跟发展中国家差不多，注定要跟同价位进行竞争。</p>

<p>到时候就不是中国十四亿人发展出一个全新的发达市场，而是落下去跟印度、非洲、东南亚几十亿人比谁的劳动力更贱更不值钱。</p>

<p>因为没有稳定的内需消费到溢出，所以国内的人口因为各种原因（房价、收入低）没办法买下国内生产的产品。</p>

<p>一旦外部廉价产品进入，国内生产就要跟国外产品竞争，要是通过海关贸易方式进行内部保护，国内就要承担高价和产品数量少的坏处，等于生活质量下降。</p>

<p>内需社会不是一天建成的，五到七年对应的是窗口期，你这个时候就算开始做，可能也要十年甚至更多时间才能完成一个雏形。</p>

<p>要是这五到七年都不去做，到2035年才开始，那起码要2040年代结束才能完成。</p>

<p>相当于给东盟大量人口相对较少的国家，有十几年乃至二十年时间快速跟上发展，而你还在原地踏步，其他发达国家可能十五年没有任何迟疑就完成的事，我们要花一倍甚至三倍的时间去完成。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2036.1</strong> —–2023-04-02 06:14:16+08:00:</p>

<p>华国锋显然后期没预估到党内老国务院派的力量，他自己主政的根基是国务院，后面拿了主席身份其实根本坐不稳。</p>

<p>坐主席的身份，等于必须继承毛泽东在党内的法理，这样一下就把自己变成文革继承人，始终不能有效跟党内干部和解，而邓被华国锋找出来复工后，能崛起翻盘的很大一个原因，就是华国锋无法控制全局，胡耀邦有能力钻空子搞真理标准大讨论。</p>

<p>这样一下就把舆论和群众干部利益跟华国锋对立起来，华国锋自己也找不到台阶下。</p>

<p>胡乱继承政治身份，是华国锋非常错误的一招，但党内你没有主席身份管不了党务，还是要完蛋的。</p>

<p>所以华国锋有两个选择，第一不拿掉四人帮，第二扶持国务院里的老左派上位。</p>

<p>他拿掉四人帮，意味着要么废除毛泽东的政治遗产，要么继承下来，但是他废除了毛泽东嫡系，又不愿意跳出文革和毛泽东的政治叙事，这就大错特错了。</p>

<p>江青当时主要想对付的是邓小平，毛泽东如果没死，邓估计就要被一波送走殉葬了。</p>

<p>毛的安排其实就是党务和行政上用不那么强势的华国锋，继承自己威望遗产的四人帮在文革遗产上，双方一起合作，扶持毛远新逐渐做大。</p>

<p>但结果是嫡系内斗，华国锋放弃了文革遗产，干掉了对文革有很大影响的四人帮，但没放弃毛的遗产，这就叫血脉不纯。</p>

<p>用江青毛远新作为威望合法性的来源，党务和行政上抱团一下，尤其是江青这几个人，非常能折腾，胡耀邦和邓操作的空间就很少。</p>

<p>但四人帮和毛远新始终不能脱离华国锋和汪东兴、叶剑英等人的干部体系，所以双方是内外朝式被粘合在一起的。</p>

<p>因此华国锋最好的方案，要么是不废除四人帮，然后利用四人帮跟邓陈联盟做斗争。要么就是拿掉四人帮后，利用陈云与邓的矛盾，拉拢李先念、陈云等老左派，放弃毛的政治遗产，那样邓上位阻力就很大了。</p>

<p>真实历史的操作是，两个你死我活的群体里，华国锋本身是相对中间位置，但他拿掉了四人帮，导致自己变成众矢之的。</p>

<p>放弃了毛泽东的遗产，还有跟老国务院的左派干部们联合的可能，但是他选择完全继承，找邓复出，希望跟老左派平衡一下，结果反而是邓借打毛泽东政治遗产的机会崛起，然后陈云李先念那面反应却没那么激烈。</p>

<p>因为邓陈都是反感毛泽东政治遗产的，华国锋在消除四人帮后拉一派打一派的做法就不成立，结果都转过头来打他。</p>

<p>搞平反，邓胡路线比他更适合，搞左派计划经济，老国务院的比他更靠谱，所以华国锋打掉四人帮，又不愿意放弃毛的政治遗产，就里外不是人。</p>

<p>当时党内在毛死后的趋势，其实就是彻底倒向反对毛泽东政策，这是必然的，华国锋反对的不彻底，还想继承，然后又裁掉了四人帮这样在毛路线下最受益不可能放弃的人，再用一个不上不下的身份以毛泽东继承者的政治面貌去对接邓陈，直接让他们PTSD抱团。</p>

<p>实际上华国锋不至于完全不能放弃毛路线，华国锋不是造反派，也不是空降的，当初胡耀邦不赞同动华国锋，就是因为华国锋也是建国前的干部，一步步升上来被毛选中的新国务院官僚，比起四人帮，更接近陈云、李先念，但他自己选错了路子，想当第二个毛，结果党内老人一反弹他就下来了，说明他还是高估了自己的能量。</p>

<p>美国可能要花时间，给乌克兰培训和建立能使用美军设备和作战思路的队伍，而不仅仅是把设备扔给乌克兰人让他们随便用，想要建立一个完全由美国战术思维、设备与经验拼装起来的乌克兰队伍。</p>

<p>因为美国近年军改，一直在细分作战单位，增加多功能用途，乌克兰战争基本上明确了未来大规模作战，非常依赖单兵素质和班到连级的综合能力。</p>

<p>美国可能交付的不止是铁疙瘩，而是一整套军事体系，尤其是教学。他们可能希望通过乌克兰战争，以及俄罗斯这样的对手，测试他们近年的军事理念是否可行，作为与中国交火的一个模拟。</p>

<p>否则美国找不到任何地方可以做这种高效率的实战测试，尤其是台海战争愈发有可能爆发的背景下。</p>

<p>I have never heard of “mandatory” tutoring, as an additional instructional component, nor have I ever seen a college math professor give participation points for such a component (particularly, where doing so would change the course requirements mid-way through the semester).  If that grading criteria was added after the course began, it likely does not comply with intradepartmental (or university) policy.  However, if that criteria was a part of the original syllabus, OP needs to have a discussion with the professor.</p>

<p>If OP is doing well without the tutoring, it is insane to penalize him/her by requiring mere participation in a separate instructional component.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This next bit is going to sound harsh, but I’m speaking from the viewpoint of the professor and department.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am also speaking from the viewpoint of a professor.  And my response to you will seem a bit harsh, because you seem to have missed the point of what a math class is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Further, from the viewpoint of a professor who routinely butted heads with incompetent departmental and university admins, in my experience, the folks on the admin side tend to be the ones who are too incompetent to conduct a proper class.  Almost without exception, they lack anything approximating instructional ability, and more or less function as the “HR” of universities.  The folks who fill these roles rarely publish.  Doing so is often beyond the limits of their ability.  If they publish, they can only pass muster in journals no one has ever heard of.  Their h-indexes are lower than some of the post docs I’ve worked with. And they have not even submitted a grant proposal in years, or if they have, they never got funded.  Is this your situation?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I may not agree with the professor’s policy, my issue is that it seems pretty late in the semester to address this policy. If all expectations were given to you upfront and you stayed in the course without asking your professor for potential accommodations, etc., the you implicitly agreed to the policy. Then, you failed to comply, and now you’re complaining because you didn’t do the work. I’m not saying that is what happened. But that’s what it’s going to look like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am getting the sense that you do not actually teach.  Let’s unpack this situation together.</p>

<p>First, OP is in an “online only” math class.  Which is terrible.  The post-COVID incoming classes seem to be further behind than any prior, because everyone dropped the ball during the pandemic.  I remember when this bullshit began.  Pearson and McGraw Hill started aggressively marketing their “online components” as course supplements to a standardized curriculum for lower-level classes.  University department heads, who did not understand (and did not bother to understand) how those classes were taught thought this would be a great idea.  But they incorrectly assumed those platforms would work as advertised.  They never did.</p>

<p>Second, you assume OP knew the tutoring was mandatory, or should have known the tutoring was mandatory, as of the date the class began.  Did you read the OP?  OP has a 4.0 GPA outside of <strong>this</strong> class, in particular.  Students with 4.0 GPAs tend to be able to perform, whether they have a good professor or not.  But you assumed the professor communicated the course grading criteria clearly from the start.  It seems to me like if the grading criteria <em>were</em> communicated clearly from the start (read: written in the initial syllabus), OP wouldn’t be in this situation.</p>

<p>Third, although OP wasn’t clear on this point, it seems to me like the professor changed the grading criteria mid-way through the semester.  A component that was not there before has now been added.  If the professor changed the grading criteria in the middle of the semester, that’s an issue.  It may also be an issue from a departmental perspective.  As someone who holds himself out to be “speaking from the viewpoint of the . . . department,” I am surprised you didn’t note this issue.  All you said was that the student shouldn’t go to the chair without talking to the professor first.  And your only suggestion was to have the student try to make up the tutoring, which you assumed was a part of the grading criteria from day one of the class.</p>

<p>Fourth, if the professor changed the grading criteria mid-way through the semester, it seems like that’s something we would need to understand.  If a lot of students are failing to perform adequately, granting “participation” points may be a way to boost their grades.  Credit for participation in a math class seems fairly idiotic to me, but I assume you never taught math classes (or anything similar).  However idiotic the new grading scheme may be for this sort of class, there’s got to be a way to do it without tanking OP’s grade while still being fair to the rest of the class.  Further note that making tutoring “mandatory” could impact the credit-hour designation with the registrar, so it is not obvious to me the professor even had the right to add an additional instructional component such as mandatory tutoring.</p>

<p>Fifth, I suggest you take a step back and think about what the point of a math class is, in the first place.  The point is to equip students with a skillset that is useful in the world, outside of school.  The point is not to account for time spent doing a particular activity, such as ostensibly “mandatory” tutoring.  If OP was performing well without the bullshit participation component, based on the prior objective grading criteria (e.g., tests, quizzes, homework, etc.), it is nonsensical to add such a component that would drop his/her grade.  Your “advice” seems to have missed that most basic aspect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless, I don’t think OP intentionally tried to ignore work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Students with 4.0 GPAs tend to aim to meet expectations, no matter how stupid those expectations are.</p>

<p>Mandatory tutoring for a college math class is a stupid expectation.  It is not normal at all.</p>

<p>But it seems reasonable to infer that if that expectation was a part of the course requirements that the professor clearly communicated from the start (read: written out in the syllabus), OP wouldn’t be in this situation.</p>

<p>That is why the comment from “Charming-Barnacle-15” seems pretty vapid to me.</p>

<p>—– <strong>515.3</strong> —–2023-03-29 21:48:59+08:00:</p>

<p>Yes, it is. And the whole approach of “assume the student fucked up,” when OP says he/she has a 4.0 GPA otherwise is insane.</p>

<p>OP seems to have been blindsided by expectations that were changed mid-way through the semester.  Which is understandable.</p>

<p>—– <strong>515.4</strong> —–2023-03-30 11:29:13+08:00:</p>

<p>If tutoring is mandatory where you teach, you are in no position to weigh in on pedagogy.  That would be like asking Nikocado Avocado for dietary advice.</p>

<p>Determining whether the syllabus, in electronic form, was changed, is not complicated.  But the student may not be able to do it.  The department chair easily could. Assuming the syllabus is electronic, the metadata and version history would say whether it had been recently changed.  An audit log on the back-end should be easily obtainable. But it almost certainly doesn’t even need to get that far.  The department chair should ask the instructor whether the grading requirements were changed.  And if so, why.  It is possible the instructor had a good reason.</p>

<p>Tangentially, it is my view that tutoring requirements which form a participation component of a student’s final grade in a math class are nonsensical.</p>

<p>The ASVAB is something like an IQ test.  The idea is to determine whether you’re smart enough to be useful in the military.  As you probably know from recruiting, it’s a low bar.</p>

<p>If you scored in the 75th percentile or higher on the ASAB, you should assume  you have the capability to outperform most college students in most college settings.  Obviously, some colleges are more competitive than others (e.g., Columbia would be more competitive than Pace University).  And some majors are going to be more competitive than others (e.g., majoring in engineering is harder than majoring in history).</p>

<p>Even still, intelligence and education are not the same thing.  There are plenty of stupid civilian kids that get college degrees.  There are plenty of smart Marines who enlist right out of high school and don’t go to college.  Some of them don’t have any other options.  Some of them don’t want to go to college.  And some of them want to get out in the world and actually do something that matters, as opposed to sitting in a classroom for four more years listening to some self-styled intellectual drone on about gender theory.</p>

<p>I almost enlisted right out of high school.  The marine recruiter saw my SAT scores, ASVAB scores and was doing everything he could to keep me from talking to the Air Force recruiter.  This was shortly after 9/11, although my reasons for wanting to enlist were personal.  Sometimes I wonder what direction my life would have taken, if I’d enlisted.</p>

<p>I wound up going to college on a full ride, got a couple of graduate degrees, and taught college kids for a little while.  I refused to put up with bullshit of higher academia.  Now I work in biotech.</p>

<p>DM me if there is ever anything I can do to help you.  If you’re trying to figure out what to do after the Marines, I might be able to help with that too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First amendment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States Government found a way around that little problem.  Their solution was simple:  don’t censor people directly, with laws that can be scrutinized.  Or agencies that can be subject to FOIA requests.</p>

<p>Just pay private companies to violate the first amendment on the government’s behalf.  Like Twitter, before Elon Musk bought it.</p>

<p>—– <strong>518.2</strong> —–2023-04-01 22:25:00+08:00:</p>

<p>The government can and has done that.  Many suspect that government contracts of this type were the only reason Twitter appeared profitable, before Musk bought it.</p>

<p>Twitter set up a portal for federal employees to flag content that would be removed from the platform.  Twitter also throttled the visibility of entire categories of discussion, the activity of specific people (including journalists) and groups.</p>

<p>The workflow was more complicated than this, but basically here is how it worked:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Employee of the federal government finds content they don’t like, people who post content the employee didn’t like, conceptual categories, and the like.</li>
  <li>Employee of the federal government identifies that content, user or group, or conceptual category to Twitter’s so-called “Trust &amp; Safety” team.</li>
  <li>Twitter’s so-called “Trust &amp; Safety” team removes the information, throttles its visibility, throttles user visibility, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>This bullshit was initially described as necessary to control “misinformation.”  But that was not what Twitter was doing.  Twitter was engaged in overt censorship of political dissent, among other egregious constitutional violations at the behest of the federal government.  Some folks at some media outlets knew this was going on and knowingly decided to withhold it from the public.</p>

<p>But then Elon Musk bought Twitter and this information was made public.  Astonishingly, the media (except folks like Matt Taibbi) tried to spin this as a good thing.  More astonishingly, some citizens were ok with the censorship.</p>

<p>Relatedly, the discussion of these issues has been very nonsensical.  For example, some argued Twitter had a right to decide how to operate the platform, because Twitter is a private company.</p>

<p>Those people did not understand that Twitter was censoring content at the behest of the government.  Obviously, the government’s use of a company as its cat’s paw to violate the first amendment is just as wrong as doing the same thing, directly.</p>

<p>Disgraceful.</p>

<p>—– <strong>518.3</strong> —–2023-04-01 22:37:42+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Legally can they do that? I mean 1st amendment and all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Constitutional rights mean nothing if they are not enforced.  Who will enforce them?  The government, of course.  Except when doing so does not suit the government.</p>

<p>People should have read what Snowden disclosed.  And made some effort to understand it. Do you seriously think that agencies of the government give a shit about the constitution?  The government will impede on liberty to the extent it can get away with doing so.  That is the norm.  Need proof?  Remember when James Clapper lied under oath about what information the NSA was collecting under the Patriot Act?  There was no accountability.</p>

<p>And there has been no accountability for Twitter, so far, or the individuals (many of whom Elon Musk fired shortly after joining) who participated in or developed the scheme I described above.</p>]]></content><author><name>theoryofdoom</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ForeignAffairsMag在2023-03-27~2023-04-02的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-30/ForeignAffairsMag/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ForeignAffairsMag在2023-03-27~2023-04-02的言论" /><published>2023-03-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-30/ForeignAffairsMag</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-30/ForeignAffairsMag/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Biden’s first Summit for Democracy, held virtually in December 2021, sought to galvanize democratic countries to work toward advancing democracy within their own borders. But the United States didn’t build an accompanying monitoring mechanism, making it difficult to track countries’ progress on the commitments they made. Nor has the United States made defending democracy abroad a major foreign policy priority, a puzzling decision given that Biden has described the struggle between democracy and autocracy as “the defining challenge of our time.”<br />
As a candidate for president, Biden campaigned on the need to preserve democracy at home and abroad. Since taking office, he has championed voting rights and worked to strengthen democratic institutions within the United States. But his administration’s approach to defending democracy beyond U.S. borders has been much less vigorous. It has centered around organizing summits that bring together countries that are already largely committed to democracy, bolstering democratic reformers, and responding to broad, thematic challenges to democracy, such as the use of technology to limit individual freedoms. None of this requires making hard choices between values and interests when dealing with autocracies or backsliding democracies or confronting individual autocratic leaders.</p>

<p>Effectively pushing back against election falsehoods can seem like an impossible task, but Americans have learned a lot in recent years, and there are communications strategies and legislative measures that can help blunt the effects of disinformation. The first is to continuously “pre-bunk” disinformation and direct citizens to trusted sources, before false information has been spread and believed. Analyses of online election-related conversations by the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Brennan Center, and others have found that high-profile election deniers rely on the same core false narratives over and over. This repetition means that it is possible to predict a good deal of election disinformation. Therefore, election officials, public leaders, and civic organizations can anticipate false points likely to be raised, train voters to recognize false information, provide factual evidence to rebut—or “pre-bunk”—recurring rumors, and direct voters to trusted sources.</p>

<p>It is too early to say for certain what these developments mean. Conflict is not certain or imminent. But something has changed in Beijing that policymakers and business leaders worldwide cannot afford to ignore. If Xi says he is readying for war, it would be foolish not to take him at his word.<br />
The first sign that this year’s meetings of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference—known as the “two-sessions” because both bodies meet simultaneously—might not be business as usual came on March 1, when the top theoretical journal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) published an essay titled “Under the Guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Army, We Will Advance Victoriously.” The essay appeared under the name “Jun Zheng”—a homonym for “military government” that possibly refers to China’s top military body, the Central Military Commission—and argued that “the modernization of national defense and the military must be accelerated.” It also called for an intensification of Military-Civil Fusion, Xi’s policy requiring private companies and civilian institutions to serve China’s military modernization effort.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2023-03-20~2023-03-26的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-26/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2023-03-20~2023-03-26的言论" /><published>2023-03-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-26/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-26/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1149.1</strong> —–2023-03-21 09:08:49+08:00:</p>

<p>I’d like to elaborate on the linked posts (thanks /u/huianxin) and on /u/ParallelPain’s by pointing out that Yoshinobu’s situation when he surrendered in May 1868 was considerably less than ideal.</p>

<p>Firstly, Toba-Fushimi. Bakufu casualties were actually quite high, because although 15000 or so men were assembled at Osaka, Yoshinobu had been – not incorrectly – paranoid about local lords declaring for SatChō, and had thus detached considerable forces to garrison key areas, and as a result the combined forces at Toba, Fushimi, and Yodo on 27 January were perhaps 6000 men at a stretch. The 900 or so men killed or wounded would have constituted around 15% of the force, which in a premodern context would be considered par for the course for a defeated army. The casualty rate was much lower than most major American Civil War battles of course – for instance, the Confederates lost a third of their troops at Gettysburg, the Union a quarter – but still, a lost battle is a demoralising affair that troops can have difficulty recovering from, particularly if they are vigorously pursued. Moreover, the detached forces simply don’t seem to have been able to serve as a meaningful reserve in the wake of the collapse of the vanguard. So the army was defeated, split into two – one part going to Osaka and the other retreating to Edo – and there was very little ability to actually halt the continued SatChō advance. If the overall Bakufu war effort had been a little reluctant to begin with, then the defeat probably sapped much of whatever enthusiasm there had been.</p>

<p>We also ought to consider that Bakufu losses included not only killed and wounded on the battlefield, but critically, defections to the SatChō army among its central Japanese allies. The overall Bakufu expeditionary force at Osaka included at least 3700 men from its various allies. 1600 were from Aizu, but the remainder were predominantly from central Japan: 1000 from Tsu, 400 from Kuwana, and 1100 from Obama, Kameyama, and Himeji combined, along with uncertain numbers of others such as Matsuyama, Ōgaki, and Miyazu. But Tsu defected during the battle, Ōgaki and Miyazu shortly afterward, and Matsuyama withdrew from the war outright. Aizu and Kuwana were basically the only significant domains to contribute troops to the Bakufu force at Toba-Fushimi and still remain loyal afterward. Otherwise, the SatChō victory had essentially flipped the entirety of central Japan from broadly pro-Tokugawa to broadly pro-SatChō. The situation in northern Japan likewise did not favour the Tokugawa position. Only Aizu and to an extent Shōnai had supported the Bakufu at the start of the war, while the north had broadly declared neutrality. By April, many of the northern domains may have appeared to be aligned with the SatChō-controlled court, and on 3 May – about three weeks after Yoshinobu’s surrender on 11 April – Sendai actually formally sided with the court to attack Aizu. So the Tokugawa clan was further hamstrung by its diplomatic isolation: the other lords of Japan simply were not, by and large, willing to commit themselves to the defence of their old hegemon.</p>

<p>It’s worth restating ParallelPain’s point here that a consistent priority for most of the belligerents seems to have been to ensure that the overall political and territorial integrity of Japan remained intact, because it is worth noting that Yoshinobu did have a nuclear option that would have theoretically allowed him to continue fighting while also denying any claim to be an enemy of the court. This was Prince Kōgen, the abbot of Kan’ei-ji in Ueno (styled Rinnōji-no-miya) and grandson by adoption of Emperor Kōkaku (Meiji’s great-grandfather). It had been Tokugawa policy to ensure that the position of abbot of the Kan’ei-ji temple complex, just outside Edo, was held by a collateral prince of the imperial house, just in case it was deemed necessary to hoist their own rival emperor onto the throne. That Yoshinobu chose not to do this says a lot about his will and/or perceived ability to continue the fight. That the Northern Alliance, formed by Sendai after it fell out with SatChō within weeks of attacking Aizu, <em>did</em> install Kōgen as the Emperor Tōbu in August, says a lot about <em>their</em> investment in the fight.</p>

<p>Because, to pivot to that topic, we could honestly say it’s surprising the Boshin War lasted as <em>long</em> as it did. The northern domains seem to have rapidly cottoned on to the fact that imperial restoration was actually just a cover for establishing a Satsuma and Chōshū hegemony, and, under Sendai leadership, banded together in an alliance over the course of late May and June. The calculus of attrition probably favoured SatChō anyway, but the vicissitudes of fortune played a part in shaping the conflict to come. Perhaps most critically, Akita Domain rather dramatically switched sides on 21 August and split the Northern Alliance’s war effort onto two fronts, which limited Shōnai’s ability to reinforce the much-pressed defence of Aizu. But there were also other factors: Tokugawa loyalists by and large cohered around Vice-Admiral Enomoto Takeaki and his rather romantic ambitions of establishing an autonomous fiefdom on Hokkaido, rather than supporting the northerners who had chosen not to support the Bakufu at the start of the year. On the flip side, you had the secondary front in Nagaoka Domain, where a SatChō force under Yamagata Aritomo tried to advance eastward along the coast and take the key northern port city of Niigata, which was deemed a key lynchpin in the supply of arms to Aizu. Despite an apparent superiority in numbers that allowed the SatChō force to quickly seize Nagaoka Castle, Yamagata completely bungled his next moves, spread his forces too wide, and ended up losing the castle again to an Alliance counterattack; Niigata ended up being taken <em>after</em> the fall of Aizu by an army advancing westward from the mountains. But either way, the forces of fortune didn’t really decisively swing things either way, and the Northern Alliance collapsed under pressure from SatChō forces over the course of October and November.</p>

<p>As ever, the winter was not good campaigning season, hence there being no real attempt to land at Hokkaido in force until the following spring. But in many ways, the war <em>could</em> have ended in April 1868. Indeed, we could probably surmise that, for Tokugawa Yoshinobu, it <em>should</em> have done. But the persistence of some Tokugawa loyalists like Enomoto Takeaki or the <em>shōgitai</em> guerrillas, plus the rather tactless behaviour of SatChō envoys to the northern domains, helped keep the war going for months past the resolution of the original crisis over the continued status of the Tokugawa clan and its holdings.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure that’s the case, albeit going purely off what numbers I can glean from Totman, where adding together absolutely everything I can’t see more than about 7000 men involved – and that’s assuming relatively generous numbers for the uncountables. While the Bakufu theoretically had some 7000 regular troops (6000 in 12 regular battalions, plus the two battalions of Denshūtai/sappei), from what I can gather, only four to six of the battalions, plus the Denshūtai, were actually involved in the fighting.</p>

<p>EDIT: I probably ought to clarify that what I mean here are the numbers <em>at the battle itself</em>, rather than the total size of the expeditionary force.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1149.3</strong> —–2023-03-21 15:18:10+08:00:</p>

<p>Thanks! This certainly complicates the numbers I’d got from Totman, and would suggest potentially a much larger force <em>overall</em> (as in, originally assembled at Ōsaka) than the 15k he suggested, assuming that what Noguchi means by a ‘regiment’ is equivalent to what Totman means by a ‘battalion’, and that the six regiments/battalions engaged represented only half of the twelve total in the army writ large.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1153.1</strong> —–2023-03-24 04:35:31+08:00:</p>

<p>I think what you’ve suggested aligns mostly with what I think. Kevin’s accounts weren’t posting premium answers, so the only way to earn money was being partnered for revenue from questions, and from what I can tell, only a portion of the questions Kevin and his accounts responded to were posted by his sockpuppets. At least a few were from real users. Maybe this was a plausible deniability scheme, but either way, Kevin’s approach was distinctly non-profit-maximising.</p>

<p>I think the interesting question is why he claimed all the various titles and accolades that he did on his main account: his PhD from the University of Austin being the big one. This is the sort of thing that is theoretically easy to check, but at the same time, if for whatever reason you don’t want to believe someone is lying – because to be honest <em>why would anyone do this</em> – you wouldn’t find it too difficult to work out some alternative rationale. In essence, Kevin was lying about his trustworthiness in order to build a self-sustaining circle of lies. Fascinatingly, he largely did this without producing a single sentence of original writing.</p>

<p>But part of me also wonders if it was some kind of curious social experiment. I don’t know if you also caught the <a href="https://twitter.com/EMicrostate/status/1491763068182745088">sequel thread</a>, but if not I highly recommend you do: Kevin had maintained <em>at least</em> 20 sockpuppet accounts, and had already survived a partial purge of these a couple of years before I dug up the ring again. By having this ecosystem of sockpuppets, he was able to build up a sort of barrier of plausible deniability, where unless you were aware of the plagiarism, then it seemed utterly implausible that <em>all</em> 15-ish of the active accounts engaging with each other were fake. He also brazenly re-used an already-banned account (Josue Dennis Chance) with the same profile picture and bio, and I cannot imagine that was done for any reason other than to stick the finger up at Quora’s nonexistent moderation. A lot of this feels like it was trying to see what he could get away with if nobody stopped him.</p>

<p>But at the same time, Kevin was still taking care to ensure the ruse made sense. The sudden asking of follow-ups to old answers suggests that Kevin was, if nothing else, aware that a failure to answer follow-ups on Quora, especially genuinely new ones, would be seriously detrimental to his image. This meant, on occasion, doing the ‘trickster plays against two chess grandmasters simultaneously’ gambit as I describe in the linked thread, wherein Kevin copy-pasted follow-ups from Quora onto AskHistorians, and then crossposted the AH replies back over to Quora. Which is a real gamble in general because you’re presuming that the original answerer will be willing to reply to the follow-up, but it’s especially risky with older answers where the users might have left the sub, or be too engaged in other pursuits to substantively engage. As noted in that thread, there was a tendency for Kevin to randomly reply in threads asking about older answers on a <em>similar</em> topic by a given user, which is pretty unusual, especially if the user in question doesn’t maintain an archive of links in their profile – which I do, to be fair.</p>

<p>But the weirdest part to me is that Kevin specifically reposted ELI5 comments as well as AskHistorians, and I’m genuinely curious what the rationale there was. Was he trying to diversify his content to avoid suspicion? This would be odd because a diverse range of expertises is <em>more</em> suspicious, not less. I really can’t think of any good reason to do that, other than, perhaps, because he wanted to prove that he could.</p>

<p>So as it stands I think there are a few possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Kevin was desperate for attention and found what he thought was an easy way to get it;</li>
  <li>Kevin was somewhat delusional and believed that this AskHistorians crossposting was doing Quora a service (which in a sense I suppose it was);</li>
  <li>Kevin was mainly doing it to prove that he could, and that nobody would stop him.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the most unfortunate element of all this is that Quora’s UI is not very friendly to archive searching, so now that Quora has actually taken action and purged things, we ordinary users performing Quora OSINT can’t really go back and dig up more on Kevin Richardson. So this is all we have to go on.</p>

<p>As an edited-in coda, I have to admit I get vague twinges of Tommy Tallarico from this, or at least hbomberbuy’s famous takedown recently. But that’s a more modern issue and not entirely analogous.</p>

<p>Again, no – several states, for separate reasons at separate times, built walls, sometimes but not always on the sites of prior walls. But that is not the same as a singular, continuous construction project, <em>especially</em> during long periods of nomadic rule in China when there was no reason to build walls between two parts of your own empire.</p>

<p>No. The term <em>changcheng</em> (‘long walls’) appears in a variety of contexts well into the Ming period that imply that the phrase was not understood as a proper noun specifically denoting a specific set of frontier defences, but rather as a term for any set of contiguous fortifications. The principal Ming phraseology was the ‘nine Garrisons’ (<em>jiuzhen</em>), which encompassed all of the military assets, mobile and static, that covered their steppe border.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1159.6</strong> —–2023-03-27 06:27:04+08:00:</p>

<p>I don’t know why you decided just to assert the exact opposite of what my linked answers say without attempting to cite any sources, because no, <em>that is untrue</em>. We can be reasonably sure the Qin walls were maintained into the Han, but after that no new walls would be built until the Sui and those that did exist seem to have fallen into disrepair; the Sui walls again don’t seem to have been maintained for very long either. The Ming walls were built from scratch, and often do not follow the course of the Qin or Sui walls at all. If you can provide <em>any</em> kind of evidence that there was a northern frontier wall that was meaningfully still in existence between the 11th and 15th centuries, then you’d better do so.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1159.7</strong> —–2023-03-30 21:23:04+08:00:</p>

<p>What I’m referring to here is the idea of the walls constantly being built in roughly the same place. What Northern Qi, Khitan Liao, and Jurchen Jin did was build walls on the edges of <em>their</em> empires, which were at considerable geographical remove from the prior walls built by Han Chinese states.</p>

<p>Kira/Odo is I think more polarising than that. Kira/Odo went ahead without really a full reckoning with all the heinous shit Odo got up to, and there’s also a decent slice of the fanbase who – I think quite fairly – read early-season Kira as very queer and who basically read Odo as the latest in a series of male flings for Kira that just didn’t really land (i.e. Bareil, Shakaar).</p>

<p>—– <strong>1160.2</strong> —–2023-03-27 08:56:04+08:00:</p>

<p>On the previous thread I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/11vnlzo/hobby_scuffles_week_of_march_20_2023/jdq5zib/">wrote a little bit</a> about ‘The Dutch in the Medway’, a poem from 1911 about an event in 1667 set to music from the 1680s by a musician in 1982, which military music enthusiasts on Youtube have tried to pass off as being an ‘English Folk Song’ or an ‘Anglo-Dutch War Song’, neither of which is entirely true, but neither of which is entirely false either. But today I want to talk about a different song, one which I have listened to on and off for the past 6 years if not longer: ‘Bang Upon the Big Drum’. This will be a little stream-of-consciousness-y, as I wrote this partly while actually following the leads, so it may be a case of the text being used to organise my thoughts rather than my thoughts being used to organise the text, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The only recording of ‘Bang Upon the Big Drum’ by a professional group is on the 1971 album <em>Songs and Music of the Redcoats</em>, essentially a tie-in with Lewis Winstock’s book of the same name, published the year before. Winstock sang in the chorus on part of the album, which was primarily recorded by Martyn Wyndham-Reed, a rather obscure trio called The Druids, and members of the Band of the Scots Guards. It’s a very interesting album with selections ranging from the First English Civil War (1642-6) to the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), some with lyrics and some purely instrumental, including a rather nice rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeAtpoZbyEE&amp;t=895s">The Grenadier’s Return</a>, and in the section simply labelled ‘Indian Wars’, it has this particular gem: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnzaR1158UA">‘Bang Upon the Big Drum’</a>. Now, based on what people have reproduced of the album lining, Winstock had this to say about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Written at Kabul during the Second Afghan War, this seems to have been popular, as Kipling mentions it several times in his soldier stories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Second Anglo-Afghan War, fought between 1878 and 1880, loomed large in the Anglo-Indian historical memory, with serious political failures despite ostensible military successes. And these military successes were not total either. The Battle of Maiwand on 27 July 1880 saw nearly 1000 British and Indian troops killed out of a force of 2500, in what was more or less the only battlefield defeat suffered by the Anglo-Indian army; the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment, one of the principal participants, would continue to mark ‘Maiwand Day’, even after its absorption into the Duke of Edinburgh’s Royal Regiment, until that regiment was dissolved in 1994. The war also saw an incident where 46 cavalrymen drowned attempting a night crossing of the Kabul River, an event Kipling marked with the appropriately-titled <a href="https://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poem/poems_ford.htm">‘Ford ‘O Kabul River’</a>.</p>

<p>But to my eye, it’s not necessarily straightforward to claim that Kipling was <em>recording</em> a song. Kipling was born in India in 1865, but for the duration of the war, he was at a boarding school in Devon. It was, to be sure, a school run for the children of military officers (of which Kipling was not), but it doesn’t seem like the sort of vector by which soldiers’ songs would easily reach him. He would not return to India until he started his career as a journalist in 1882, and he then left again for London in 1889, and it is presumably in this period that he would have had the most contact with war veterans. In fact, he went on to have encounters with Second Afghan War veterans in various other places – the poem ‘That Day’, about the rout of the Berkshires at Maiwand, was inspired by an encounter with a veteran while on holiday in Bermuda in 1894.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the one place I hadn’t thought to look until recently was the website of The Kipling Society, which maintains digitised copies of <em>The Kipling Journal</em>, which are made open-access after two years. And this includes the 178th issue of the journal from June 1971, with an article by (drum roll please)……… Lewis Winstock.</p>

<p><em>Bingo</em>.</p>

<p>And what Winstock notes is that there is, in the British Museum, a copy of a song purportedly authored by one Phillip Crampton Neville, an officer in the 14th Lancers during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, titled ‘Bang Upon the Big Drum’. I have so far been unable to track this down and I presume it simply isn’t online, but assuming that Winstock and others reproduced it faithfully for <em>Redcoats</em>, then it appears to be the case that instead of it being pieced together from fragments of Kipling, that Kipling instead pulled fragments out of that. In particular, the following reappear in Kipling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bang upon the big drum, crash upon the cymbals<br />
We’ll sing as we go marching along boys, along<br />
And although on this campaign<br />
There’s no whiskey or champagne<br />
Still, we’ll keep our spirits going with a song, boys!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, the chorus of the song, appears in the short story ‘The Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney’, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bang upon the big drum, bash upon the cymbals,<br />
As we go marchin’ along, boys, oh!<br />
For although<br />
in this campaign<br />
There’s no whisky nor champagne,<br />
We’ll keep our spirits goin’ with a song, boys!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Kipling also appears to have included alternate lyrics for the second half of one of the verses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So they sent a corp’ril’s file,<br />
And they put me in the guard-room<br />
For conduck unbecomin’ of a soldier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the beginning of another short story, ‘The Three Musketeers’, Kipling includes an anonymous ‘Barrack-Room Ballad’:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An’ when the war began, we chased the bold Afghan,<br />
An’ we made the bloomin’ Ghazi for to flee, boys O!<br />
An’ we marched into Kabul, an’ we tuk the Balar ‘Issar,<br />
An’ we taught ‘em to respect the British soldier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As recorded in <em>Redcoats</em>, the same verse goes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then we marched through Chalasan and we met the wild Afghan<br />
And made him at Char Asiab for to run boys, oh!<br />
And we marched into Kabul, and we took the Bala Hisar<br />
And we made them to respect the British soldier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kipling’s version seems like a close enough deviation that might have gone around in the postwar period.</p>

<p>So what makes this interesting is that the reason that I thought ‘Bang Upon the Big Drum’ might be a Kipling composite was listening through Peter Bellamy’s settings of the Barrack-Room Ballads to music, which includes the tune <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZSeaj0RM60">‘The Bay’nit and the Butt’</a>, where the verse from ‘The Three Musketeers’ is used. As it turns out, it was Bellamy taking liberties here, by taking that variant of the verse from ‘Bang Upon the Big Drum’, following it up with a modified version of <a href="https://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poem/poems_volley.htm">the anonymous ‘Barrack-Room Ballad’</a> which opens ‘The Taking of Lungtungpen’.</p>

<p>Which basically means that I was wrong, but in a good way – the song is in fact real. The appearances of bits and pieces of that song in Kipling are not indications that the song was actually pieced together from Kipling, but rather that fragments did make it into his work by authentic means. And so one can now listen to ‘Bang Upon the Big Drum’ with considerably less guilt about its historical authenticity. Unless someone digs up the original score from 1889 and finds cause for complaint.</p>

<p>—– <strong>369.1</strong> —–2023-03-21 21:06:15+08:00:</p>

<p>[SS from the article by Jessica Chen Weiss, Professor for China and Asia-Pacific Studies at Cornell University and a Senior Fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.]<br />
Fears that China will soon invade Taiwan are overblown. There is little evidence that Chinese leaders see a closing window for action. Such fears appear to be driven more by Washington’s assessments of its own military vulnerabilities than by Beijing’s risk-reward calculus. Historically, Chinese leaders have not started wars to divert attention from domestic challenges, and they continue to favor using measures short of conflict to achieve their objectives. If anything, problems at home have moderated Chinese foreign policy, and Chinese popular opinion has tended to reward government bluster and displays of resolve that do not lead to open conflict.</p>

<p>If Western policymakers exaggerate the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, they might inadvertently create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead of worrying that Beijing will gin up a foreign crisis to bolster its standing at home or assuming that Beijing feels pressured to invade in the near term, the United States should focus on arresting—or at least decelerating—the action-reaction spiral that has steadily ratcheted up tensions and made a crisis more likely. That does not mean halting efforts to bolster Taiwan’s resilience to Chinese coercion or to diversify the United States’ defense posture in the region. But it does mean avoiding needless confrontation and identifying reciprocal steps that Washington and Beijing could take to lower the temperature.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-03-20~2023-03-26的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-21/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-03-20~2023-03-26的言论" /><published>2023-03-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-21/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-21/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1143.1</strong> —–2023-03-16 01:12:44+08:00:</p>

<p>In some ways, this question is ultimately one not of historical causality, but of historiography: <em>why</em> have historians made the arguments they have? Because the answer is not immediately straightforward. I would posit that it all stems from citing an assumption as fact.</p>

<p>In 1970, Philip A Kuhn’s <em>Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China: Militarization and Social Structure, 1796-1864</em> was published, which advanced a bold thesis: the transition from ‘traditional’ to ‘modern’ processes in Chinese state and society, and the resultant breakdown of the imperial order, took place not as a result of violent contact with the West after 1839 as commonly asserted, but rather as a result of internal processes that began snowballing from the 1790s onward. Qing mishandling of the White Lotus Rebellion in 1796-1806 led to the formation of local militias, which increasingly consolidated into regional networks. These were further emboldened by Qing failures in the Opium War of 1839-42, and came to be officially co-opted into the Qing war effort on a mass scale during the Taiping War in 1851-64 with the establishment of <em>Yongying</em> forces under the command of such men as Zeng Guofan. This, however, was the only part that Kuhn analysed in depth, as suggested by the title of his book. While he <em>suggested</em> that the continued decentralisation of Qing military power would lead, eventually, to the warlord period, his actual research focussed squarely on the Jiaqing (1796-1820) and Daoguang (1820-1850) reigns of the Qing, and didn’t actually go beyond 1864. But Kuhn’s extrapolation then became taken as historically sound by a generation of scholars who simply failed to question whether the proposed trajectory was actually, well, true.</p>

<p>And one can detect a variety of responses to this in later literature, albeit often implicit. For instance, Edmund S.K. Fung, in <em>The Military Dimension of the Chinese Revolution</em> (1980), explicitly argues that the New Army that precipitated the 1911 Revolution emerged out of military overhauls after 1895 which supplanted the old Taiping-era militia forces, many of which had been downsized or disbanded following the end of the Taiping conflict. Edward J.M. Rhoads, in <em>Manchus and Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1862-1928</em> (2000), does not tackle warlordism as such, but does point out the rather heterogeneous nature of Qing military reforms, which attempted in the post-1895 period to establish multiethnic imperial corps, pivoting to a much more Han-dominated New Army under the New Policies enacted after 1901. What we end up, with, then, is at least one point of disjuncture – 1895 – separating the divested Taiping-era militias from the more centralised structures that the Qing attempted to impose after the defeat to Japan.</p>

<p>But in neither instance is there an assertion that the warlord armies were direct descendants of the New Army either. Edmund Fung notes that the primary influence of the New Army was in altering the relationship between civil bureaucracy and military leadership, allowing the latter to presume, and therefore assume, greater importance than they had done in the pre-1901 era. But the troops constituting the warlord armies were extremely varied. Some forces, particularly the Anhui and Zhili Cliques, drew heavily, even predominantly, on New Army veterans, whereas other forces were entirely composed of new recruits post-Revolution.</p>

<p>The picture becomes further complicated, however, when we consider that these armies never supplanted each other outright – though not for lack of trying. During the Taiping War, the <em>Yongying</em> reorganised militias rubbed shoulders with local militias, Green Standard forces, and Banner soldiers, all of whom continued to exist afterward. The Wuwei Corps established after 1895 was a limited force based at Beijing, and both imperial and regional forces on older models continued to exist. The New Army reforms attempted to do away with these forces and create bifurcated armies consisting of New Army troops as the ‘tip of the spear’ and ‘Patrol and Defence Forces’ as a peacetime gendarmerie and wartime reserve, but this was still incomplete by the beginning of 1911. Hubei would not disband the last of its Green Standard forces, which constituted about a fifth of its 40,000 military personnel at the start of the year, until the end of June; many of Hunan’s Green Standards, who made up nearly half of its 35,500 troops, were still in service at the time of the revolution on 10 October. Moreover, the Banner units remained largely separate, though the Qing did establish two Manchu-only units: the Imperial Guard and the 1st Division.</p>

<p>So even if you did want to draw a clean genealogy, you don’t really get one: the Taiping-era <em>Yongying</em> didn’t uniformly transform into the New Army, which did not uniformly transition into the warlord armies. Moreover, as suggested earlier, these were not armies of comparable nature. It is easy to overlook that the <em>Yongying</em> armies were commanded by civilian officials given temporary extraordinary powers to maintain and command military forces, not by professional career officers as the New Army was. It is true that the heterogeneous army of 1911 ultimately broke apart in no small part thanks to the ability of charismatic individuals to consolidate control over their own portions, but they were originally, at their core, regional armies, maintained at provincial discretion and at provincial expense, along central directives. The rise of charismatic warlords was a bug rather than a feature. By contrast, the <em>Yongying</em> forces were fundamentally built around their charismatic leaders, and their regional character was somewhat more coincidental. Li Hongzhang’s Huai Army, named for Anhui, spent most of its existence headquartered in Zhili because its commander had gone there; Zeng Guofan’s Xiang Army, named for Hunan, ultimately recruited beyond its ostensible core province, even if it never outright shook its provincial reputation. The resemblances between the <em>Yongying</em> and the New Army, then, were largely superficial, and as has been said, the warlord armies were not simple successors of a fragmenting New Army.</p>

<p>With that I think it is safe to say that Taiping-era military decentralisation really <em>didn’t</em> lead to the Warlord Era. We can draw a chronological and causative chain, of course, but it is not one of a linear trajectory. The New Army <em>replaced</em> (well, mostly replaced) the Taiping-era militias in response to their failures, and had substantial organisational differences. The warlords did not receive the New Army wholesale, but drew on what troops they could, where they could. Two substantial points of rupture separate the Taiping from the warlords, both representing significant changes in direction.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1143.2</strong> —–2023-03-17 07:43:34+08:00:</p>

<p>So, to give a brief and general chronology of Qing military organisation:</p>

<p>Before 1644, all (or effectively all) of the armed forces of the Qing were organised through the Eight Banners, which started out as a multiethnic entity comprising Manchus, Mongols, Han Chinese, and various other, smaller groups in Manchuria. After crossing the Great Wall in 1644, however, the Qing chose not to expand the Eight Banners, but instead incorporated defecting Ming troops and new recruits into a new force, the Green Standard Army. The Green Standards were a distinctly second-line force in their conception: at some point post-conquest they were barred from using firearms, until the ban was lifted in the Yongzheng reign (1722-35); they were also mainly tasked with rural policing and personnel support for the civil service, and were largely parcelled out into very small garrisons. Any larger formation of Green Standards had to be established on an ad hoc basis, and rarely could more than a very small portion of them be mobilised out of their home regions. This was, incidentally, by design: the Green Standards were considered politically unreliable, to say the least, as the Qing state as a whole was deeply suspect about the motivations and loyalty of its Han subject population.</p>

<p>The Qing also maintained a local militia system as part of the <em>baojia</em>, a centrally-organised system which regulated both local defence and tax collection. <em>Baojia</em>-organised militias would then often be co-opted into Qing field armies as <em>yong</em> (‘braves’) for additional manpower. However, the <em>baojia</em>’s militia component proved to be insufficiently flexible for rural defence when the White Lotus Rebellion tore through north-central China in the 1790s, and amid a general decentring of central power in the Jiaqing reign, there came to be a proliferation of locally-organised <em>tuanlian</em> militia groups across China proper, which increasingly formed local networks of mutually-supporting village militias. Several such networks would be activated at various points in the Opium War of 1839-42, when the formation of <em>tuanlian</em> to provide <em>yong</em> auxiliaries was actively encouraged by the Daoguang Emperor in response to exaggerated claims of their efficacy against the British.</p>

<p>In turn, <em>tuanlian</em> would be drawn upon during the Taiping War, initially by Zeng Guofan and Hu Linyi, at the behest of the imperial government, in order to establish more permanent units known as <em>yongying</em> (‘brave camps’) that would remain in the field until the Taiping were dealt with. At the war’s conclusion in 1864, Zeng Guofan disbanded his army (Hu Linyi’s army appears to have dissolved and been partially reincorporated into Zeng’s after his own death in 1861); however a number of other, smaller <em>yongying</em> forces existed across China, in areas with and without fighting. Cen Yuying led <em>yongying</em> forces against rebels in Yunnan until their defeat in 1873, and the residual Yunnanese <em>yongying</em> would then go on to fight the French in Vietnam in 1884-5; a splinter branch of the Hunan Army under Zuo Zongtang fought in northwest China and latterly Xinjiang between 1865 and 1878. On the other hand, Li Hongzhang retained his Huai Army in northern China after 1864, but its only significant action after the Taiping conflict was in 1894-5, when they formed the core of the Qing army that fought (and lost to) the Japanese in Korea.</p>

<p>We then have a weird interlude in 1895-1900 with the establishment of the modernised Wuwei Corps, a heterogeneous force of five unequally-sized divisions, three of which were made up of Han, one of Hui (Sinophone Muslims), and one of Manchus. This force only existed in Beijing and doesn’t seem to have intentionally presaged any sort of later organisation, but it had a strong degree of <em>yongying</em> roots: all three commanders of the Han divisions (Nie Shicheng, Song Qing, and Yuan Shikai) had been officers of the now-defunct Huai Army, and indeed Song Qing had originally assembled his own unit during the Taiping War which was then absorbed into Li Hongzhang’s army.</p>

<p>What happened with the New Army reforms was an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complicated state of Qing military organisation by creating three clearly-delineated branches: the Banners would remain as before, while Green Standard and <em>yongying</em> units would be broken up and reorganised into the New Army and the Patrol and Defence Forces. To do this, there was to be a systematic personnel review in each province to divide the troops into three tiers: the best men would fill the quota for the New Army, the next best would go to the Patrol and Defence Forces, and the worst men, now in excess of the quotas, would be discharged altogether. As the answer noted, this process was still very much ongoing in most provinces in 1911, and so most of the New Army and Patrol and Defence Forces had only recently transitioned out of Green Standard and <em>yongying</em> formations. And even then, again as noted, those transitions were still incomplete at the time of the revolution.</p>

<p>So the Black Flag Army is its own kettle of worms, one which I’ve never written a full answer on, but Bradley Camp Davis’ <em>Imperial Bandits</em> is the thing to read for that. As for Cen Yuying, there is scant little on him in English, but he does crop up in the latter chapters of David Atwill’s <em>The Chinese Sultanate</em> on the Yunnanese uprising.</p>

<p>To try to give a concise summary, the Black Flag Army was not a pro-Qing entity in its conception, but it was co-opted to support Qing interests in the latter part of the 1860s. Nor did it have any <em>real</em> Taiping roots: its leader, Liu Yongfu, had originally joined a rebel group called the Yanling Kingdom, led by one Wu Lingyun who <em>claimed</em> to be a Taiping officer, but that was the only actual link. That didn’t stop the French from running with and inflating that genealogy of leadership and asserting that <em>any</em> anti-French Chinese guerrillas in Vietnam were ex-Taipings, but it was never really ‘true’ in that sense.</p>

<p>In many ways the Black Flags, although not originally a <em>yongying</em> force, were actually pretty similar: A force cohering around a charismatic leader, co-opted into the Qing military organisation, and given considerable latitude to raise its own income, particularly off internal customs duties (although in this instance it was given it by the Vietnamese government rather than the Qing). Given the prevalence of defections during the various intra-Qing conflicts from the Taiping onward,* the rapid rehabilitation of the Black Flags is pretty comprehensible. And, like many defecting rebels, it would start out in large part by fighting against former fellow rebels, in this instance the Yellow Flags, a separate splinter of the Kingdom of Yanling which had aligned itself with Tai indigenous groups in northern Vietnam who were then rebelling against Vietnamese rule.</p>

<p>* Take, for example, Miao Peilin, a leader of Nian bandits in north China who betrayed Taiping general Chen Yucheng to the Qing in 1862, then went back to being a rebel and was himself executed in 1863. For an example closer to the Black Flags geographically, in 1863 a Muslim rebel leader named Ma Rulong, who ruled over the eastern part of Yunnan, submitted to Qing authority and began fighting against his erstwhile ally Du Wenxiu in the southwest – again, see <em>The Chinese Sultanate</em>.</p>

<p>Nope. <em>Sakoku</em> was a term retroactively applied by opponents of the Shogunate to decry its apparent short-sightedness. Japan certainly did a lot to economically insulate itself, but it was not without interest in world affairs; hyper-protectionism rather than outright isolationism might be the best way of describing it.</p>

<p>So, the answers to your questions are not wholly straightforward; I would recommend the linked podcast episode and the text post as starting points.</p>

<p>To give a bit of a summary here: As noted in the linked posts, the modern Tartaria conspiracy is a composite of two discursive frames: a textual one based on historical manuscript and print media such as books and maps, which attempts to pinpoint a historical Tartaria in space and time; and a material one based on buildings, which assert a Tartarian origin to various architectural styles. The text-based framing originates with the New Chronology of Russian nationalist pseudohistorian Anatoly Fomenko, while the building-based framing originates with the ‘Cultural Layer’ mudflood conspiracy theory. In a sense, then, the origins of both are relatively old: Fomenko was mainly active in Russia in the early 1990s, culminating in the book <em>Novaia Khronologia</em> in 1995 but his theories were made available to the English-speaking world after the publication of the four-volume <em>History: Fiction or Science?</em> in 2002. Mudfloods/Cultural Layer originally cohered around the forum stolenhistory.org, which appears to have come online by May 2017; the subreddit r CulturalLayer would be set up in September.</p>

<p>These two would combine into the Tartaria conspiracy we all know and love today by late 2018. There’s evidence from early in the year of Russian-speaking members of the CulturalLayer subreddit encountering Fomenko’s Tartaria theory on the Russian web, and in April the founder of StolenHistory, KorbenDallas, posted a thread discussing the Tartaria theory on the forum. This would culminate in the r Tartaria subreddit being founded in December as the primary repository of Tartaria-related posts, at least for the immediate future. Where it has gone since then is somewhat beyond me at this point, as I genuinely haven’t kept a close eye on things in years.</p>

<p>To be honest, while it’s funny, it is also very, very niche, and I can understand how one could miss it quite easily. While there are ostensibly 25,000 subscribers to the Tartaria subreddit, Reddit subscriber numbers are pretty meaningless, and the subreddit is increasingly moribund anyway. There are a few people around who have come across it – and I know some in real life – but it’s not that high up on the internet pseudohistory iceberg, at least not yet.</p>

<p>Might also post this as a non-drama comment, but this weekend saw Hololive’s 4th Fes and Expo happen, which was very fun as last year, helped immensely by the fact that Japan no longer bans cheering at concerts and so for those of us viewing on stream, we finally had some audience reactions. I couldn’t catch most of Day 1’s concert live and haven’t got round to the VOD yet, but I watched Day 2 (which in any event had most of the members I wanted to watch) and I had a really good time of it!</p>

<p>—– <strong>1147.4</strong> —–2023-03-20 19:34:24+08:00:</p>

<p>Yeah, for a good while audience vocalising at concerts was banned to limit COVID transmission. There’s quite a fun case of that in action, and creative circumvention thereof, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z8cx1u/japanese_idols_the_evolution_of_romantic_ukare/">described in this writeup</a>.</p>

<p>Elaborating a little internally, Hololive’s case, there’d already been some rulebreaking back in August when Mori Calliope did her first live concert and the ‘no cheering’ rule kinda went out the window by the last third or so; the ban was officially lifted by the time Suisei did her second concert back in late January, and the audience energy was <em>really</em> strong there, even on the stream.</p>

<p>I’ve gone back and forth between ‘meh’ and ‘I genuinely like it’ for Discovery, but I will absolutely concede that it has a considerable degree of premise whiplash. To some extent I think it’s fundamentally because the show’s function was to try and reboot the Trek franchise for the modern era, and so it kind of needed to do a lot to test the waters. So you have S1 as something intentionally a bit iconoclastic, S2 as something a little more callback-y, and S3 as something just completely different. What things worked and to what extent is very YMMV, but I feel like that was both intentional and unavoidable.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1147.7</strong> —–2023-03-22 04:33:54+08:00:</p>

<p>FWIW I don’t really like the current season, even if I agree that some of the ‘guff’ of S1-2 did deserve to be stripped out. It’s competently executed but in service of a story that to me seems utterly superfluous.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1147.8</strong> —–2023-03-22 05:46:59+08:00:</p>

<p>Didn’t help that they fired (I think) S2’s showrunners partway in, citing abusive behaviour, making S3 the first season which had the same showrunners from conception to execution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah but the Sex Pistols in particular were more nihilistic than anarchistic – indeed, ‘Anarchy in the UK’ was written as a mockery of anarchists. Crass or The Clash would stand out as actual anarchist or at least anarchist-leaning groups with some degree of actual idealism involved.</p>

<p>The fourth Hololive Fest (HoloFes for short) took place over the weekend, which was good fun. That said, the only parts I was able to catch live were the last few songs of the Day 1 concert and then the whole of Day 2; I have yet to get through the Day 1 VOD, haven’t yet watched the Holo*27 concert, and I’ve also not been as up to speed on the Expo as I was last year. But that’s due to a mix of business and jetlag for the most part. Now, this year’s HoloFes was drama-free and everyone agreed it was great – Hololive Indonesia and English’s respective second generations got to debut, everyone got themed outfits, <a href="https://twitter.com/hakosbaelz/status/1637442026240360448">Hakos Baelz absolutely slew</a>, we had a <a href="https://twitter.com/Marcus_Meneses_/status/1637421054028140544">MoRyS duet</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kanauru/status/1636982012916428802">Haachama made a chair</a>, it was all fun.</p>

<p>Which is why <em>instead</em>, I want to talk about <em>last year’s</em> HoloFes, on 19-20 March 2022. Because just over three weeks before, Hololive had terminated a member for the first time since May 2018. The full details of that incident have been adeptly narrated by /u/_dk in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/yzkffy/virtual_youtubers_identities_in_discord_the/">this post</a>, but reasons of space precluded the inclusion of this particular element of the fallout.</p>

<p>As was noted at the time, firing Rushia so close to 3rd Fes implied that the issues – whatever they may have been – were too serious to even temporarily elide, and for that reason, mild uncertainty hung over how the agency was going to deal with a last-minute lineup reduction so close to their flagship event. They themselves acknowledged that not everything could be changed in time, but that which could be changed generally was. Most obviously, Rushia was cut from the second day’s concert, which meant her solo was out, but the decision also had the collateral effect of also taking out her duet with Gen 2’s Nakiri Ayame – an especially unfortunate circumstance because Ayame had been dipping in and out of hiatus for over a year at that point, and 3rd Fes would have been one of her biggest appearances in an agency-wide event in a good while.</p>

<p>Merch would be a particular headache, as some were not as easily withdrawn as others. <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/9585/1443/files/K1K03d1Ddd372wKn.jpg?v=1647581661">Badges</a> and <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0525/9585/1443/files/bswiEwmxC9R48Dvp.jpg?v=1647581661">keychains</a> were relatively straightforward, but by that stage it was evidently too late to remove her from the <a href="https://cdn.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/607177388.jpg">playing card set</a> (she’s there as the 5 of diamonds); when it came to Hololive’s collab with TCG Weiß Schwarz, whose owner Bushiroad sponsored 3rd Fes, <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0550/5774/4071/products/HOLPBproductpage_e6d5a992-52c7-42de-b1d2-547e6873bcd0_533x.png?v=1662601075">already-printed sets and booster packs</a> were obviously not going to see Rushia excised last minute, although I understand that new runs since the firing have excluded her.</p>

<p>The Expo area also saw a change or two – the 2022 Expo featured a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQqafcQIwdM">costume lineup</a> where they had commissioned RL versions of the members’ outfits to put on mannequins, and Rushia’s rather obviously wasn’t there. But perhaps the more notable excision was in the <a href="https://preview.redd.it/z1w4i3bih9o81.jpg?width=1024&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7befe28af76e073a6d0136dc34eafeff666b699a">HoloJP group photo</a>, based on <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8msO7fL.jpg">a render that had been done when Kiryu Coco graduated (retired) the previous July</a>. What’s especially interesting is that not only did they remove Rushia, they also modified it to have Noel and Flare holding hands to fill the space in a bit, which I’m sure also gratified a lot of shippers. On the other hand, some items are supposed to have still featured Rushia, though at this stage I’ve not been able to easily track down what in particular.</p>

<p>And finally, the excisions extended to the advertising, where, on the poster outside the venue, there was a noticeable gap in the full cast lineup, thanks to the removal of Himemori Luna.</p>

<p>Yes, you heard me right. They removed someone completely different.</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/luna-got-accidently-erased-on-the-poster-for-the-expo-at-v0-b3p6lxpx9ko81.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7ab487f446fe6303a42bff33d703c3db764f8c6e"><em>And they kept Rushia.</em></a></p>

<p>This, er, did not go over too well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/tio7sq/luna_got_accidently_erased_on_the_poster_for_the/">The subreddit thread</a> had a mix of humorous ribbing and some deserved annoyance, but later on fellow Gen 4 member Tokoyami Towa <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbOEo7nR26k">would publicly call out the incident</a>. Nevertheless, there was general acknowledgement that the mistake was an easy one to make for someone who was simply contracted to do it: For one, Luna was third from left in the front row and Rushia third from right, which means if the directions weren’t fully clear (stage right, or right from the perspective of the characters?) then the mistake might have come about that way. Alternatively, it was the similarity of the names – the official Anglicisations of Rushia and Luna don’t seem to be that similar, but in kana they’d be るしあ <em>ru-si-a</em> and ルーナ <em>ru-u-na</em>, and if hiragana and katakana had somehow been mixed up, or the names were rendered directly into Romaji, then that could also have contributed.</p>

<p>But there is a bit of a happy ending here – in penance, some of the promotional material for the concert Blu-Ray would <a href="https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/2210/13/news182.html">feature Luna exclusively</a>.</p>

<p>I look at some of the 20mm minis I painted years ago, and while I continue to be impressed by some of my freehand work, I do think that being willing to do washes and shading – even in limited degrees – has helped my figures ‘pop’ visually for relatively minimal extra time. That said, my current major project is 28mm (for reasons of figure availability rather than any inherent attachment to the scale), so it’s comparing apples to oranges to an extent – things that are acceptable at 20mm simply don’t look that nice when scaled up some 50%.</p>

<p>I recall Headhunter Productions, a PNGTuber who used to do short-form bad movie reviews and now mostly does D&amp;D, was hacked a while back. I also recall there was a terrain-building channel along the lines of ‘No Game Without Terrain’ (or maybe that was the name of its series) that has since been lost to the void because it was hacked a couple of years after they ceased uploading.

<p>Huh, I completely missed The Discourse on that. RWBY pivoting from ‘the plot is there to give some tenuous backing to the fight scenes’ to ‘this is a worldbuilding-heavy show with a character focus and less fight stuff’ between V3 and V4 is pretty well known, so I wasn’t surprised about the writing-related comments on V8, which commits to the path set down from V4 onward. But I hadn’t heard about animation issues.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1147.17</strong> —–2023-03-26 10:49:24+08:00:</p>

<p>Oddly, CR has comments for RWBY going back to 2013, so I don’t know how recent that 4.5 rating is or if it’s genuinely the cumulative average over a decade.</p>

<p>So on the one hand, I do agree – there is nothing groundbreaking here, and the show’s let’s say slow-burn approach, short seasons, and long production lead times have not helped it in just falling behind of the rest of the web media scene.</p>

<p>That said, I feel like The Discourse isn’t so much ‘this is a step forward for representation’ as it is, ‘it’s really cathartic that it has finally happened.’ (Or should I say cat-heart-ic given that Yang’s logo is a heart and Blake is… er… look just ignore me okay)</p>

<p>Even by Volume 8 I wasn’t particularly involved in the FNDM anymore so the only people I was discussing it with were, like me, generally positive with some reservations, so I admit that at the time, I didn’t see many criticisms of the writing myself either.

<p>Oh sure, I’m definitely on board with the switch to Maya and the loss of Monty Oum leading to a notable decline/change in fight animation, I just don’t recall there being a lot of uproar specific to Vol 8. But as noted I wasn’t as FNDM-involved by that stage so point very much taken.</p>

<p>If you’re the sort that’s into modern recordings of historical music – particularly military-themed – then you may well have become aware of the more dubious elements of it. Now, my friend /u/IlluminatiRex wrote over on r/badhistory about a more insidious subject in the form of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/n21vqc/people_who_upload_german_wwi_songs_on_youtube_are/">neo-Nazis attempting to pass off fascist-written songs as WWI and earlier German music</a>, but I want to talk about something moderately more innocuous: the case of ‘The Dutch in the Medway’. If you look up that particular title, you’ll find a few uploads such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Lqds04eM8">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Lqds04eM8">this one</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdGZW2kD8-A">this one</a>, claiming to be an ‘English Folk Song’ or an ‘Anglo-Dutch War Song’. Now, the Dutch raid on the Medway in June 1667 did in fact happen – the Dutch sacrificed 8 vessels for use as fireships, in exchange for sinking 43 and capturing 2 of the English fleet at Chatham, which by that stage represented the bulk of the Royal Navy, including some of its heaviest ships. So the <em>subject</em> of the song isn’t dubious.</p>

<p>However, the lyrics are distinctly not contemporary. ‘The Dutch in the Medway’ started out as a poem by Rudyard Kipling, published as part of <em>A School History of England</em> in 1911, authored primarily by C. R. L. Fletcher with 23 illustrative poems added by Kipling. Even at the time, the book’s anti-Irish bent and overt subscription to colonial racialism were denounced by those in more liberal circles, and well you probably don’t need me to talk about Kipling as a whole. But the particular poem in question doesn’t really overtly get into those more unsavoury elements, and is instead a cautionary tale about ensuring that you keep your defence spending up. Of the three uploads I linked, only one acknowledges that this is actually an early 20th century poem, not a mid-17th century one.</p>

<p>None of them, however, credit the original tune, nor the person who decided to sing the poem to that tune. That tune is <a href="https://tunearch.org/wiki/Annotation:Cupid%27s_Garden">Cupid’s Garden</a>, which <em>is</em> actually relatively contemporary to the events, first attested in print in 1686 and thus probably even older. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9syk4KsxYQ">You can hear it sung here</a> by a quartet led by Jon Boden in 2011. What’s interesting is the question of how these two came to be linked.</p>

<p>The answer to that is the folk singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bellamy">Peter Bellamy</a>, who got quite a lot of mileage out of setting various Kipling poems to music, and whose particular compositions have been covered a couple of times as well. Bellamy believed, based partly on his own reading of the poems and partly from comments about Kipling’s writing process, that he often, if not always, had music in mind when writing his poems. In some instances, he claimed that Kipling was setting his poems to existing songs: in this particular instance, the line ‘Our ships in Portsmouth harbour’ at the start of the third stanza seemed to be similar to the line ‘‘Twas down in Portsmouth Harbour’ which opens the fifth verse of ‘Cupid’s Garden’, and in turn suggested that the poem as a whole was written to that particular tune. And to be fair, it <em>does</em> fit quite well. I’m not entirely clear on when Bellamy started performing ‘The Dutch in the Medway’ to the tune of ‘Cupid’s Garden’, but the first recording of it is on his 1982 album <em>The English Maritime Suite</em>, where it is sung solo to accompaniment by fiddle and piano, and it was then re-recorded as an <em>a cappella</em> duet for the 1989 album <em>Rudyard Kipling Made Exceedingly Good Songs</em>.</p>

<p>Bellamy actually set a pretty large number of Kipling poems to music that was primarily of his own original composition, mainly in four albums: <em>Oak Ash and Thorn</em> (1970), <em>Merlin’s Island of Gramarye</em> (1972), <em>Barrack Room Ballads of Rudyard Kipling</em> (1975), and the aforementioned <em>Rudyard Kipling Made Exceedingly Good Songs</em>. The only one I’ve listened to in full is the <em>Barrack Room Ballads</em>, which… look, there’s a not insubstantial of hard-r n-words copied wholesale from the original texts, and it is uncomfortable whenever one of those comes up. So that’s the fair warning before dipping in. But it was in listening through that that I first got clued in to some interesting things going on with a <em>different</em> song purporting to be one thing while actually being mostly Kipling, but the story there is different and requires me to do a lot more looking into it first. So stay tuned after the new thread goes up, I suppose!</p>]]></content><author><name>EnclavedMicrostate</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spinkcat在2023-03-13~2023-03-19的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-18/Spinkcat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spinkcat在2023-03-13~2023-03-19的言论" /><published>2023-03-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-18/Spinkcat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-18/Spinkcat/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>早期的确是集体处于一种农业社会主义的幻想里，结果被现实打脸。</p>

<p>但区别是负责一线行政的人，很快就意识到有必要调转方向，毛泽东也意识到有问题，能有限度承认错误。</p>

<p>问题就出在错了不改，只谈冒进问题，不谈路线是否一开始就有毛病。</p>

<p>最后变成官僚系统虽然一开始也错了，但后面要改没那么大包袱。</p>

<p>毛泽东的个人政治威望让他包袱太大，所以好几次会议，从南宁到庐山，都是本来反冒进和提出对这类问题的解决，结果就被他反咬一口，变成了反“反冒进”。</p>

<p>这个也有外部历史因素，毛泽东不是不能听进去意见，但他学习斯大林，并且在国内有无人可及的威望后，苏联那面却在去斯大林化，我认为这给他很大的心理负担，害怕自己路线出问题，失去政治地位，沦落到被清洗的位置。</p>

<p>不过从后续可以看出，官僚系统其实只是就事论事提出问题，但在毛泽东看来是潜在的挑战者，所以只是改一下路线的问题，下面各种议会都决议的七七八八，发到中央层面搞核心圈子开会，毛泽东就把风向按政治运动的整风方向推进。</p>

<p>邓小平在对毛的问题上，为了维护党政和自己反右的正当性，还是要留毛在党内的神圣性。</p>

<p>重点还不在于邓个人在国务院期间的事，他反右的一些人也明确不给平反，这些都是公开的，核心逻辑还是要确保毛的历史地位和党内威望不受损，这是整个政党都给毛泽东捆绑的结果，毛如果是利欲熏心为个人地位发动文革和坚持大跃进，个人利益与国家、政党利益冲突，选择了前者，那政治声誉和形象就无法建立起来。</p>

<p>所以只说是做错了，而不说实话是毛泽东个人立场没做错，只是做到了你们身上。</p>

<p>把毛泽东个人利益的得失等种种原因轻描淡写带过，不能把问题说明白，因为邓小平也是毛的得力干将，无法脱离为毛泽东办事的过去，因此变成了三七开，具体到大家都懂，毛泽东为个人政治立场和利益坚持路线不动摇，进而发动政治运动，也就当不存在。</p>

<p>变成了一种大家都有问题，毛主席也有问题，毛主席的一些做法是有错误的，但具体到为什么要这么做，英明的毛主席到底哪里跟官僚系统出现矛盾，这些从毛泽东在党内合法性的角度切入的东西，深究就影响到政权和邓个人政治利益的，能不谈则不谈了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2027.2</strong> —–2023-03-16 22:04:12+08:00:</p>

<p>这个确实存在的，更严谨的说法是中国与苏联的共产阵营领袖地位（社会主义路线）之争。</p>

<p>作为外因的原动力，大体是波匈事件毛泽东对苏联支持表态，加上中国的地位也日渐提高，阵营内部的主导权开始倾侧，中方认为苏联对西方是绥靖而有不满，尤其是路线矛盾，毛是更倾向于持续革命，苏共二十大的三和路线，毛不是肯定的那么积极。</p>

<p>但相对的，苏共二十大提出的去斯大林化，毛从他与斯大林政治上的关系，是积极的，但是细化到个人身上，毛自身也需要崇拜，怕这种反个人崇拜扩大，因此也是消极的，他也需要个人崇拜，所以怕斯大林的问题扩大化到他的利益范围。</p>

<p>所以可能看出，对斯大林的批判其实既有利于中共和毛，也不利于毛泽东个人对国内政治威望的构建。</p>

<p>苏共二十大后去除神性化，斯大林模式又实行太久，很多阵营内的国家和政党都走斯大林的道路和政治上的影响，因此政治压抑和干预的一面，早期去斯大林化是受到不少欢迎，但是也让阵营内产生了冲击，因为斯大林的威权形象被打碎，那么他们怎么看待苏联这一话题就被衍生出来。</p>

<p>中共和毛泽东后来给出的答案，用我的观点来看，就是”打碎了枷锁，获得了自由“，可以跟苏联老大哥争一争。当然，这个是外因形成对内的催促，希望形成一个社会主义阵营的榜样路线，有的学者可能更关注中苏关系这些外因对大跃进的促成，我个人是认为内因也不可忽视，大跃进的形成是多方元素组成的。</p>

<p>明的体制问题其实到后期虽然已经不可逆，但真正的催化剂还是崇祯本人，错误的对外策略，以及对内临危难时刻做出的判断，没有给南明留下一个稳固的领袖，造成各地各自为政，然后被清逐一攻破。</p>

<p>努尔哈赤在萨尔浒打出军事奇迹，表明明朝已经丧失从军户制度着手改善军事体系到指挥系统的机会，不大可能短期内遏制对方，崇祯接手后进一步破坏了该系统。</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia-Eurasia Center in Berlin.]</p>

<p>… Around 2003, Russia got lucky. The U.S. invasion of Iraq coupled with China’s spectacular economic boom led to a sharp increase in global commodity prices. The Kremlin’s coffers were suddenly flooded with revenues from the sale of oil, gas, metals, fertilizers, and other products on the global market. This windfall allowed Russia to quickly repay its foreign debts and nearly double its GDP during Putin’s first two presidential terms. Despite mounting corruption, most ordinary Russians found that their incomes were rising. Compared with their troubled imperial and Soviet past, Russians had never been so prosperous and, simultaneously, so free as in the first decade of the twenty-first century. With these strong economic and political foundations, Russia was well positioned to become a global power between East and West—benefiting from its links to both Europe and Asia, and focused on internal development.</p>

<p>Now, Putin has squandered all that. Driven by his growing appetite for power, Russia has been transformed into an authoritarian regime over the past decade, with Russian society and the country’s elite largely unable and unwilling to hinder the process. That transformation is largely responsible for Moscow’s failure to grasp these opportunities and redefine Russia’s world stature. Instead, Putin’s steady accumulation of power transformed a robust foreign-policy-making process, rooted in impartial analysis and interagency deliberations, into an increasingly personalized one. As a result, Putin and his inner circle succumbed to growing paranoia about perceived military threats from the West, and their decisions did not undergo the intellectual and institutional scrutiny they needed. Ultimately, this drove the nation into the strategic and moral catastrophe of its war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Trita Parsi, Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft; and Khalid Aljabri, an exiled Saudi cardiologist and health-technology entrepreneur.]</p>

<p>While U.S. President Joe Biden’s Middle East team was focused on normalizing Saudi-Israeli relations, China delivered the most significant regional development since the Abraham Accords: a deal to end seven years of Saudi-Iranian estrangement. The normalization agreement signed last week by Riyadh and Tehran is noteworthy not only because of its potential positive repercussions in the region—from Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen—but also because of China’s leading role, and the United States’ absence, in the diplomacy that led to it.<br />
Washington has long feared growing Chinese influence in the Middle East, imagining that a U.S. military withdrawal would create geopolitical vacuums that China would fill. But the relevant void was not a military one, created by U.S. troop withdrawals; it was the diplomatic vacuum left by a foreign policy that led with the military and made diplomacy all too often an afterthought.<br />
The deal represents a win for Beijing. By mediating de-escalation between two archenemies and major regional oil producers, it has both helped secure the energy supply it needs and burnished its credentials as a trusted broker in a region burdened by conflicts, something Washington couldn’t do. Chinese success was possible largely because of U.S. strategic missteps: a self-defeating policy that paired pressure on Iran with supplication to Saudi Arabia helped China emerge as one of few major powers with clout over and trust with both of these states.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2023-03-06~2023-03-12的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-12/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2023-03-06~2023-03-12的言论" /><published>2023-03-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-12/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-12/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>Hi there - we’re happy to approve your question related to your creative project, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists and the like, based on past experience: some people working on creative projects have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what’s needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it’s not always what you want to hear.</p>

<p>Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you’re asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don’t know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way.

<p>What’s interesting is that this reputation has persisted. At present, around 70% of Oxford’s annual intake are from state schools, with acceptance rates for both state and independent schools at around 20% (and actually slightly more generous to state schools). This is still a disproportionate figure given that 90% of UK secondary school students are at state schools, but speaking from experience the affluent toffs aren’t a particularly visible group these days.</p>

<p>我希望迭代速度能更快一些，几个月一代算很理想，但我希望能以星期为单位进化，对接更多领域，可以更有效提高生产力，现在还只是停留在问答阶段，希望能迭代到局部的智能程序执行阶段，游戏领域我感觉就是个很好的应用环境。</p>

<p>不过我没估计错，每个软硬件新领域和概念，都要有对应的数据库进行训练才行，不知道要猴年马月才能等到AI互相迭代。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2023.2</strong> —–2023-03-09 04:32:12+08:00:</p>

<p>有没有更详细具体一些的命题，中共与外部脱钩的社会经济背景我记得好像之前说过，但我忘了那个话题的命题了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2023.3</strong> —–2023-03-13 02:13:22+08:00:</p>

<p>我认为不可能完全脱钩，双方都是。</p>

<p>更严谨来说，应该说是重要的领域定向对中国封闭。</p>

<p>中国对外部依赖度更大，恰逢需要产业升级，过去通过各种商业手段或者行政方法来获取技术。</p>

<p>美国在奥巴马末期已经开始意识到，但是行动还没升级，只是用TPP（ 跨太平洋伙伴关系协定 ）作为应对的机制，当时还是以产业等级的排他性为目标，而没具体针对性，通过重新设置门槛，要求中方达到这个标准来倒逼中国改革。</p>

<p>特朗普则明显是错误的方向施力，大部分时间都浪费在跟传统盟友拉扯上，反而给中国不少时间缓冲。</p>

<p>但得益于美国不是一个决策层决定一切资源的国家，因此智库仍然能与政府其他部门合作来处理中国问题，比如一些技术间谍或者经贸纠纷，特朗普当时注意力则全都在对欧洲贸易上。</p>

<p>特朗普当时最错误的做法就是放弃TPP，导致CPTPP的诞生，浪费了几年时间，对中国还只是国与国之间的经济纠纷为核心。</p>

<p>TPP出来时，国内很多都在讨论，因为有观点认为TPP对中国经济发展会有很大影响，而国内舆论非常不屑。</p>

<p>因为特朗普当选，这个相对温和的框架被放弃，但拜登上台后就把矛盾上升到战略层面，贸易战把双方利益冲突的话匣子打开。</p>

<p>TPP没有实现温和倒逼，中国不愿意跟随改动，出来的特朗普则通过贸易战打开了战略冲突的序幕，到后面加剧时，拜登接手直接变成了战略冲突。</p>

<p>搞出了印太经济框架，这个框架我认为是TPP某一方面的升级，过去是要求经济升级才能进TPP，现在则是从战略遏制中国利用人口市场，也是为美国经济做缓冲。</p>

<p>经济结构上，中国到了人口红利末期，世界工厂还没完成产业的升级，仍然会有被取代的可能性，只是相对的会有少量站住脚跟的地方，可这些不足以让十四亿人达到发达国家生活水平，也不足以对抗老龄化和转型内需消费社会。</p>

<p>美国也不可能离开一个高产出的世界工厂，目前时代，世界上一定要有发展中国家以廉价劳动为红利，去大量的接纳订单。</p>

<p>这次美国瞄准的兑现是印度、越南等人口大国，且还是发展中国家。</p>

<p>扶持他们把中国的市场份额转移到其他地区，从而削弱中方经济话语权，也让美方不再依赖中国的出口市场（而不止是消费市场）</p>

<p>我觉得美国已经清晰有了一个认知，那就是中共的意识形态，决定了他们改革的上限，十四亿人的消费市场他们很想要，可是中共不会继续改革，以达到现代社会所需的产业升级标准。</p>

<p>相反会利用中国人口与市场优势，要挟国外来换取存续的时间。</p>

<p>因此剥离中共，区分中国人民（市场）就成了必要手段。</p>

<p>现在虽然直接表达不多，但我认为美国的路线，是希望通过将中低端制造业转移到印度和越南，提前刺激这种自然转移的产生（如果没有中美矛盾，那就是中国持续升级到完全内需社会转型，然后本国人口成本太高，因此物价的价格转移往，但扩散范围会更大，因为中国有十四亿人口，会产生二十亿作用的劳动力需求）</p>

<p>提前刺激转移发生，意味着中共能获得分配给基层的资源减少，财政问题会开始浮现，通过内部矛盾，倒逼中共要么改革，要么被内部问题压垮推翻。</p>

<p>而目前中共的选择是打死不改革，对内加强权力收缩和控制，但是要想办法突破产业升级达成内需社会，后两者我们知道是做不到的，因为哪怕美国的一些技术与关键领域端口，都在逐渐闭合，现在已经闭合的七七八八，还在进一步加速。</p>

<p>一旦中共不能从高端产业链的国家获取技术和管理经验，而外部世界仍然快速发展，内部就会出现明显的停滞，这种停滞我认为还没来（进出口下跌可能只是短期的一个状况，我们要看三到五年中长期才有稳妥数据）</p>

<p>尤其是现在全球正在处于下一次工业革命的风口上，AI、机器人、AR/VR等都征兆废除明显。</p>

<p>国外技术想进入中国吃市场红利，依然是被中共阻挠和控制，总是希望要求有国内代理公司，从而获得技术和数据，最后在这方面无法达成和解，国内的产品也难以有效走入全球市场。</p>

<p>中共通过大幅度加紧控制，比如香港，来避免意外出现，香港仍然发挥一个中国市场对外接驳的角色，但只要中共不放弃当下的政策，如果印太框架成功，新加坡的受益将远远大于香港，而本身香港也是可以大幅度受益的。</p>

<p>美国的TPP的排他性建立在进入标准上，因此给许多国家留下了选择权，而且产业有限，印太经济框架则是复合型，扩大到了整个经济层面，没那么多条条框框。</p>

<p>最吸引人的可能就是贸易、供应链弹性，对美国好，对印度和越南等国都好，基础设施反而是跟中方竞争的一个领域，意在减少中方控制，增加自己主动权，避免美方拉起了经济，基础设施反被中方控制无法战略效率最大化。</p>

<p>大体上来讲就是TPP→贸易战→印太经济框架</p>

<p>跟中方参与的RECP不同，印太框架的战略属性性更强，RECP经济性质更浓，中国也不是唯一提倡国，而印度退出，基本就形成了一个新冷战格局。</p>

<p>RECP可以当作中方与东盟的一种地区阵营，但是很多国家又同时有CPTPP身份，想两面吃红利，比如日本、澳大利亚这也的美国盟友。</p>

<p>美方的战略主动则是印太经济框架，立住了印度作为中方的对冲角色。</p>

<p>所以能看出，外部事务上，中方选择余地不大，还没有或不能提出一个可以对抗印太框架阵营的战略阵营，更多是把这种集成方案，拆分成多个定向的协议。</p>

<p>一带一路框架从战略和政治属性来看，大体是失败的，现在的RECP经济属性更强，但美国也拿出了印太经济框架。</p>

<p>如果未来印太框架真正意义上产生了影响，未来中国也许也会拿出一个类似的战略阵营框架，目前看是俄罗斯、伊朗，但穷哥们没啥用，东盟是最大的贸易伙伴，属于在崛起的新爹，还两面吃，靠不住也得罪不起。</p>

<p>中方也建立这种战略对抗体系时，虽然不会完全脱钩，但也意味着正常的经贸合作算是到头了，现在中国经济不好，疫情折腾三年，外加政府内部财政压力，似乎没能力也不会拿出一个对抗性的战略阵营。（如果亚洲和澳洲没戏，只能想办法学美国，跨太平洋跟中美到南美国家联合，尤其是巴西，也是中国主要贸易伙伴，但远不如东盟、欧盟和美国。）</p>

<p>未来三十年，东盟地区会迎来中美双方投入资源，以及到了自然发展节点的快速增长，即便不完全倒向美国，也会成为平衡地区关系的关键，本世纪内将变成跟欧盟一样的国际重要政治实体。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2023.4</strong> —–2023-03-15 02:30:12+08:00:</p>

<p>帝国主义亡我之心，只是内部拿来树立外部敌人的说法，纯粹是以政权角度出发思考。</p>

<p>很多人脑内自动与政权利益捆绑，完全忽略了政权的认受性。</p>

<p>虽然打不倒，但是西方国家真被打倒了，对中国只有坏处没有好处，因为中国是十几亿人口的庞大国家，需要海量的出口订单和就业机会。</p>

<p>没有了消费产业链里的上游市场，全球没有其他任何发达国家可以承担中国的经济增长需求，包括进口维持国内生活。</p>

<p>哪怕贸易上当他们透明人不存在，也可以参考前三十年中国的经济状况。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2023.5</strong> —–2023-03-17 06:15:27+08:00:</p>

<p>没多大影响，只会倒逼进步。</p>

<p>中国虽然客观上依赖外部影响，但外国人不会派人到中国来解放中国人民，中国土地上的人只能靠自己。</p>

<p>中共的财政基础来自于庞大的进出口贸易，拉动的资产价格增长与经济热度，欧美一旦遭遇经济危机，波及是全世界的，订单、投资都会下滑。</p>

<p>中国也要跟着一起受冲击，08年时已经被迫出台四万亿，看起来伤害不大是因为后续的经济增长能一定程度抵消，但是消化四万亿的负担不但没有被时间填平，中共反而常态化作为刺激经济手段。</p>

<p>远到郁金香危机，或者工业革命后的英国经济危机，上个世纪的大萧条，欧美基本都在：</p>

<p>经济发展→繁荣→危机→市场出清→恢复→发展→危机的循环里不断度过。</p>

<p>按照时间来算，现在再次出现全球性的经济危机也不意外，差不多也该出现了，但大概率会以新形式诞生，基本每次金融或经济危机都会在法律、认知层面触及一些盲区，然后被补上</p>

<p>比如大萧条，人类社会和机构还没普遍意识到货币供给量的问题，但现在是常识。</p>

<p>欧美如果没有充足订单，但东南亚和印度又有足够多的接盘代工厂，对中国经济可能更加不利，因为过去起码还没有足够替代品，现在竞品越来越多，国内改革速度却跟不上转移速度。</p>

<p>最糟糕局面是人家转移完了，我们还没升级完，没升级不说，产业先发优势被淡化，不如日韩那么明显站得稳，同时下游竞品压力过大，以至于企业没足够利润转型，在这种局面下中共崩了，财政被他们耗光未来几十年的储备，债务与人口危机同时爆发。</p>

<p>虚弱或强大的欧美，都有不同可能，强大的欧美如果不对中国提出主权、经济权、海权干涉议案那自然是最好的，否则虚弱的更符合中国利益。</p>

<p>因为强大的欧美要么可以作为民间组织的资金来源，用于在地方权力真空时快速做大，要么能在新政权上台后，提供超高金额的低息贷款，去填补中共留下来的烂摊子。</p>

<p>现代逻辑上跟鸦片战争时期提出主权干涉的可能性很低了，所以理论上是越强越好，因为他们也依赖十几亿人的市场，互惠互利，中国发展几十年但无法转型发达国家人口，对他们也是相当大的投资损失，他们越强大，就越有额外资金用于投资或者借贷。</p>

<p>因为中共留下来的烂摊子，目前基本可以确定是极其庞大的财政缺口，没有太多已知国内渠道能填补。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2023.6</strong> —–2023-03-18 15:45:37+08:00:</p>

<p>我觉得不是缺陷，而是一种良性秩序，允许社会有弹性结构去应对通胀、通缩。</p>

<p>任何一次现代经济危机，如果是因为通胀引发，社会都必然会有充足的利润盈余，在进行投资过热化后，在某个节点因为特定因素崩盘产生连锁反应。</p>

<p>这是对市场的出清，是有自我调节机制的一种经济结构。</p>

<p>利润盈余往往被拿来投资，如果没有这些投资，市场上不会有那么多新兴企业。</p>

<p>经济结构一定需要有弹性，来应对新兴市场的出现和过热，允许市场自身进行调整，就跟堆沙子到一定程度肯定塌一样。</p>

<p>实际上我观点觉得这不是人为设计的，而是先验行为不断拓展出来的一个环境，没有超脱出人的天性里自发行为的范畴，所以总是能逻辑自洽。</p>

<p>生产资料公有制，大跃进时期的问题就冒出来了，它在当代是个人为设计的产物，且大概率不受后验修正，一旦出问题就是人道主义危机，而不是经济危机本身了。</p>

<p>经济自身的繁荣程度，会伴随人口和科技增长不断出现变形，经济危机就跟蜕壳一样，允许市场上的资源自我调节，然后流向新领域。</p>

<p>公有制我认为是个发展结果，而不是过程里必然的制度，中共高层不大可能以一次经济危机为依据去判断欧美制度不行，只是不想改而已，因为进入市场经济后，中共自身就遭遇了多次经济危机，随后外部也有多次经济危机，要是觉得不行，早就应该知道，不至于迟到08年才反应过来。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2023.7</strong> —–2023-03-20 05:29:08+08:00:</p>

<p>传统意义上的公有制可能不严谨，更大层面来说是共产主义。</p>

<p>我认为人类社会发展有三个阶段</p>

<p>第一阶段是农业社会，生产力最低，权力是主要媒介。</p>

<p>第二阶段是工业社会，生产力进阶，金钱是主要媒介。</p>

<p>第三阶段是共产社会，生产力爆炸，道德与个人实现是主要媒介。</p>

<p>社会发展会伴随多次技术进步，带来的生产力奇点，而人口不能无限增长，全球进入发达化后，人口都会进入老龄化状态，但生产力不断进步。</p>

<p>新的AI技术证明了未来潜力，那么哪怕根据现有技术推断，本世纪末都大概率出现早期的基本收入制度雏形，在一些最发达的国家进入公共政策。</p>

<p>然后有一个过渡范围，基本收入足够人去有非常好的生活，但是人不会一直闲着，而是有追求和学习，这个过程里担当的工作就会有更高收入，去获得更多更贵的产品，实际上现在也有这个情况。</p>

<p>一些发达国家和地区，靠政府援助的最低生活指标，的确是可以活的但谈不上足够好的质量，未来这个标准进一步扩大，最低生活指标不断提高，变成基本收入，我想是会在本世纪下半叶有苗头的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2023.8</strong> —–2023-03-21 19:15:13+08:00:</p>

<p>日本政府是个对内逻辑自洽的存在，这就决定了经济运作和债务，对内是个行政问题，而不是政治问题。</p>

<p>如果真的撑不住，日本政府可以停摆，减少非必要部门的运作，保留必要部门，社会在维持基本治安和治理的情况下，不会陷入到各地揭竿而起的动荡危机里。</p>

<p>中国的政府停摆，会直接带来政权更替，因为中共并非靠选举上台，在经济问题和社会问题频发时，会被无限的问责直到要求下台，而中共是坚决不愿意下台的统治阶级。</p>

<p>而且政府结构也不允许，分税比例在全球各地都有，但是中国的分税制，是头重脚轻，完全收缴地方财权，事权不对称。</p>

<p>地方的立法权被收缴，权力来自于上方，意味着本地没有自行选择方向和裁决的独立决策权，那想发展必须依赖中央政府政策。</p>

<p>这就造成了一个问题，地方发展不能依靠自己，财权也不在自己手里，还必须接受中央摊派的政治任务。</p>

<p>就不可能通过短期贷款提供一个高质量政策，吸引人口回流，因为户籍制度限制人口迁徙，人是跟着政策走的，地方没有自主政策权就无法处理问题。</p>

<p>那么地方没有足够的钱，不能自行决策发展，又要管理绝大部分人口和负责开销，这种结构久而久之，一旦遇到外部压力就会加速脆化。</p>

<p>很容易进入地方政府公共服务收缩，进而出现权力真空的局面，加上中共自身不具备法理稳定社会的基础，经济牌跟地方维稳同时垮台，等于下台前奏。</p>

<p>举债为什么不能无限扩张，因为地方举债，就算滚雪球不还债，当税了。</p>

<p>但是利息必须要还，而地方稳定能不扩大债务还利息的手段，只有税收。</p>

<p>所以举债空间不是来自于还能举债，而是还能还多少利息而不至于让政府停摆。</p>

<p>偏偏分税制下，税源被中央控制，地方只能拿到一些不怎么样的税源，比例还不够高。</p>

<p>假设维持政府运作是100%的财政基准线，一旦利息超过这条线，政府就等于无法运作，因为到时候税收可能都不够还利息。</p>

<p>美国的债务结构就是联邦政府背最大的债，州到地方有自己的财权与决策权，允许人口流动，这样各地既有权力按照自身意愿和财政能力推出竞争政策，还不至于被债务压垮，联邦政府则提供全国性的公共服务，进行一个全方位覆盖。</p>

<p>所以人口问题不是最大问题，而是人口平均产值、消费能力，日本已经是发达国家，除了早期自己蠢坑了自己留下的门槛外，即便不是高速增长，内需消费社会的建成也能让他们有稳固的税源，抗外力能力增强。</p>

<p>政府的长期存续形成了债务信用的认受性基础，中共的呢？</p>

<p>最主要的是，日本的债务认购来自于国内，而国内有稳定的基础，政府可以赤字运行，中共虽然也是对内认购，但没有内需社会，并且缺乏长期稳定的基础，意味着日本的债务模式，放到中国问题更大。</p>

<p>日本自己坑自己，所以财政上选择不多，所以现在日本的债务问题严重，但这是一个经济或者说行政危机，而不是政权危机。</p>

<p>中国产业可以在某些领域站稳脚跟，这个是毫无意外的，但能不能全面的形成一整套文化、经济、科技与新兴产业并进，类似日韩崛起时形成的繁荣期，从而让全国都进入发达人口的消费水平，这一点是存疑的。</p>

<p>前半部分还好说，但唯独全国都进入发达社会，这是有疑问的，因为明显现在的产业升级和站住的地方，完全不够。</p>

<p>基础产业转移即便没政治因素，也会随着发展带来的成本问题而发生。</p>

<p>日本和四小龙，是先发展基础产业的同时，条件允许就发展高端产业，从而在基础产业退潮后，形成内需消费社会，为内部中基层劳动力带来劳动岗位，而不需要依赖外部设厂。</p>

<p>所以国内单独靠汽车手机产业，不上不下的话是不行的，但就算形成一种全球垄断地位，也不够养活全国人口。</p>

<p>任何社会政策，如果是要维护政权本身，而不利于多数民众的，必然会有执行成本，做多了就慢慢把自己和民众对立起来，清除低端人口就是个例子。</p>

<p>因为人民是既要经济增长，也要生活水平，没有经济增长，起码得到一定基本保障的程度，而要提供这种保障，政府不但要交出财权下放，还要建立一个内需消费社会。</p>

<p>人口问题带来的是对应产业的不健全，日本也有这种问题，不过他们已经是内需消费社会。</p>

<p>我们上无产业下放利润，下无低成本劳动力继续与印度东南亚竞争，内无内需社会建成，处于一种什么都在做，但都没有达到质变临界点的程度。</p>

<p>不上不下其实是最困难的，坚持维持出口主导，就很难形成中基层的劳动收入增长去建成内需消费社会，且上游产业必定受限制。</p>

<p>还会随着时间推移，被迫跟印度、东盟甚至非洲的廉价劳动力竞争，所以不是出生人口减少这么简单，而是社会发展到一定程度，却没有合理转型，限制企业和地方权力，限制中基层劳动待遇和社会地位。</p>

<p>相当于社会发展是一个不断前进的实体，这些限制有利于统治阶级的存续，但是却是在阻碍该发展实体在正确时间抵达正确位置。</p>

<p>基础产业转移是合理的自然现象，人口老化也是，但其他国家能处理是因为他们正常发展，有了新的社会基础与工具去应对，一个孩子八岁穿小鞋，十八岁还穿同一双鞋，错过发育期就变小脚了。</p>

<p>顺着历史规律发展，社会与政府会有新工具去改善问题，但过渡到下个社会形态，中共就原地灰飞烟灭了。</p>

<p>执行力抗历史规律又扛不住，还阻碍社会发展，如果真能抗住，中国永久性处于出口主导，起码还是不断有订单的，但客观规律就是成本会不断提高，无法避免。</p>

<p>这也是为什么说中共是个卡位的存在，他们治理的非常烂，高不成低不就，政治拖经济后腿，逐渐变成拖整个社会发展，乃至在全球的竞争力。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2026.1</strong> —–2023-03-13 04:04:02+08:00:</p>

<p>因为中共长期处于路线矛盾的斗争状态。</p>

<p>从毛泽东开始到习近平，每一代都跟上一代并非出自同一利益派系，或者后续利益矛盾，未遵从上一代的要求。</p>

<p>一直都是中共内不同派系的人，互相拉扯，在某些利益上达成一致，某些则无法达成政变的结果。</p>

<p>毛泽东留下内外两个组成，华国锋和汪东兴等搞掉了毛泽东嫡系。</p>

<p>因为文革不得人心，华国锋在去除毛泽东文革留下的政治产物。</p>

<p>华国锋后来被邓陈体系排挤边缘化，这是改掉了毛泽东的经济体制，拔除在行政体系内的继承人，彻底放弃了毛的模式。</p>

<p>邓陈后来又在经济体制上发生分歧，陈希望走鸟笼经济和政治保守，邓希望市场经济。</p>

<p>胡赵本来能接班，但是推行改革过程里，跟邓发生了严重分歧，因此被废除。</p>

<p>江上位，是背靠陈云与李先念，在经济政策上靠拢他们，最后被南巡敲打，邓陈和解告终。</p>

<p>胡温则是邓安排给江的钉子，除此之外还有朱镕基等一堆改开老干部。</p>

<p>习上台也是妥协结果，但江的扶持也很重要。</p>

<p>胡的双退是党内少有按规矩办事，这换来了与习近平的蜜月期，但没想到第三任期开始后，习近平按照惯例反水，把团派扫出了核心权力圈，没有保留让团派担任国务院的控制权。</p>

<p>习后续还有吗？大概率没了，除非习死后复刻毛泽东的遭遇，留下两个班底，一个是坚决继承维护共产党体制的党国威权主义，另一个是国务院干活的工具人。</p>

<p>然后工具人政变拿下党务，复刻华国锋和邓的情况。</p>

<p>要么就是习一口气干到政党崩溃，后续就没规律可言了。</p>

<p>所以可以看得出，权力体系交接，一直并不是一个派系内的传递，而是不同派系时而妥协，时而动干戈的结果。</p>

<p>从四人帮、毛远新，再到华国锋汪东兴叶剑英，然后邓、胡赵，再到李先念、陈云，这四组深究的话，核心利益是互相对立的，只不过邓陈能达成妥协和一致性。</p>

<p>江李、胡温继承了邓陈的对抗，然后结果是陈云一系胜出。</p>

<p>习近平上位，团派不行了，而且可见的未来没法翻盘。</p>

<p>毛派最早内讧出局，周的国务院派随后胜出。</p>

<p>国务院派内战里，邓取得了经济胜利，陈取得了人事胜利。</p>

<p>然后就出现现在的奇景，经济前几十年持续开放发展，政治上却越来越收缩。</p>

<p>江胡时期为代管的技术官僚阶段，派系路线矛盾减少。</p>

<p>但随第三梯队里的红二代成长，国务院派的分类不再实用。</p>

<p>转而变成了技术官僚与红二代的内部矛盾，最后以技术官僚被边缘化告终，红二代则自己建立了一个新的技术官僚体系，原来的（团派）被废用边缘化。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2026.2</strong> —–2023-03-15 02:26:50+08:00:</p>

<p>我尽力而为</p>

<p>—– <strong>2026.3</strong> —–2023-03-16 22:11:27+08:00:</p>

<p>不清楚，还没了解。</p>

<p>地方机构一般都喜欢和稀泥，大事化小，小事化无，降低社会维稳成本，不一定是中共的主观政令产物，而是缺乏对行政机构肃正职能而出现的职能缺失，我觉得反例就是美国警察的职权，丢命的事也真去干，职能被充分发挥。</p>

<p>再有就是机构自身可能在职能缺失的时候，采取的视角是认为男性被一个弱小的女性打几下没多大损失的逻辑，而息事宁人可以减少他们的工作，并且降低执法成本，因为他们的逻辑里可能默认对女性执法的成本更高。</p>

<p>遇到不可控的突发事件，建议能躲尽快躲，无论男女，走得快好世界，走得慢满身伤害。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2026.4</strong> —–2023-03-17 07:03:01+08:00:</p>

<p>刚好，我对未来其实更感兴趣。</p>

<p>第一条问题我的观点是，中共自身对社会体制的干预，让产业无法对应速度发展，很难达到同效率的研发速度。</p>

<p>中国目前在最新领域上还是可以跟上，但是就量级与核心技术来讲，还不足够未来在跟上之余，保障十四亿人口的产业。</p>

<p>ai起码要等在互联网前言和实业基础两个层面有较大影响，才可能带来质变，目前进步很快，不过影响不至于短期见效。</p>

<p>但放大到十年到二十年，就是一个工业革命的落差。</p>

<p>这个过程里我不认为中共会完全落后，而是速度越来越慢，现在改革开放虽然实质性可以算是政治上结束了，但中后期的发展惯性还很强，在VR和一些技术前沿，中国还是跟进了，即便做不到技术核心，这也是产业链庞大的优势。</p>

<p>因为很多大厂零件都要从本地出，能组合搭配就可以有一定累积，这是一些小的国家没有的优势，比如日本，日本的下一代MR显示屏技术，整体落后于美国，但也是世界前沿，可是到了整合产品的终端，就没有能拿得出手的品牌了。</p>

<p>还有挺讽刺的是，做AI和做下一代显示技术的人，不少看领英都知道，是国内出身，人家都润出去了，不得不感慨国内难留顶尖人才，虽说也不是没有，却不能普遍性地尽其才。</p>

<p>中共借用改革开放的惯性，还能滑行数年到十年，但是到十年这个周期末期，可能就落差比较明显了。</p>

<p>这个惯性在前言产业，比较明显的是游戏方面，开发行业正在愈发成熟，独立于审核体系的发展，相当于掐死瓶口但是瓶子里面越来越繁荣，能开始逐渐跟上世界前沿，但是外部市场可能走的更远。</p>

<p>尤其是下一个风口到来时，只能说暂时是滞后劣势当中仍然进步，因为还没法判断AI能带来多大的生产力革命。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>第二个问题， chatgpt4本身我没接触过，实际上我没直接接触过任何最近OpenAI的这些AI衍生物，因为很多都要候选资格，必应的我参加了，但懒得看过没过，因为AI的实际应用注定会到来，我这个人贪方便就懒得刻意去靠拢。</p>

<p>AI对未来生产力革命这点我反而是靠拢最多的。</p>

<p>实际上我看到OpenAI宣布 chatgpt4后就在思考了。</p>

<p>第一，我是不认为不会有人失业，但这种失业不是可怕或者不可抑制的。</p>

<p>第二，我认为AI是生产力革命，迭代越快越好，因为现实要覆盖的范围、定义过多。</p>

<p>第三，AI会是人类个体的辅助生产工具，未来每个人的计算机设备里都会有一个独立甚至多个AI运转。</p>

<p>有人认为可能失业，我认为在完全新兴事物、产业与现实社会融合的过程里，无可避免会出现一些过热现象，比如工业革命淘汰掉部分的纺织工。</p>

<p>的确也造成了失业冲击，但最后是解放更多人的生产力投入服务产业。</p>

<p>包括写代码也是，AI可以做人力无法覆盖的范围，而定向修正所需的表达，AI未必能精准。</p>

<p>或者这么去理解，一个AI如果能替代20个工人，带来20单位的产能，那么20个工人实用AI辅助，生产效益可能是400，甚至500或者600。</p>

<p>对比之下，刻意去淘汰掉员工进行节省，并不会带来更高产能，相反让人手辅助AI，或者AI辅助人工，人均产能只会增加。</p>

<p>AI同时会带来更多的产能需求，产品最重要的是销售价格和市场，假设产能暴增，平均成本大幅度下滑，意味着消费者在市场可以买到的产品价格会耕地。</p>

<p>政府也会遏制利润暴增而最低工资不涨的情况，也代表着收入会增加。</p>

<p>世界上许多消费品的市场有限，往往是价格限制，而价格又基于生产效率和成本。</p>

<p>我们如果能把这个生产效率最大化，成本尽量降低，市场只会更大。</p>

<p>全球还有至少40亿的发展中人口市场，要是AI降低的开发成本和生产效率增长，能将物价降低到即便价格下降，利润也依然有高增长的市场范围，对所有人都是好事、</p>

<p>商家扩大十几亿人口的市场，利润率增加，成本下降。</p>

<p>雇员的工作压力减少，收入增加。</p>

<p>消费者的可选产品增加，商品价格下降，生活水平提高。</p>

<p>也即是说，提高生产效率的本质，是扩大经济活动与交易密度。</p>

<p>10亿人口市场，，其中只有5亿能消费得起，商品价格是10元，人均收入1000元，能交易100次。</p>

<p>10亿人口市场，AI辅助生产，商品价格是5元，人均收入不变，能交易200次，现在可能就是10亿人都消费得起。</p>

<p>覆盖的面积增加了，实际的贫穷问题也可以被减少。</p>

<p>这个例子在现代工业社会就有体现，现代意义上社会的城市里的基层，跟古代意义上的比，是穷还是富？</p>

<p>答案毫无意外是更富了，如果对应社会整体的收入趋势不变，但是社会基层却可以享受更多消费品、肉类、电子产品和部分奢侈品，这就说明其生活质量的进步。</p>

<p>AI的应用端口非常多，软件端的生产力革命就有很多，材料暴力测试、科学论文、药物测试、医学数据模拟、可以极大量的减少工作量。</p>

<p>而且长远来说，不会减少工作岗位，因为AI无法自己选定课题，人类拓展的领域太多，需要这些领域的”科技民工“作为实用AI的人来干活，AI就相当于赛博电钻或者大锤，这是工具更加锐利高效，还没到人被工具淘汰的时候，工具还不能自我劳作且得到超越人类的普遍效果。</p>

<p>实用产业端，我认为AI有一个对社会生产力最大的改变，会来自于农业，尤其是自动化农场。</p>

<p>其实我几年前在SUB里谈过AI对农业的影响，生物本质就是一套模板，AI可以更好的找到一些模板来培育，并且可以通过自动化农场全年不间断生产，甚至可以做到无人工厂。</p>

<p>一旦这种全自动化的立体AI农场出现，就会永久性的改变人类文明，城市-农村的二元结构会彻底消失。</p>

<p>到时候所有劳动力都会集中在城市从事服务产业，食物价格会非常低廉，而现代食物成本，最典型的就是白羽鸡，极其便宜且多功能化。</p>

<p>工业化再进一步，AI化，利用垂直与地下空间，可以做的事太多了，比如一些不能饲养的鱼类，有了联通AI的硬件设施后就可以做到，离岸渔场全AI自动监管，星链数据传输，更别提交通方面，AI会革命性的推动自动驾驶进一步成为可能，当然，这里展开太远不赘述了。</p>

<p>在全AI机器人出现前，绝大部分地方都要用轨道或固定机器人配合AI来工作，因此一些必要工作仍然需要人类来完成最后一步，毕竟工作是人与人对接，AI的汇报可能都不在法律上有效果。</p>

<p>总体来说，我认为AI的普及，一开始会有一段磨合期，会造成一定失业，但是慢慢的，社会与企业会发现，AI与人的工作混合会更有产出效率且精准。政府扮演的角色就是保障下限，禁止随意裁员，提高裁员成本，遏制企业的恶意裁员，并且不断拉高最低时薪，进行大量立法。</p>

<p>而AI带来的产出盈余，会进一步降低生活成本，扩大生活的娱乐、消费、工作质量，并且给全球更多人带来就业（更年轻的年龄层），太老了无法对接的，或者无法转行的，则会成为自动化收益的受惠者，政府的在这方面多赚的钱，可以用于他们身上。</p>

<p>并且，我认为伴随AI、自动化等的进一步增长，核聚变、立体农场的逐渐形成，被自动化淘汰的人群会形成对基本收入提倡的一个先声群体，逐渐在本世纪后半叶或末期成为公共政策。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2026.5</strong> —–2023-03-20 04:47:05+08:00:</p>

<p>我是很欢迎AI的迭代的，一方面能加速生产力发展，另一方面也为中共加速。</p>

<p>只要不发生真正意义上的AI危机就没问题。</p>

<p>生产力的进步前面提到了，政治上他们肯定会寻求用AI在政治上获取好处。</p>

<p>但这种东西基本会外包给特地企业，即便有审查，我也不觉得有什么问题。</p>

<p>因为能把技术应用到那么荒唐的程度，也必须要有一个非常庞大的执行机构。</p>

<p>他们想要完成这个政治维稳的执行，核心负责AI的机构人数肯定有限，那么延伸出去负责执行，逮捕公民、跟踪和维护各种AI给出指标的基层，就是个天文数字了。</p>

<p>更主要的是，如果大众得知了这种情况（如果大规模应用肯定会知道），只会进一步刺激民众的内心情绪，最终达成加速。</p>

<p>有什么比给中共自身财政增加负担，还能让民众不便而反感更好的加速呢？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>至于AI的广泛应用，未来十到十五年，应该会伴随大量的新兴技术结构，应用在不同领域，我觉得农业是个可拓展范畴非常大且影响深远的领域。</p>

<p>如果我们能尽快压低农产品价格，就可以用更低价格喂养更多人口，从而让出更多收入比例投入服务和工业品消费，也就能创造更多市场。</p>

<p>双向的在发展中国家降低食物消费，扩大发展中国家的岗位数量，在发达国家带来更多消费动力，一些相对高价格的新兴科技产品能被负担，从而推动头部技术发展。</p>

<p>普通科幻作品里AI的应用平时大家都看太多，我反而不是太常谈，更多关注的是议论较少的农业AI应用，控制每个零件在精准时间点灵活变化，计算机视觉来通过大量的摄像头判断人眼无法看到的东西，达到更高效率的无人化生产。</p>

<p>不过目前我很担心国内全方位跟不上，立体农场一旦其他国家先完成，即便不用技术壁垒，光是价格就会压垮国内的中小农户，在我看来这就是农业圣杯，跟文明系列里的奇观一样。</p>

<p>我们十四亿人，农民规模太大，如果立体农场进行无人化播种、收割、模块化建筑后，我们的农民要承受外部价格挤兑，并且技术淘汰现象严重。</p>

<p>要是我们没有足够大且深的产业链护城河，靠内需消费建立一个独立于外部出口的经济循环，会有上亿人失业，而且还是那种种地都没活路的情况，因为沿海可以轻易进口大量来自国外立体农场质量更好甚至更便宜的产品。</p>

<p>现在不但没做到全国农业机械化，产业升级到安全区域也还看不到头，长远而言，我们对技术的利用效率可能会逐渐下降。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-03-06~2023-03-12的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-09/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-03-06~2023-03-12的言论" /><published>2023-03-09T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-09/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-09/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Putin’s halfway strategy has scored some notable successes. Throughout 2022, for example, the Russian economy was not hobbled by excessive militarization or government control. To the contrary, Russia’s economic contraction was smaller than most Western analysts predicted. Moreover, the strategy also helped Putin maintain a fine balance between tightening the rules and not alienating Russia’s economically active urban middle class. For their part, many ordinary Russians have been glad to ignore the war as much as possible, and the Kremlin’s strategy has skillfully played on these feelings: it has allowed many Russians to pretend that they will not be affected by the war.<br />
Indeed, the strategy has also been aimed at those who fled into exile. Many Russian men who went abroad to avoid being mobilized have since been signaled that they will not be punished at home if they return. On February 1, for example, Russia’s Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov reported to Putin that 9,000 “illegally mobilized citizens”—people who are supposed to be exempt from mobilization because they perform critical jobs in IT or in the banking and financial system—had already been returned home. The Russian authorities are also seeking ways to lure the country’s exiled IT specialists—which it needs to sustain the war effort—back to Russia. The government has promised workers in this category exemption from the draft and a free plane ticket home. Putin knows his people well: some Russians, desperate to believe there is a way back to prewar reality, are returning to Russia thanks to this strategy.</p>

<p>Instead of galvanizing efforts to address deep structural problems in European defense, the war has only reinforced them. European forces are in worse shape than previously thought, and weapons stockpiles have necessarily been depleted to support Ukraine. As Europe seeks to rearm, it is finding that its defense industries aren’t fit for purpose. Efforts to coordinate European procurements are not working, with countries all going their own separate ways, adding to the general dysfunction. The United States has demonstrated its indispensability to European security and confirmed Europe’s dependence on Washington. European leaders have seemingly accepted this as the natural state of affairs, with many declaring the pursuit of European “strategic autonomy” dead and turning their backs on cooperation with other EU countries. The momentum in favor of reform and change that had built up over the last decade appears to have vanished.<br />
Although proposals exist for addressing these problems, none offer the kind of sweeping initiative that would be necessary to fix them. In short, a broken status quo prevails.</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Suzanne Maloney, Vice President of the Brookings Institution and Director of its Foreign Policy program.]</p>

<p>Despite the challenges, trying to salvage the deal made tremendous sense for Biden. The president was eager to shake off the United States’ post-9/11 entanglements in the Middle East, and he wanted to show the world that after the tumultuous Trump era, Washington was again committed to diplomacy. Resurrecting the deal was central to Biden’s plan for restoring U.S. leadership in the world—a tangible step toward undoing the reputational damage incurred by Trump’s abandonment of the agreement.<br />
But as the boxer Mike Tyson once said, “Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face.” And Biden’s Iran aspirations have suffered from multiple blows. The first came in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and irrevocably shattered the great-power coordination that had enabled the nuclear deal to take place. A second punch landed in August, when Iran began shipping drones to Russia, making Tehran an even more prominent and harmful nemesis. And a third blow arrived in September, when protests erupted across Iran against the government’s brutality, captivating the world, undermining the regime’s control, and making any agreement that would send Tehran massive new resources both dangerous and unsavory. By itself, each of these jolts was enough to keep JCPOA on the ropes. Together, they constituted a knockout.</p>

<p>Yet so far, the Biden administration has not seriously rethought its Iran policies. Consumed by the war in Ukraine and competition with China, the government has instead sought to navigate this new environment with purposeful ambiguity, offering symbolic support to the protesters while soft-pedaling (but not publicly disavowing) the prospect of a new nuclear accord. This strategy may temporarily prevent a crisis over Iran, but it cannot indefinitely stave off disaster. Indeed, the stalling may invite a crisis by encouraging Iranian brinkmanship or Israeli impatience.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-02-27~2023-03-05的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-05/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-02-27~2023-03-05的言论" /><published>2023-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-05/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-05/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Cochrane is evaluating the research, as it exists.  They find the research inadequate to support the claim that masks make a difference, for COVID transmission.</p>

<p>The studies supposedly reaching the conclusion that masks, in fact, do make a difference are unreliable for various reasons.  Cochrane explains why.</p>

<p>This matters because we cannot make claims about what something does, when we do not have evidence to support the idea we’re advancing.</p>

<p>This matters because it rejects the premise that most people have been incorrectly caused to believe as axiomatic: that masks not only make a difference, but they are critical to prevent COVID transmission.</p>

<p>It would be like if I sold you a drug to prevent cancer, but the data from all of my clinical trials found no such benefit.  I think we can all understand doing that would be very bad.</p>

I want accountability for those in my field who knew better than to ever mislead the public with the bullshit that Cochrane is calling out.   We (i.e., folks in the field) knew better and dropped the ball, over and over again.</p>

<p>You’re right!  Nothing in science is ever final.  We try to reach the best conclusion we can with good evidence and reliable methods.  But sometimes folks drop the ball. They reach unsupported conclusions with terrible evidence on unreliable methods.  That is what happened here.</p>

<p>It is possible that further research may be undertaken.  And that research might reliably find that masks make a difference.   As it stands now, there is not now nor has there ever been good science to back such claims.  That’s the point of the whole article.</p>

<p>The update is primarily addressed at the people whose comments were removed, which is worthwhile and I’m glad you linked it.</p>

<p>According to the update:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be accurate to say that the review examined whether interventions to promote mask wearing help to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, and that the results were inconclusive. Given the limitations in the primary evidence, the review is not able to address the question of whether mask-wearing itself reduces people’s risk of contracting or spreading respiratory viruses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a finding would require <em>clear</em> trends in the data.  But clear trends are not found in the data related to all of the mask research, which is why the results were “inconclusive.”  In plain english, inconclusive results mean  that <em>neither surgical masks nor N95 masks have been shown</em> to make a difference in reducing the spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses.</p>

<p>Many people do not understand what a Cochrane Review is.  And above all, what a Cochrane Review is <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>When scientists want to know something, they either do their own test or look at tests other scientists did before. Scientific research is when scientists do their own study to answer a specific question. It’s like when you do an experiment in science class to see what happens when you mix different chemicals.</p>

<p>Meta-analysis is a bit different. It’s when researchers take information from many different studies and put it all together to get a bigger picture. It’s like if you wanted to know which school had the best sports team, instead of just looking at one game, you would look at all the games they played throughout the whole season to get a better idea.</p>

<p>A Cochrane Review is a type of meta-analysis. A Cochrane Review <em>is not</em> a type of publication that reports the results of first-hand research (research conducted by the authors themselves).  A Cochrane Review is, as the name suggests, a <em>review</em> of the research that is published.</p>

<p>The key problem with most of the comments here is simple: they incorrectly concluded that this was just another piece of research that could be weighed on equal grounds, with every other preprint that ostensibly found either surgical masks or N95 masks made some kind of a measurable difference in reducing the spread of COVID-19 (or other respiratory illnesses.</p>

<p>But that is not the case, either.  Science does not begin from the presumption that something is true, when there is no evidence for it (as the review plainly states).  The vacuous claims of public officials who should know better are no substitute for evidence, even if they may deceive a terrified and gullible public.</p>

<p>I agree with this.  Despite the fact that student debt is crippling the economy and making new generations of indentured servants, a series of folks (most of them Gen X-ers) feel like others should have to bear a ‘the same’ weight as they did. The problem with that view is that Gen X-ers did not have to bear the same weight as Millenials and Gen Z.  Tuition rates were profoundly lower and the underlying amounts they borrowed was a lot less.</p>

<p>And then there’s the issue of that guy from Dirty Jobs, Mike whatever his name is (Rowe?), who seems to know less than nothing about the subject.  His position is that it is unfair to forgive the debt of borrowers because that means you’re using tax money from people who chose to get jobs in the trades right out of high school.  That argument has a lot of practical appeal, but only to the ignorant.  That is not how student loans are funded in any sense.</p>

<p>Your comment assumes the essay was poor.  This would be a fair assumption, for most undergraduates (and graduate students).  But it is an irrelevant assumption here.</p>

<p>Here is why your assumptions are wrong:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The “professor” identifies no specific fault with the content, structure or layout of the paper.  Instead, the professor references pedantic usage issues (that may or may not exist), without identifying them.  It is not even clear the professor correctly identified the issue, present in the paper.</li>
  <li>The professor complains about editing, while failing to cite a single specific example beyond No. 1.  The paper could have been replete with typeos, citation errors and the like.  Or it might have had three total typeos across the sum of the pages the professor claims to have “read.”  The scale cannot be ascertained from this incoherent “feedback.”</li>
  <li>The “deal” is not specified.  Clearly there was no meeting of the minds, when the “professor” can’t even recite what the expected obligation was.  This looks like arbitrary “I don’t like this so fuck off” type feedback.  Which I assume it was, based, again, on the context of the prompt.</li>
  <li>“Fully engaged” is a bullshit term that incompetent people use, when they want someone to fail but want to appear like they’re encouraging someone to become successful.  If you see that on a performance review, it’s time to look for a new job because no matter the degree of your effort someone has it out for you.</li>

<p>It is beyond obvious many commenters here simply have not had the experience of dealing with people like this kid’s professor.</p>

<p>The analysis that matters here is less forensic than genomic.  Specifically, genomic sequencing.</p>

<p>If a virus was subjected to artificial selection pressures for either transmissibility or virulence, that could be inferred from its genomic sequence.  By analyzing the genetic makeup of different viral strains and identifying patterns of mutation, recombination, and selection, the inferences can be drawn about the virus’s evolutionary history (including the degree of similarity and dissimilarity with track records of known pathogens, in nature).</p>

<p>The mutation rate of a virus can vary greatly depending on its genetic makeup. RNA viruses, for example, tend to have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses due to the error-prone nature of RNA replication. By analyzing the types and frequency of mutations in a virus’s genome, researchers can estimate its mutation rate and use this information to infer its evolutionary history — potentially even the point at which a coronavirus that occurred in nature was deliberately enhanced.</p>

<p>For example, phylogenetic analysis is a method used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between different organisms based on their genetic similarities and differences. By comparing the genomic sequences of different strains or isolates of a virus, researchers can construct a phylogenetic tree that illustrates the evolutionary history of the virus.</p>

<p>Also, the genomic structure of a virus can provide information about the selection pressures that it has faced over time.  To illustrate, if a particular gene or protein has undergone numerous mutations, this may indicate that the virus has been under strong selective pressure to evolve in response to changes in its host environment.  In some cases, inferences can even be drawn about that host environment.</p>

<p>If a virus is under strong selection pressure, it may evolve more rapidly than a virus that is not under such pressure. Researchers can estimate the evolutionary rate of a virus by comparing the genetic sequences of different strains or isolates, and this information can be used to infer the strength of selection pressures acting on the virus.</p>

<p>One might also look for non-synonymous mutations.  Nonsynonymous mutations are changes to the genetic code that result in an amino acid substitution in the protein encoded by a gene. These types of mutations can alter the function of a protein, and can be indicative of selection pressures acting on the virus.  If a virus that normally infects one species is found to have nonsynonymous mutations in genes that are involved in host recognition, this may indicate that the virus is adapting to a new host species.</p>

<p>Suppose you were trying to enhance transmissibility.   You’ve got three ways to do it, basically: increased infectivity, replication and transmission.</p>

<p>RNA viruses can be modified to increase their infectivity, or the ability to enter and infect host cells. This can be achieved by introducing mutations in viral genes that are involved in host recognition and entry. For example, the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein is responsible for binding to host cells and initiating infection. By modifying the HA protein, researchers can increase the affinity of the virus for host cells, thereby enhancing its infectivity.</p>

<p>RNA viruses can also be modified to enhance their replication, or their ability to produce more virus particles within host cells. This can be achieved by introducing mutations in viral genes that are involved in replication or by introducing additional viral genes that promote replication. For example, the insertion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in other coronaviruses can increase their replication and infectivity.</p>

<p>RNA viruses can be modified to improve their transmission, or the ability to spread from one host to another. This can be achieved by modifying viral genes that are involved in transmission, such as those that affect viral shedding, stability in the environment, or host range. For example, modifying the M protein of the influenza virus can increase its stability in the environment, thereby enhancing its transmission.</p>

<p>On the other hand, suppose you were trying to enhance virulence.</p>

<p>RNA viruses can be modified to introduce pathogenicity factors, which are molecules or proteins that contribute to the ability of the virus to cause disease. For example, the influenza virus can be modified to introduce the NS1 protein, which helps the virus evade host immune responses and enhances its virulence.</p>

<p>RNA viruses can also be modified to enhance their ability to infect and cause disease in new host species. This can be achieved by introducing mutations in viral genes that are involved in host range or by adapting the virus to grow in new host cells. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is thought to have originated in bats, has been shown to be highly adapted to humans, with mutations that enable it to bind more effectively to human host cells and evade human immune responses.</p>

<p>Further, RNA viruses can be modified to increase their resistance to antiviral treatments, such as drugs or vaccines. This can be achieved by introducing mutations in viral genes that are targeted by these treatments or by introducing additional viral genes that promote resistance. For example, the hepatitis C virus can be modified to introduce mutations that confer resistance to antiviral drugs.</p>

<p>None of this is speculation.  It’s the story of a virus’s evolutionary history, told through the structure of its genetic material.</p>

<p>I am not saying China weaponized COVID, because I don’t think they did (and I don’t think the evidence supports any such claims). However, there is no doubt in my mind that a virus like COVID-19 could never have come about in nature. Viruses simply do not evolve like that.</p>

<p>For example, a highly influential paper in this field was published in 2015 in the journal Nature Medicine, titled “A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence” by a team of researchers led by Zheng-Li Shi at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>

<p>This paper described the discovery of a new type of coronavirus, named SHC014-CoV, which was found in horseshoe bats in China and was similar to the SARS-CoV virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak. The researchers conducted gain-of-function experiments with the virus in which they modified its spike protein to see if it could infect human cells. The modified virus was able to infect human lung cells and replicated more efficiently than the original virus.</p>

<p>The authors concluded that the findings raised concerns about the potential for the virus to jump from bats to humans and cause a new outbreak similar to SARS. The publication of this paper has been cited in discussions about the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as it originated in bats and has a spike protein that is highly similar to that of SHC014-CoV.</p>

  <p>those concerned with ethics will be more comfortable pointing towards blameless causes (zoonotic) than causes implying blame (anything human). This is a good response and should be encouraged, particularly in non-scientific spaces (that’s you, me, the government, and the press).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Basically true.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) Even if they had jurisdiction, they were not allowed to collect information at the scene in Wuhan. All information they had was from other sources because the CCP refused to let American government auditors or investigators in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) A forensics lab is not useful without active samples.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forensics don’t matter here.  Active samples don’t matter here.  What matters is a sequenced sample of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and what can be determined from that information.</p>

<p>This is not a forensic analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, the OP could’ve argued that the FBI could’ve interviewed virologists, evo biologists, etc, but chose to highlight the lab side of things that wouldn’t be useful. Therefore what the OP argued for was speculation from the wrong group and amounted to armchair speculation by the FBI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They should have just sent a sample to Jonas Salk Institute, the University of North Carolina or somewhere equipped to sequence and analyze it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lab leak theory is possible, but not probable, and the reason it was dismissed early on was because it didn’t track with the vast majority of the data at the time showcasing a separate track of very common animal-human vectors already in progress at the wet market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the argument the Chinese government made, which everyone took at their word, because the alleged data supporting this proposition was never released to the world.  If it even exists.  Which is questionable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corona viruses in bats don’t need human interference to evolve dangerous or deadly traits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shellenberger has no experience in the field of virology or epidemiology and isn’t a useful person to even acknowledge when talking about this topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a weak, logically fallacious argument.</p>

<p>The epidemiological “data” provides absolutely no support to the claim that COVID-19 did not emerge from the WIV.</p>

<p>Frankly, this isn’t even a question within the toolkit of an epidemiologist to answer.</p>

<p>A virologist might have undertaken the gain of function research which created the COVID-19 virus, but they’re not in a position to draw inferences concerning its evolutionary history from its genetic information.  That’s a little bit different from virology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should know, I’m experienced in clinical research (including site audits), my sister’s a virologist now working on Covid, and my mother’s an epidemiologist. We’re not talking out of our asses when we all agree the OP’s article is a puff piece with no merit on the topic except to further confusion in the lay public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experts can have opinions, but their opinions need to be relevant and credible.</p>

<p>Your family can tell the world how they think the virus spread.  But none of you are in a position to determine where it came from.  The data you would need to make such claims simply was never collected by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>But even if it was collected, it likely would be wrong anyway.</p>

<p>No, I think you do.

<p>So in other words, the fact that the game has <em>already</em> been used to fund anti-trans causes shouldn’t stop you from promoting it? Even if further purchases of HL don’t <em>immediately</em> go into royalties cheques for JKR, they do still prove the viability of the brand, and thus <em>more</em> royalties down the line.</p>

Nevertheless, it is my opinion that people should be informed of the causes that the game’s beneficiaries promote, and I <em>do</em> take umbrage with anyone a) unwilling to engage with that in good faith, and/or b) who will go ahead with promoting the game despite knowing about those issues that have already been enumerated.

<p>I’d like to tack on to what was written by /u/iwaka with a paragraph from an ultimately half-formed answer that I never got round to finishing before they wrote theirs (which in any event gets into a lot of things that hadn’t even sprung to mind for me):</p>

<p>To just highlight a few differences of vocabulary here: The Classical verb for ‘to want’, 欲 (<em>yu4</em> in Mandarin, <em>juk6</em> in Cantonese), is <em>incredibly</em> rare in vernacular usage in Mandarin and Cantonese, outside of idiomatic phrases; it does, however, persist in some other languages such as Hakka and Hokkien. In fact, you’re far more likely to see it in Japanese, in noun form as 欲 <em>yoku</em> (desire, want) or in adjective form <em>hoshii</em> 欲しい (desired, wanted). Mandarin and Cantonese speakers today would be far more likely to use 要 <em>yao4</em>/<em>jiu3</em>. The Classical verb ‘to say’, 曰 (<em>yue1</em>/<em>jyut6</em>), is <em>entirely</em> literary. Some Sinitic languages such as Cantonese instead use 話 (<em>wa6</em>), while Mandarin uses 說 (<em>shuo1</em>); both also use 講 (<em>jiang3</em>/<em>gong2</em>) as well (there are dialectical variations in terms of which Mandarin use 說, 講, or both; ditto for 話 and 講 in Cantonese varieties.)</p>

<p>Institutional access, you say? <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZsjVCjF">Don’t mind if I do…</a></p>

<p>I’ll let people who actually understand demography do any interesting analysis that may be done, but I can confirm that Durand is correct when he says that Balazs noted that the number of prefectures counted was halved in the 760 census. In his notes column, the 734 to 754 censuses are remarked as covering between 315 and 362 prefectures depending on the year, whereas the 760 covers a mere 169 prefectures – worthy of an exclamation mark!</p>

<p>His later figures are also worth remarking on, I feel. For 763 he finds a figure of 9 million families – an <em>increase</em> from before the rebellion – which he explicitly highlights as a contemporary estimate, with yet another exclamation mark! Evidently the later sources still suggest a considerable decline in at least reported families, which only recovered to just shy of 5 million by the mid-9th century, but as you note, it’s difficult to suggest that this reflects <em>deaths</em> rather than administrative disintegration.</p>

<p>I’m sure someone with a better grasp of academic German can elucidate on the footnote for 760, but Balazs does note that, if his figures can be extrapolated to include the half not under rebel rule, then that would still constitute a considerable population loss in the empire as a whole, with the number of families having halved even within the assessed territory.</p>

<p>That is, however, a big if, and I would think that were he to have gone into greater depth, then the apparent increase in individuals per family (from about 5.5-6.0 to 8.78) might suggest that the decline in actual population was not as severe as the decline in taxpaying households. I would also be interested to know <em>which</em> prefectures stopped being counted, as An Lushan’s forces primarily operated in what would have been the empire’s metropolitan heartlands in the north Chinese plain. It’s entirely conceivable that the fact that it was relatively densely-populated regions that fell off the administrative map also served to exacerbate the effect in the statistics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>!More specifically, FallenShadow was a friend of LemonLeaf, both ASMR creators; the latter of whom started streaming as a VTuber in May 2020. In the summer of 2021, when Hololive English’s second generation, Council, was debuting, FallenShadow did several vagueposts on both Twitter and Discord alleging betrayal by one or more close friends. LemonLeaf had recently announced a hiatus, and then on 23 August, Hololive debuted Ceres Fauna, who had a suspiciously LemonLeaf-esque voice. FallenShadow never explicitly said that her posts had been about LemonLeaf/Fauna, but given her own indie VTuber debut around the same time, many have assumed she was bitter about not getting the Hololive audition.!&lt; However, at least publicly the two have appeared to be on good terms, with appearances in chat on each other’s streams; as such some have said the counter-criticism isn’t particularly warranted.</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Andrew Bacevich, Professor Emeritus of International Relations and History at Boston University and Chair of the Board of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, which he co-founded.]</p>

<p>The past two decades might have functioned as an extended “Suez moment” for the United States. But the U.S. foreign policy establishment has refused to move on, clinging to the myth that what the world needs is more American military power. The failure in Iraq did not prevent Washington from doubling down on its “good war” in Afghanistan—an act of rashness that culminated in a chaotic, humiliating withdrawal in 2021.<br />
That spectacle could have served as an occasion to declare an end to the era defined by World War II, the Cold War, and the aspirations to which they gave rise. But thanks in no small part to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the moment soon passed. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has revived the postwar tradition of American muscle flexing. The Afghan war, the longest in U.S. history, has all but vanished from memory, as has the disastrous war of choice that Washington launched 20 years ago in Iraq. Partly as a result, the country seems poised to continue making the same mistakes that led to those debacles, all justified by the ostensible obligations of global leadership.</p>

<p>The war in Ukraine might offer one last chance for Washington to learn a Suez-style lesson—and without even suffering a defeat. So far, U.S. policy on Ukraine has been pragmatic and arguably restrained. But President Joe Biden and his team routinely talk about the war in ways that suggest an outmoded, moralistic, and recklessly grandiose vision of American power. Aligning his administration’s rhetorical posture with a sober assessment of the true stakes involved in Ukraine might allow Biden to wean the establishment from its obsession with hegemony. Demonstrating that Americans do not need their country’s role in the world explained to them in the style of a children’s bedtime story would be a bonus.<br />
The danger is that the opposite could happen: Biden’s framing of Ukraine as a crucible for a new era of military-backed American dominance might lock him in, and his administration’s carefully calibrated policy could come to more closely resemble his soaring, ill-considered rhetoric. That, in turn, would lead to an altogether different and more disastrous reckoning.</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Eric Schmidt, Chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and former CEO and Chair of Google.]</p>

<p>Ukraine’s success can be credited in part to the resolve of the Ukrainian people, the weakness of the Russian military, and the strength of Western support. But it also owes to the defining new force of international politics: innovation power. Innovation power is the ability to invent, adopt, and adapt new technologies. It contributes to both hard and soft power. High-tech weapons systems increase military might, new platforms and the standards that govern them provide economic leverage, and cutting-edge research and technologies enhance global appeal. There is a long tradition of states harnessing innovation to project power abroad, but what has changed is the self-perpetuating nature of scientific advances. Developments in artificial intelligence in particular not only unlock new areas of scientific discovery; they also speed up that very process. Artificial intelligence supercharges the ability of scientists and engineers to discover ever more powerful technologies, fostering advances in artificial intelligence itself as well as in other fields—and reshaping the world in the process.</p>

<p>The ability to innovate faster and better—the foundation on which military, economic, and cultural power now rest—will determine the outcome of the great-power competition between the United States and China. For now, the United States remains in the lead. But China is catching up in many areas and has already surged ahead in others. To emerge victorious from this century-defining contest, business as usual will not do. Instead, the U.S. government will have to overcome its stultified bureaucratic impulses, create favorable conditions for innovation, and invest in the tools and talent needed to kick-start the virtuous cycle of technological advancement. It needs to commit itself to promoting innovation in the service of the country and in the service of democracy. At stake is nothing less than the future of free societies, open markets, democratic government, and the broader world order.</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Jacquelyn Schneider, a Hoover Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution and an affiliate of Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation.]</p>

<p>Since the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon has invested in technology that limits casualties but does not decrease the cost of manpower. It has spent heavily on expensive and scarce technologies for first-strike offensives, largely ignoring the effect of such expenditures on its ability to fund wars and to secure supply chains. Thirty years into this technological push, the United States lacks the technology and resources to maintain support for Ukraine at present levels, much less to deter China from invading Taiwan.</p>

<p>Now that these weaknesses have been revealed, they deserve serious attention. The difficulties the United States has faced in meeting Ukraine’s weapons needs hint at the far greater challenges Washington would likely confront in maintaining its edge in a war fought with more cutting-edge battlefield technologies. A clear understanding of the historical relationship between technological change and war suggests that the United States should urgently prioritize technology that reduces not just the political costs but also the economic costs of war.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spinkcat在2023-02-27~2023-03-05的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-03/Spinkcat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spinkcat在2023-02-27~2023-03-05的言论" /><published>2023-03-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-03/Spinkcat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-03-03/Spinkcat/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>反而是有人依然采用或陷入国内内宣回护的党国叙事逻辑，把这种吃力不太好还祸害几代人的决策，当做是打击美帝国主义的壮举。</p>

<p>朝鲜战争还导致本来可以缓慢进展的社会主义改革，因为对外与美国敌对，导致中国与欧美战后为主的市场断轨。</p>

<p>中共建政早期本身并不打算立刻就跟历史上一样高强度整顿，反而打算很大程度容许市场与资本的存在，这也是陈云的鸟笼经济的根本。</p>

<p>但是外部市场彻底封闭，进而刺激了国内的矛盾与逼改进程，结果后来社会主义国家里的苏联核心，在后来还与中国交恶，我们没捞到足够多的好处，反而承担了长期资本与社会主义国家的双向封闭，还有数十万国人的伤亡。</p>

<p>如果跳脱官方的叙事，可以看得出这一系列操作就跟我们现代看鸦片战争一样蠢。</p>

<p>实际上犯错不怕，人不可能不犯错。</p>

<p>但毛走错一步后，对问题的反应每一次都是错的，跟合作对象不断走向对立。</p>

<p>表面有利于自己，实际却是祸害集体，最初从阶级敌人到可拉拢的资产阶级。</p>

<p>然后是老大哥，再到内部的战友，然后是接班人们，慢慢扩大到全国。</p>

<p>所以说，毛在四十年代末或五十年代刚开始时死了，他的评价会好不少，建政期间的杀戮还是斗争，因为时代背景会被另论。</p>

<p>唯独建立政权后，毛的决策几乎是一步错，步步错，能每次都错也是神奇，说明他这个人的立场与利益已经与社会发展互相抵触了。</p>

<p>也因为毛与中共的建政权威绑定太深，导致党内即便意识到了毛个人立场带来的问题，以至于无法转向，也没有任何安全或可执行的渠道去换掉毛，哪怕林立果政变都提及毛威望太高，不是特别建议直接杀死。</p>

<p>到邓小平时代也遇到这个问题，哪怕明面上已经是全面否定毛泽东的制度和价值观，但仍然不能做到完全否定，还要三七开来为政权的合法性做论述，也说明中共建国的法理根基很薄弱，而这个薄弱除了意识形态上站不住脚根，还要很大程度问题来自于毛的对外判断失误，引发的一系列激进政治矛盾。</p>

<p>国内吹捧毛，多数其实不是认真称赞毛个人在中共建政时的正确决策。</p>

<p>而是在以古代王朝吹捧开国皇帝的口吻一样。</p>

<p>但我们是一个现代国家，毛泽东也不是皇帝，所以这些吹捧如果放到一个公开公平的舆论环境，根本就经不起推敲，国内毛有人追捧，很大原因是不让说黑料，也缺乏公开讨论的余地。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2019.2</strong> —–2023-03-02 14:25:45+08:00:</p>

<p>建政时期毛体现出来的地方，的确是很有能力的，判断正确路线正确，但主要还是农村包围城市的生存路线问题，所以毛泽东在路线选择上的正确的褒奖大抵没问题，且最终导向的结果都是有利于政权的。</p>

<p>至于考虑环境，没有西安事变和日本入侵，中共大概率是活不下来进行发展的，但西安事变有一定蒋介石自己作出来的成分，张学良兵谏后中共能利用起来也是运气的一部分。</p>

<p>很多时候国内其实是不大接受或者允许中共运气成分的，尤其是张学良和抗日问题。</p>

<p>张学良说他不抗日，所以国内风评不好，但是没张学良中共就没机会在西安事变后翻身，这就处于两难局面，因此国内出现一种没有西安事变，中共也能安然生存且发展壮大的话术，其实按理来讲是不大可能的，即便没被完全消灭，也不可能发展到内战的规模了。</p>

<p>而抗日战争这个大背景更是不能提，毛自己其实到很坦然，但是现代为了维护中共的历史叙事观的神圣性，必须强调中共是中国人民的选择，宣传教育上大有淡化国军，放大中共，但嘴上又没说是中共一手领导全国人民抗战，故意造成一种他没说，让你以为是他领导的这种错觉，等你回过味来还不能说他摘桃子。</p>

<p>国内其实就不是很愿意敢于正面谈这个事实，因为要维护中共是人民选择的这个宣传，就必须刨除客观因素。</p>

<p>客观因素是什么呢，蒋介石抗日消耗巨大，基本怕在江浙一带遭兵革屠戮，到后面已经没钱了，跟中共发展地方后有充足财源对比，实际并没有太多优势，续航能力不足。</p>

<p>然后犯了几个错误，导致没有资源补救，国民党就无可避免的败退下来，输在财政上，其实知乎早期讨论有很多人是认真描述了这个客观情况的。</p>

<p>但国内的宣传话术，就必须描述为是中共军队料事如神，总是出其不意能打赢，更早期长征时期的比如四渡赤水。</p>

<p>包括林彪和毛泽东等人指挥的战术和战略决策，的确是很漂亮的判断，我其实不反对称赞这些客观上的事实，只反对国内的主观历史叙事话术，这种刨去客观环境的描述，其实对人们了解历史并不有利（比如国军围剿方案和蒋介石军事作风刚好正中毛的风格下怀）</p>

<p>因为单方面主观夸奖过高，一旦你的政权失势，这种话术失效，本来可能很不错的教科书战役，如四渡赤水，就又被人恨乌及乌逆反心理给踩低，就像现在对蒋介石军事能力要扁低到运输大队长一样。</p>

<p>但是当时很多人其实不知道，就是想办法跑路求存而已，并非预先设计，而是到了正确的时间做了正确的事（但老实说，就这，很多时候一群人都做不到），四渡赤水就算是一个例子，后来被强调，是因为这是以毛泽东的视角作为军权巩固的一个象征，而毛与中共的成功绑定，所以毛泽东的军事叙事观，也自然成为中共的军事叙事观。</p>

<p>就好比蒋介石围剿说他怎么都玩不过中共，可能吗？肯定不正确，否则中共不用不断转移跑路。</p>

<p>那为什么一直难以围剿？因为蒋介石所处的位置，只能靠整合大规模兵力进行地毯式扫荡，才能逼迫中共转移或消灭，而前几次蒋介石动员兵力有限，又依赖地方兵力，蒋介石又不是地方武装，他一时也抽不出手调动大量资源。</p>

<p>等到后面蒋介石开始大规模动员，走一步一个脚印的徐进战略，稳固好避免中共反复迂回，开始走堡垒战术进行逼近筑“墙”，中共主力就只能进行转移，被逼到没办法只能铤而走险进行长征。</p>

<p>所以49年前，其实毛泽东或中共、蒋介石与国民党，许多本来正确或精彩的操作，一旦涉及到49年后建立政权的政治正确与历史叙事神圣性，全都会被戏剧化，进而出现失真。</p>

<p>人们追捧的是这种失真带来的归属感，而不是真正从历史角度是感受当时事态的发展来用上帝视角作评价。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2019.3</strong> —–2023-03-02 15:16:39+08:00:</p>

<p>大跃进的历史链条其实很简单。</p>

<p>朝鲜战争导致美国对中国开始全面贸易封锁，但是战争之前，建政初期，中国的进出口总额有66.5%来自于欧美这些资本主义国家。</p>

<p>而中共建政早期，并不是说跟后来宣传一样跟私营经济势不两立，而是预期有一个很长的过渡期。</p>

<p>那什么导致这种过渡期瞬间结束了？</p>

<p>就是因为朝鲜战争的经济问题，导致资源短缺，而中共要反制裁美国的禁运政策，这个时候就需要控制私营企业去配合，然后不断加码，最后政治化，演变成了强制公私合营与赎买现象。</p>

<p>三反五反就是配合朝鲜战争背景，外部贸易与进出口问题被堵死，导致内部产生一系列变化的一种政治运动，用来名正言顺给各类社会主义改造提供政治正确。</p>

<p>到后面百家争鸣、百花齐放的双百，现在的人说是毛主席真伟大，故意引蛇出洞。</p>

<p>其实就是没想到之前朝鲜战争后内外部环境变化，执行了的加速社会主义改造，居然有这么多党内外人士反对，说引蛇出洞只是给自己脸上贴金找台阶而已。</p>

<p>到五十年代后半段，没有了对外贸易的资源输入与本地出口，内部生产上，私营经济逐步被取代，短期掠夺的资源让政权有了一种可控的感觉，但发展却开始减缓（因为负责生产消费的个体与企业都被控制了），就需要想办法让政府干预增长，而实际上他们大部分人并不懂经济。</p>

<p>大跃进本身大家都知道了，我这里不赘述。</p>

<p>到后面内部回过味，发现不对劲，开始有人反冒进，但毛泽东一直对反冒进心里不大喜欢，甚至后来南宁会议开始反“反冒进”，负负得正了等于。</p>

<p>再到庐山会议上，本来是纠左，结果变反右，彭德怀等人被处理，对党内是一个很严重的事，因为第一彭德怀并不是跟毛对着干，而是去捋顺毛驴，只是提意见。第二彭德怀说的没错。第三彭德怀朝鲜战争结束有威望，党内地位提升的明显。第四就是党内过去虽然是毛说了算，但大体还是有集体商议的。</p>

<p>庐山会议直接把这个四点全部扣死，硬是打成反党集团，并且是以反对大跃进名义坐实的。</p>

<p>这就直接把大跃进这辆车的油门踩到底，一直到出问题大饥荒才反应过来肯放弃。</p>

<p>但是放弃的体现，最终是从刘少奇等人，再到行政部门上反馈上去的，在毛泽东看来这就是彭德怀第二。</p>

<p>这就变成了行政端国务院官僚和毛的个人利益得失的问题，国务院的官僚系统希望从理论和政治上解决名不正言不顺的问题，刘少奇的身份就很重要。</p>

<p>但推行的政策三自一包，按毛泽东的定性就是想搞垮社会主义。</p>

<p>毛这里还认为实行社会主义与无产阶级，不能没有民主集中制，而民主集中制的最大受益者就是他个人。</p>

<p>因此到后期，就变成了三自一包背后带来的东西，实质性是否定毛泽东的三面红旗与个人利益。</p>

<p>刘少奇从位置上来说，只能是源自于工作和行政角度考虑，也是对毛泽东捋顺毛驴，但任何有潜在威胁的行为，都被毛泽东视为威胁，然后就不断加码处理，到最后公开化上纲上线。</p>

<p>从这里开始就变成了一个系统性问题，对于刘少奇本身，毛泽东之前把他扶的太高，想拉下马要做的文章和运动规模也必然非常之大，彭德怀在庐山会议被处理，已经引发一次反右运动。</p>

<p>刘少奇被拉下来，连带整个国务院官僚系统被整肃，其体现结果就是文化大革命。</p>

<p>最后就一直斗到毛泽东死。</p>

<p>国家是需要有人管理的，毛泽东维护个人利益但是不傻，他有时候是清楚知道自己的理想主义与个人利益和国家发展有冲突，所以也会减速，但是后面明显收不住，收不住就干脆不收了。</p>

<p>行政运作就变成了国务院由周恩来来处理，维持一定程度的社会运作，政治上的事毛不断扶持一派拉扯一派互斗，林彪死后，毛基本开始维持内外朝。</p>

<p>也即四人帮、毛远新为主的“内朝”，意图扶持毛远新上位，“外朝”由华国锋、汪东兴等人维持，但毛泽东一死，华国锋这些人就反水，拿掉了毛泽东的嫡系。</p>

<p>跟着华国锋和汪东兴这些希望借毛的威望和模式继续搞下去，结果又被国务院的官僚逐渐挤兑出政治舞台，邓既是毛原本在建立政权和发展过程里的嫡系，但也有一定自己的独立性，并且在建政后的发展里和国务院走得近，却又跟四人帮这些不对付。</p>

<p>属于一个既用也好用，军政都有经验，背景相对靠得住的人，这也是邓小平几次下台还能被毛拉上来用以跟其他人平衡的原因。</p>

<p>但是毛泽东到最后其实是铁了心想彻底搞死邓了（政治生涯或物理上的），但江青来不及实施，毛泽东就死了，救了邓。</p>

<p>跟着就是邓陈等人逐渐获得话语权，胡赵在中央和地方发力，敲定改革开放，这就是改开现代史的部分了。</p>

<p>以上大体就是建政后主要政治运动，再到毛泽东派系完全覆灭的一个过程。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2019.4</strong> —–2023-03-02 15:30:25+08:00:</p>

<p>虽然说是被苏联绑定了，但归根结底问题还是毛的政治观念和立场问题</p>

<p>毛泽东是斯大林的好学生，他的政治取向是更愿意靠拢向苏联和斯大林的，一个社会主义国家，价值观和立场上肯定是更靠近苏联，在毛的视角看来，除了苏联也别无依靠，需要外部援助，苏联就是个很好的富哥。</p>

<p>斯大林的行为更接近于要求交投名状，中方则是看情况下菜碟，苏联干预他们就介入，苏联也的确需要中国作为稳定的盟友施加在亚洲的影响力，没有苏联在冷战下需要亚洲桥头堡的刚需，毛泽东也不会选择出兵，在东北利益交换反而是其次。</p>

<p>因为中共当时面临的是刚刚建立一个新政权，资源和管理经验严重不足，依赖外部帮助的时候，而毛泽东个人利益上也很看重输出意识形态与革命的身份。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2019.5</strong> —–2023-03-06 20:35:57+08:00:</p>

<p>对私营经济铁拳出击后，短期内掌握了大量的资源与经济权力，对外封闭时，这些资源让他么觉得自己又行了，对内呢，要有一个交代。</p>

<p>既然不跟外国人做生意了，就自己搞起发展计划来。</p>

<p>政党给自己定了每年应当实现的增长数字，达不到了，怎么办？</p>

<p>那就要开始拔苗助长了，吹风促进，过热冒进，希望毕其功于一役。</p>

<p>在基本意识形态和理想主义的作用下，出现了各种不切实际的大跃进目标。</p>

<p>当然哪怕不是现在积极实现，本身社会主义的政治理念也是存在的。</p>

<p>只不过大跃进本身，不完全是外部环境变化憋出来的，而是外部环境变化后一系列内部运动，加速催生了这种现象，以中共体制和毛这个人的存在，就算不对私营经济出手，大概率还是会有的。</p>

<p>早期大跃进的过于乐观，我觉得有这样一个演变过程，最初觉得外部封锁了，政策改变，对右派和私营经济出手，会不会有什么不好影响的问题（双百运动）</p>

<p>结果觉得好像不靠外面也能办事，是因为收缴生产资料和控制生产秩序后，大量资源的涌现让他们有了一种自信，浮夸风就是当时的体现，浮夸风的基础就是短期资源盈余，而生产效率被腰斩的问题还没体现。</p>

<p>等体现出来时，大锅饭就吃不起了，开始闹饥荒了。（早期公共食堂是确实有饭吃的）</p>

<p>如果中国是个小国，他们能从民间掠夺的资源未必够他们有信心基础展开浮夸风和跃进运动，转向也能更快，但中国当时几个亿人口，吃饭的嘴也多，但生产效率还很低，生产一被拦腰斩断，问题堆积的也更大。</p>

<p>毛泽东建政后主政的两个阶段，第一阶段完全倒向苏联，换取了有限的技术和资源，随后政治和经济上恶化了内部相对缓和的环境，被迫用激进手法快速推动社会适合他们管控，并且随后在缺乏治国经验和过度自信后，造成了更大规模的悲剧。</p>

<p>跟着毛泽东为了维护他一直以来的政治路线，必须持续对内发动政治运动。第二阶段则是在执政中后期，完全与苏联交恶且转向美国。</p>

<p>毛死前其实也意识到了国内状况必须改，但不愿意改，因为这涉及到他的个人政治立场和利益，一开始投靠苏联后带来的连锁反应，已经让他无法回头了，所以华国锋的洋跃进，就是在试图不否定毛路线前提下，进行对旧有体制的缝缝补补，直到彻底失败被边缘化。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2019.6</strong> —–2023-03-06 21:01:30+08:00:</p>

<p>可能性很小吧，华国锋他们是毛一死就立刻谋划处理四人帮，大概率是之前已经私下沟通过了。</p>

<p>四人帮这面不是完全没有反应，但按照已有资料来看，都没有华国锋等人快，可能党内有资料记录但没公开或者压根没被记录。</p>

<p>毛远新要不要被外放出去这件事就发生过争执，可能此时四人帮的警戒心还没到最高，十月份毛远新想起要调兵，还让民兵准备，尤其是上海的，结果叶剑英职权和威望更高，一下给覆盖了。</p>

<p>除非华国锋反应比他们慢，毛远新的军队威望和职务能覆盖叶剑英的命令。</p>

<p>或者四人帮集体跑到上海，还能让当地的官僚与军队服从命令，能跟北京形成对立局势，单纯靠北京方面，机会渺茫。</p>

<p>毛泽东晚年可能没预期到他一死，华国锋等人就先斗起他的嫡系，而且他对毛远新的安排也是偏慢的，他也应该没预期到自己恶化的这么快。</p>

<p>从时间上来看，毛泽东身体健康从1974年迅速恶化，然后开始对毛远新加速提拔，1975年基本上已经无法独立自理，76年按现在说法算半瘫痪了。</p>

<p>毛远新恰巧是75年结束在辽宁军队和党务系统的锻炼，被毛泽东拉回中央，他让毛远新代行很多扩大会议，应该是希望他把这群人的班底接过来，但显然不大可能。</p>

<p>如果毛泽东多活三五年，毛远新是可以在中央站稳脚跟的，但是第二年毛泽东就死了，叶剑英等人希望调毛远新外放离开北京，可能也是考虑毛远新的影响力，怕自己翻车，好在最后毛远新也没翻起风浪。</p>

<p>毛可能预期他死后，主要对四人帮和毛远新的接班压力，来自于邓在内的等国务院”保守派“，所以毛泽东死前最后研究的就是要不要彻底打倒邓小平。</p>

<p>最后他下决定是要彻底边缘化邓小平，毛远新一手抓，江青也很积极，结果就要落实了，毛泽东死了，无暇顾及。</p>

<p>没料到他安排在国务院和军队的”外朝“嫡系反水，也没提前安排好后事，挺像刘彻托孤霍光，但这个霍光等都不等，直接反手就废帝。</p>

<p>结果被陈云和邓小平等人给黄雀在后了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2019.7</strong> —–2023-03-08 01:35:48+08:00:</p>

<p>堡垒战术是常规军事思想的体现，受过军事训练的将领如果有需要肯定想得到，但非常依赖资源，五次围剿里，蒋介石开始侧重接手后，国民党实际都一直尝试该路线，战略进攻合围，战术寻求决战。</p>

<p>但是资源不足无法形成合围寻找主力快速决战，这个是经常被忽略的，国民党也不是德国顾问来了突然开窍。</p>

<p>因为兵力动员规模超过三十万后，仍然不足以进行分兵合围逼迫中共主力决战，反而被运动战穿插迂回消灭留守部队，第四次反围剿时，南丰等地已经开始进行就地固守，中共强攻也造成了不小损失。</p>

<p>德国顾问就职后，刚好蒋介石以塘沽协定抽出手来，开始大规模集中资源用于围剿。</p>

<p>林彪就指出了堡垒战术的不可持续性：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>有些负责同志把敌人在五次“围剿”中的堡垒政策看成了很机械的，以为敌人是在任何条件下都是三四百米一进、三五里一推的步步为营，这种观察是显然没有看到敌人在政治上财政上的困难，不允许它完全采用这种方法。</p>

  <p>敌人每推进一步，须做一步的堡垒，但每期堡垒至少需四日才能完成，它如完全用这个方法前进，它将要耗费若干年月的时间，若干数量的兵力，若干巨大的经费才能把我们苏区蚕食尽呢？</p>

  <p>同时我们的苏区虽一区域被其侵占而缩小了，而在其他地方我们的苏区仍可继续发展着。在事实上，敌人在过去、在现在，也没有完全采用三四百米一推的方法。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>谁想到蒋介石下了血本，大量资源集中进行战术防守战略逼近，蚕食中共控制的根据地，没有空间留给他们进行穿插，加上李德的战略误判，以及中共内部此时矛盾和斗争问题。</p>

<p>另外是否是德国顾问制定，也只是有相关说法，从实际角度来说，是蒋介石、柳维垣、戴岳等人一起开会制定的。</p>

<p>再有毛泽东等人的军事问题，博古侄子写的东西作为诸多参考物可以看，把主观性的评价当作绝对客观就不切实际了。</p>

<p>军事作战不是手里拿曾希圣和曹祥仁破译的密码就跟游戏开全图挂一样，要真那么简单毛泽东就能在红军内做大做强，就不用争路线了，政权核心实权人物的斗争都是要经过能力考研的，党内中高层干部接受和服从毛也是有原因的。</p>

<p>与毛立场对立的情况与舆论环境，评价毛的能力又跟墙内评价蒋介石一样，过度为了破神话和形象而压低甚至扁低，综合客观历史发展事实，都能发现有不对劲的地方。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2022.1</strong> —–2023-03-06 20:09:49+08:00:</p>

<p>因为实际刺激的是全球经济市场，而不单独是国内市场。</p>

<p>富人或者企业的持有者获得减税，最后还是要回归到降低生产与财富持有成本，他们因此会选择将市场与资产分布到全球范围内。</p>

<p>也就是说这些资金最后大概率流出了国内，可能在国外进行更好的生产来获取财富，然后反馈回国内，但是这样环节过多，就无法判断哪部分是政策本身带来的有效执行。</p>

<p>现代社会其实每个持有超量财富的人，注定根本不可能靠个人消费带动经济增长，因此每个这种巨富的个人或企业，他们实际都自己担当了一个投资节点，可以更好的促进产业发展，因为他们能承担更多风险在一些中长期内毫无收益，且耗费巨大的新兴产业。</p>

<p>产业发展离不开这种模式，我不同意有观点认为这部分人手上的钱是“一潭死水“，相反钱到了他们手里就不再是传统税收、市场环节里的等价媒介，而是一种定向投资的资源。</p>

<p>如果全都要依赖从这些巨富个体手中获取大量财富用于处理财政失衡，结果只会是融资、投资市场的停滞，投资者希望看到的是未来潜在盈利的市场，投资者也会自己承担损失，而不需要政府用税收承担。</p>

<p>法定税收是个非常严谨的领域，没有税率增长和扩张，很难合法从各个领域征税。</p>

<p>如果政府要不断承担一个主动性很高的积极介入角色，不可能靠无限加税给全社会来处理，尤其是政府无法有效进行财富分配时，单独对中产和富裕阶层征税，既达不到足够的税收量，也可能导致他们作为”投资节点“的活跃度下降。</p>

<p>这也是为什么MMT理论有市场的原因，但MMT不能单独的对应整个现代政府财政发展的模式，还需要多种方案复合才行，因为MMT某种意义上来说一定会崩，可是只要经济不断发展，确保未来有税收就可以了，那么税收的增长基础在哪？</p>

<p>过去是以经济发展作为税收的增长基本盘，但慢慢的科技摸到极限，就要看人口规模和结构，但发达国家几乎没有不面临人口增长下降的情况，也就是说个体生产对经济的影响是越来越少的，自己国家内没有那么多未发达人口可以进行转化。</p>

<p>除非是对外拓展市场，然后提高本国劳动待遇，在产生消费的同时进行征税，确保税收基础跟得上债务利息。</p>

<p>这样问题就回归到一个基本问题上了，这些财政措施，都要涉及到一个企业对外的环节部分，政府是没法进行有效税收，加税给企业他们会外流，不加税全球化下国内必然不可能有对应的劳动岗位。</p>

<p>那么反过来想，全球化其实反而能通过降低生产成本，让物价廉价，然后反过来输出到国内，降低生活必需品的刚性开支，而通过全球化发展，其他国家慢慢形成有消费能力的阶级群体，本国生产的产品就又多了一个市场，从而确保了经济增长。</p>

<p>因此开拓外部市场就有必要性，但是光这样也不行，还要依靠基础科技的增长来带动经济活动产能上限的增长。</p>

<p>经济活动总产值，依赖基础科技带来的生产力X人口基数（与对应结构），这两个铁壁的增速，前者依赖富裕阶层的投资和企业实用化，后者依赖移民，单纯靠内源性的传统模式已经不可能有积极增长，外源性的开拓除了前两者外，就是要靠全球化推动其他市场的发展，增加本地企业的市场需求，以及在发展阶段获得廉价的产品。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-02-20~2023-02-26的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-26/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-02-20~2023-02-26的言论" /><published>2023-02-26T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-26T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-26/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-26/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>2011.1</strong> —–2023-02-21 19:25:40+08:00:</p>

<p>超级大国是一个世界的耦合器，承担超级大国意味着要用极高的开销比例去在全球范围内承担军事、政策的费用，并不意味着更好。</p>

<p>因为美国国内也有意识到，如果减少对外开支，美国的市场与经济可以反过来促进国内更多公共政策的进步，美国3.3亿人口，在全球开销已经到了非常夸张的地步，承受大量无可避免的政治冲突，进而引发的恐怖袭击。</p>

<p>任何一个国家其实有脑子，都应该避免去成为一个超级大国，因为一旦意识形态完全趋同，就很难有大规模开战的风险，军队除了必要部分外，比起外在的军事冲突，更应该关注国民的福祉与社会发展前景。</p>

<p>政府存在的目的是更好管理社会，让授权者使用集体资源与利益的让渡，来达成社会进步、公平，而不是跟游戏里一样的填色游戏。</p>

<p>通过商业行为带来的文化传播是当下和未来的主流，越发达的社会与商业，越能输出价值观与文化，当不需要过量军队的意识形态联盟天然达成后，意识形态本身就不是最重要的了。</p>

<p>美国是一个多民族的移民国家，这是许多单一民族或者缺乏移民文化的国家难以比拟的，这样一个复杂的大熔炉，可以作为社会与意识形态演化的前沿阵地，而社会前沿除了先进，也往往伴随大量冲突和矛盾。</p>

<p>因为经济、意识形态的最终趋同，我们只需要走在他们后面，他们踩石头，我们走稳路，确保十几亿人的生活质量，利用其他更先发达的国家经验来降低改革成本，是最有利于本国的方向。</p>

<p>其他任何国家，都没有复杂民族社会背景与体量，可以说美国在这方面是第一个“现代国家”，诞生于反威权与互相妥协，基于先验的天然理性与后验的反馈，而世界上绝大部分历史悠久的国家，都是通过后验不断修正而来，民族成分也往往倾向单一。</p>

<p>美国刚好处于一个人口不上不下的位置，没有太大以至于对内都无法维持（印度、中国），也不会太小体量不足维持庞大市场和全球对外维持秩序的军力（日本与其他五常）。</p>

<p>作为人类社会演化的最前沿试验场，美国是非常合适的对象，能看到演化过程里很赤裸裸粗糙的一面，也能看到先进性与发达性，并不像较小型的发达国家那样精而美，也无单一民族发达国家的文化保留。</p>

<p>如果日本被移民人口对冲掉失去原来的社会面貌，反而对很多人来讲可能是一种损失，庞大的主体人口也会引起反弹，而美国本身就是移民国家，全世界没有比这里更适合进行全球人口的融合了。</p>

<p>打破成为超级大国=好的思维，我觉得可能还需要一定时间，一旦人们意识到有限的政府财政应该覆盖在国内，而不是负债投入到国外浪费掉（靠美军维持美元和美国经济这种说法不实不要再说了，懒得吐槽了），很快就会对各种财政预算进行审核，并且要求更多落实在公民身上。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2011.2</strong> —–2023-02-23 05:12:14+08:00:</p>

<p>全世界大部分国家如果从有没有其他民族来定义多民族国家，那许多国家都是多民族。</p>

<p>而法国、俄罗斯、中国的多民族与美国的多民族社会是完全不同的概念，前者主体民族强势，且其他民族差异相对小，同化率高，少数民族更缺乏文化影响力。</p>

<p>以我国为例，少数民族基本都被汉化，只作为习俗而不是一种有明确社会影响力的族裔群体存在，其中少数没有被高度汉化的，如疆藏地区民众，也是基于地理隔绝因素，汉化程度相对较低，但汉文化也有相当程度流行。</p>

<p>美国即便是白人族群内，也分为多国家出身，意大利裔、德裔、爱尔兰裔出身都是比较明显的，其中意大利与爱尔兰裔出身的歧视，一直到二战后才逐渐消失，意大利裔的劳动收入在早期连黑人都不如。</p>

<p>也就是一直到战后，伴随民权运动的兴起，黑人解放运动下才衬托了白人新教徒作为一个社会主体，但现在反过来看，其实是忽略了白人之间内部矛盾。</p>

<p>甚至有洋基佬和南方人的对立，这显然不是白种新教徒们的内部矛盾，而是两个不同文化群体与族裔之间的冲突，只不过到后期淡化了出身，更多以在地文化的形式凸显出来，而天主教与新教和出身地的矛盾，这些都往往被人一笔带过，变成了因为他们是白人，所以他们是一个集体，就跟白人粗糙地看中日韩一样。</p>

<p>因此从根源上就很难说美国有一个绝对的主体民族，因为白人在族裔、文化、语言、宗教上的差异，通常也不小，只是他们更早开始融合，而现代人没大多数没经历过当时的歧视和地域冲突。</p>

<p>到了现代，黑人族群和墨西哥裔崛起已经成为事实，还有印度裔、亚裔也开始有更大的影响，如果WASP代表的美国传统保守群体，掌握社会主流，就无法解释当代美国政治正确和多元化的去全面崛起，某方面最原教旨主义的大概就是Amish了，但即便如此，甚至Amish里也分出了现代派和保守派，这一点也体现在语言的选用上。</p>

<p>WASP早期引用所指的人群，他们的后代里的相当部分人，实际上也是美国现代多元化的白人支持者，尤其是一些家里有钱又受影响的反威权主义者，嬉皮士晕动就有不少人来自这样出身的传统家庭，到了现代各类平权运动的参与者，构成也依然非常相似。</p>

<p>美国社会的单纯是超脱了族裔与文化以在地利益划分的单纯，复杂的是作为文化熔炉，所能体现出来的理性对立性，不能简单的地方偏要复杂化，复杂的地方一笔带过，这样有助于更好的去理解美国的存在，来映射出不同时期的经验，去处理国内问题。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2011.3</strong> —–2023-02-23 15:14:06+08:00:</p>

<p>欧裔白人是个先发群体，在这个群体当中还有大量的内部矛盾与歧视，只不过他们更早完成内部融合，再加上来自其他族裔的对比，让内部矛盾与区别显得没那么凸出而被淡化忽视了。</p>

<p>比如前面提到的意大利裔与爱尔兰裔，其中新教徒与天主教徒还有很大的区别，包括社区上的，早期这些族裔之间甚至不通婚或使用同一种语言，南北方人的矛盾甚至延续到今天，后来在南方保守主义与经济发达地区的进步主义对比下，左右派的价值观矛盾在战后更是凸显。</p>

<p>作为一个移民国家，以混血人口比例来计算文化熔炉与否并不严谨。</p>

<p>美国不断涌入的外来人口是不会减少的，所以总会显得美国有一部分族裔没有融入其中，而隔阂之大的族群往往需要数代人才会从文化层面同化，黑人社区近三十年的融入，如果回头看六十年代或之前，他们的街头文化与边缘身份能登堂入室成为主流是很让人想不到的一件事。</p>

<p>反而白人族裔生育数量下降，导致这些社会划分不能拿民权运动前后的观点一概而论，图方便去划线就跟美国对中日韩甚至越南在内的单调理解一样，尤其是当代被讽刺的政治正确，就是其他族群多元文化的体现，这是其他人口较少或移民相对较少的国家与社会没有的一个特点。</p>

<p>这种情况我思考过为什么，觉得是这个人进入他们视线才开始关注政治或者高层人士变动，也可以理解为认知上在当时仍然有普遍的分歧，相当多数人存有希望和改良主义心态。（但是考虑到胡温时期的状况，有也是正常的）</p>

<p>现在大抵是完成政治生态的演化，大家都站好队了，不期望靠中共内部有什么改变来完成变革，就等该来的来了。</p>

<p>政治生态演化，从过去的键政过瘾，到现在的看他楼塌就添砖加瓦盖坟，再到有余地动拳头。</p>

<p>我觉得这种认知不止是反贼有，粉红也有了，大家都知道政治生态演化基本到末期，剩下的就是时间问题，中共财政还能支撑一些年头，维持表面的体面和稳定，是没斗起来的主要原因，换做早十几年，是很难想象到的（就好比2015年我已经在说经济危机问题，当时国内主流社区大部分人其实都不愿意相信）</p>

<p>假设普京没有把土地问题抬得太高，仍然还有挽回余地，但是后来的政治操作直接让他很难有退路，这一点实际是绑死了中共，要么当下切割，要么持续投入押注，否则一旦普京失势，对俄罗斯的政治赌注全都会变成负资产，成为对中共未来的一个投影，更会让人心惶惶。</p>

<p>俄罗斯目前僵持，作为一个公开话题被允许讨论，那俄罗斯战败或者普京这样的政治强人失势，哪怕只是吃瘪，国内又会投影到谁身上，不言而喻。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2013.2</strong> —–2023-02-23 05:24:34+08:00:</p>

<p>普京把矛盾和政治冲突升级到无路可退的做法，未必是吃死中国的决定，因为俄罗斯内部高层对这一系列错误操作都没有进行内部意见征求。</p>

<p>中方虽然在靠拢，但仍然以反对战争的口吻留了退路，习梭哈更多是要避免政治身份上的投射，俄罗斯就算讨不到好处，普京要是不下台，战略盟友也依然存在，但是普京的政治威望被动摇，这种只存在于人心的冲击，在中国却是人人都在看着的。</p>

<p>假设普京吃瘪结束战争，或者乌克兰边境长期糜烂，出于对自身政权、个人政治威望的考虑，习近平的角度都会想办法帮助普京，但这未必是普京考虑到的，也就是说普京不大可能像墨索里尼知道意大利战败会给纳粹德国与希特勒，带来同意识形态政权与领袖战败一样的冲击，更多是为了自己，而习近平理论上有这种考虑。</p>

<p>理论上没有，中共现在什么都抓的特别严，一旦崩了，社会很快就会进入一个无秩序的权力、财政双真空阶段。</p>

<p>其实按省来算，不符合现在的财政分配模式，因为一个富省，可能大多数地方都是入不敷出，只有一两个核心城市有较高的稳定收入，最典型就是广东。</p>

<p>平时是靠社会稳定带来的政治权威，以及财政优势实施行政压制，来让户籍制度的剪刀差得以保证，这两点一旦消失，不说房价暴跌的问题，知识型人口大概率是会想办法外迁，部分基层劳动人口会返乡迁出，但会有更多人口短期内迁入。</p>

<p>到时候原来维持各地养老金与医保资金的剪刀差制度，会因为没有行政效力即时瓦解。</p>

<p>没有户籍限制，人口会有大量的流动，包括迁入迁出。</p>

<p>如果只是这样还好办，有钱还能缓冲一下，但中共基本把未来潜在已知的一切财政工具空间全部用的七七八八，而且大概率临下台前还要超负荷使用，比如土地财政、债务、货币政策等渠道。</p>

<p>所以大概率中共倒台后，或者说他们不尽快在浪费掉未来所有财政潜力前倒台，大概率是用未来财政储备，死撑着不下台，下台了耗尽全国过去和未来前后数十年的财政空间。</p>

<p>扔下一个历史上前所未有的烂摊子，然后六十年代到三十年代出生的人，大概率一辈子都要扔里面。</p>

<p>尤其是九十年代到二十年代出生的人，刚好出于一个需要养老和医保资金的时候。</p>

<p>其实即便是这样了，缓个几十年也是可以恢复的，但就像我上面说的，至少两三代人的一辈子都要处于一个极度痛苦的环境，应该没人想持续几十年公共服务几乎无增长吧？</p>

<p>总体来讲我们一定要避免“双真空”同时出现，但更应该避免财政真空，这个真空期与债务问题，配合不好会把改革开放几十年来的发展都吐出来。</p>

<p>日本完成了转型，才能维持生活水平，中国没完成转型原地遇到一样的结构性危机，到时候印度越南一旦追上来，面临的竞争、收入水平停滞、通胀会比预期更夸张，比起日本的停滞，更可能出现倒退。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2015.1</strong> —–2023-02-21 18:43:27+08:00:</p>

<p>教育问题大体的一些问题。</p>

<p>比如学位通胀，但是产业上又掐自己脖子，导致卷来卷去进入更高层的产业无望，这种高学历就职压力进而向下压迫就业市场，无论是高学历还是低学历的都非常痛苦。</p>

<p>九十年代到两千年初，大学生已经能找到不错的工作，现在研究生才行，然后慢慢还要名校才能达到近似待遇。</p>

<p>就直接导致高学历低收入待遇，低学历连人都不算，既无中基层的职业教育体系，也缺乏高层产业升级吸收过量高等教育人才的问题，劳动待遇又给不上去，基层黑中介处理，中高层直接996。</p>

<p>所以解决这种问题，一个是要解决无锚扩招的政策，二是要解决产业升级，三是横向建设职业教育体系。</p>

<p>产业升级我们都知道，很多时候政府掐脖子问题就来了，对中小民企扶持力度不够，还跟垄断企业眉来眼去，在当下执政党手中，根本不存在彻底放开对企业限制，因为其政治生态本身就无法适应一个生产力水平更高的社会结构，他们只想发展好控制，以及能被控制的产业，控制不了就宁可压着不管也不会去碰，偏要抓紧这方面的话语权，比如版号。</p>

<p>无锚扩招现象其实是最好解决的，你不能说停下扩招不让人读书，可是那么多人读书，不能走两个极端，也就是说不能要么基层一点书都读不了去当螺丝，也不能只有往死卷研究生和名校来获得有限的大厂就业机会，要柠檬化，不能沙漏化。</p>

<p>那中间的关键点在哪？</p>

<p>建立一个完整的职业教育体系啊，这样就可以疏导高等教育的压力，同时把中基层拉跨的学历-出路比例拽起来，形成一个健全的认证体系。</p>

<p>现在国内职高就是毫无卵用的混日子，而这东西要执行，靠中央只能给一个全国性统一的框架，实际执行要靠地方自己出人出政策出财政，因为人培育好了，也大概了是支援当地劳动市场，不会有高等教育人才那么高的流动性。</p>

<p>可到这里问题又出现在哪？地方政府出钱是不可能的了，出政策，中央政府能答应吗？所以说就是把末端微细血管的事，都要收集起来管，结果还管不好。</p>

<p>对蓝领阶层的教育和认证体系建设，是非常重要的一件事，因为中国如果转型为一个发达国家，十几亿人口必然有大量的人是从农民转型为城市蓝领阶层，没有一种流通性强，对接便捷的体系，根本就无从谈起。</p>

<p>国内基本搞得好像要么是读大学，还要去考研，要么就是毫无出路的一生，你参考现在的劳动待遇，基层劳动者那算人吗？那就是会说话的农具和工具。</p>

<p>现在不是社会经济的发展上升期，各方面机会都在逐渐封闭，而内需消费社会还未建成，不能产生就业与经济需求去供养大量的蓝领阶层，也无法有效发挥他们的消费能力。</p>

<p>我不去谈对共产党历史上一切的政治和原则性问题，只谈现在，把国家管理到这种程度，烂成这个样，还是请他们让贤吧，这么搞下去，是未来几代人都要遭殃。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2018.1</strong> —–2023-02-25 19:58:48+08:00:</p>

<p>如果消息属实，那其实就是一个内部维稳的终端。</p>

<p>过去这些部门互相串联都很难，甚至地方跟地方都不互通，公安部门想要其他数据，不是什么说调用立刻就有，在内部联网下也要走很多路线，这方面晶哥冲业绩其实许多人被请喝茶都谈过了，能看出他们工作的逻辑大体是什么样的一个轮廓，也有例子是地方上被盯了，到出入环节官方信息没跟上，让人跑掉了的例子。</p>

<p>总体来讲，通过去年年底社会运动，能看出来他们维稳系统比想的要效率低且职权分散，因此有必要建立一个终端系统可以高效率串联，当然就算没有，也会改革出来，毕竟维稳需求升级是大趋势，但社会运动显然刺激到了他们的求生欲。</p>

<p>应该会革除过去地方维稳各自为政，地方非公安部门调用数据繁琐的问题。国安如果单独做这方面工作，职能扩散的就有些不必要显得太正式，覆盖全国偏民生项的工作，估计会交给这个部分，提高点对点维稳的效率（如果连户籍方向和民政部门的工作都要过问的话，吃喝拉撒估计都要精确打击了），顺便再加强一下对基层的管控能力，特别是疫情封控过后。</p>

<p>另外把这种维稳机构从国务院的政府体系剥离，直接归于党务，其实是很危险的做法，因为过去中共执政，基本还是需要靠政府这个组织架构去执行的，搭配党委来建立一个平行的垂直体系。</p>

<p>现在绕开了，不止是政府部门的数据直接被另一个党组织抽调与上缴，党员在内也要受该制度监视，而该部门行为逻辑却不受政府工作条例约束，只有党务原则，没有政府和公共法理原则，出问题了很难通过该体系去往更上册反馈。</p>

<p>假设这个东西真的存在且落实，而且还跟历史上各类臭名昭著的“内务部门”有一样的职能，那真是离政权完蛋不远，这个东西一旦铺开了，最后没有不加速灭亡的。</p>

<p>因为一你要花很多钱去建立一个新体系，然后扩充大量人手，以此绕开政府去更高效率的精准维稳与迅速反应，但是最后执行还是地方，就算你搞一个毕业高材生组件的维稳巡回小组，跟秦始皇一样到处巡游，就算弄一千多人全国按星期去处理地方数据，然后分拣哪些群情事件和政治问题人士。</p>

<p>始终会有一个效率极限在，而社会管控靠的是寒蝉效应，否则根本没有资源点对点十几亿人口，有那么几个零头产生维稳压力，没几万人都分拣不出来，最后还要靠地方执行，地方执行还是需要钱的，越弄这些毫无生产力需求的部门，资金消耗就越快。</p>

<p>靠这种部门长期精准抓维稳，原来的地方维稳体系就会怠惰松懈，等中央财政也绷不住了，当众脱出，恐怕执政生涯就要结束了罢。</p>

<p>所以我想他们也清楚这点，会在近一两年内抓一些人，但首要是恢复经济，经济有点起色了，政府有底气说话了，他们才敢宣示政治上的控制权，抓典型来警告全国不许有反心继续老实服从，可能同步进行警告之余，强推一些利己但侵害社会整体利益的改革。</p>

<p>所以这是好事，等不及版本更新了。</p>

<p>目前实质性的方面还没太大进展，视乎乌克兰战争如何结束，如果按照乌克兰战争早期情况，各国可能会先观望台湾是否自己能挡住第一波攻击，有价值防御下去才会持续介入。</p>

<p>台湾现在危机感比前两年有提高，但是还不够高，所以要看未来几年他们岛内对外危机的改革提升状况，25-27年刚好是一个大陆财政和对内政治生态过渡的窗口期，过了这个节点可能就会进一步恶化。</p>

<p>不过在我看来，如果台湾自己守不住，欧洲甚至未必会参与制裁，美国介入意愿还不算十分明朗，台湾很多人还不把大陆入侵的潜在可能性提高当回事，25年反应如果还是这么松懈，状况会很不乐观，台湾社会很多人还对中共政权的认知停留在江胡到习近平早期。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2018.4</strong> —–2023-03-01 16:33:35+08:00:</p>

<p>江胡时期，威权收缩存在，但不明显，八十年代的自由化惯性强，胡温是胡赵一代人培育出来的学生，胡政治保守但作风相对传统保守派宽容，温在政治上更开明进步。</p>

<p>江是投机主义者，并无既定价值观层面对自由化的敌对立场，且受教育水平高，对自由化产物有一定接纳性。</p>

<p>虽然六四后政党对建立威权社会一直在推进，但经济发展也意味着民权与企业的经济权力扩张，加上人事背景，延缓了威权社会的成立。</p>

<p>到习近平世代，意味着保守派试图培育红二三代接班的路线完成，技术官僚相对分散掌握权力的时代过去。</p>

<p>习近平早期上台时，因为处于过渡期与权力斗争白热化阶段，无暇顾及其他方面，社会的管控最松散，既无胡温时期的微微收缩，也无后来也即今天的高度管控。</p>

<p>这种相对宽和的社会风气与政府执政风格，配合财政与经济发展的上升期，政权没有明显的生存危机，不依赖也没有社会基础实行极端政策。</p>

<p>而大陆的集权状况，从六四后到胡温时代对台湾人都是一贯印象，这种集权的负面印象，与经济发展带来的温和作风，会给台湾人一种习近平的集权与过去无异，而不在大陆生活又无法体会到大陆社会生态的细微渐变的误判。</p>

<p>因此容易造成这种错觉，在台湾人看来，过去大陆的中共就是这么蛮不讲理和专制，现在习近平上台顶多是多了一些新闻。</p>

<p>但实际情况是，习近平的上台与集权，对整个中国的社会与政治、经济生态都有很大的影响，并且也与过去时代不同，即便习近平个人不愿意，但客观上大陆的经济恶化，政府的财政安全性渐渐消失，为了延续自身政权生存，有可能做任何事来苟延残喘。</p>

<p>觉得胡温时代与习近平时代区别不大，没有意识到政权本质从一定程度上的治理、发展，彻底变成了维系统治，就会错过捕捉危机征兆细节的机会。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2018.5</strong> —–2023-03-02 10:02:58+08:00:</p>

<p>江的政治投机者身份，与个人行为上的无关，而江也是有一定派系背景倾向的，他本身就是李先念陈云等保入中央的代理人，只是政治上邓陈自由化处理没分歧，所以放了江泽民的缺。</p>

<p>邓南巡之前，江一直在放任党内左派在舆论上公开攻击改革开放，这些是他作为党总书记的直接管辖领域，以至于后来引出邓让朱镕基等以皇甫平的名义的舆论战，江的同期总理李鹏还到上海公开批评改革相关事宜，到最后甚至逼到邓南巡，要靠地方长官去给北京传话，但在赵紫阳时期，他却也知道如何落实地方工作，顺着中央意思走。</p>

<p>因为本来江是没有可能入主中央的，所以在六四上位前，从大众观点去看他，就只是一个圆滑懂人情世故，有一定保守派立场但相对开明的技术官僚，到退休年纪准备去教书，一下子成为全国领导人，再到九七年后能牵制他的元老大部分去世。</p>

<p>所以可以说江的闷声发大财，是对这些年收益的总结，看江的政策，大部分都是延续胡赵时期对邓经济改革有利的，六四后对保守派政治制度有利的工作，实际上就是萧规曹随，个人并无长远的具体大方向，因为他本来已经打算退休了。</p>

<p>他自己不多管经济，有事都交给相对职务的人处理，不像后来习近平一样什么都要干涉亲自领导，技术官僚的建制化就体现在这。</p>

<p>无论往前的胡赵、邓陈，还是同期的李瑞环、朱镕基、李鹏、乔石等等，再到后面的胡温，其实都是夹着他往前走，不走不行，包括许多人认为江时代相对开放开明，除了江本身干预失败后，个人对这些指标要求没习近平高，导致有一种反差，再有就是延续了胡赵时期的自由化风气，这一点是很多开放开明的好感来源。</p>

<p>六四后陈云李先念作为他最大的靠山，一度试图通过江去干预改革开放，最后引发了党内“姓资姓社”。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ForeignAffairsMag在2023-02-20~2023-02-26的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-24/ForeignAffairsMag/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ForeignAffairsMag在2023-02-20~2023-02-26的言论" /><published>2023-02-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-24/ForeignAffairsMag</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-24/ForeignAffairsMag/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p><strong>From Emma Ashford:</strong> At the Munich Security Conference in February 2022, mere days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s newly minted foreign minister, argued that Europe faced a stark choice between “Helsinki or Yalta.” To one side was the 1975 conference in Finland, where 35 countries signed an agreement that recognized Europe’s post–World War II boundaries as final and called for the promotion of international cooperation and human rights; to the other was the 1945 summit in Crimea, where Western leaders betrayed the countries of eastern Europe by granting Stalin free rein in the region. The choice, Baerbock said, was “between a system of shared responsibility for security and peace’’ or “a system of power rivalry and spheres of influence.” By March, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, was claiming that the West had made the right decision in refusing to discuss the issues of NATO enlargement or of Ukrainian neutrality. “Putin is trying to turn back the clock to another era—an era of brutal use of force, of power politics, of spheres of influence, and internal repression,” she argued. “I am confident he will fail.”</p>

<p>One year into the war, this view—that spheres of influence are a thing of the past—is more widely held than ever. The first major war on European soil since World War II is seen by many American and European foreign policy elites, paradoxically, not as a sign that the realities of rivalry and international power politics are back, but rather that Western values and security cooperation can triumph over them. For many commentators in the United States, U.S. President Joe Biden’s response to the war has been his biggest foreign policy triumph and a clear sign that U.S. foreign policy is on the right track. Indeed, the National Security Strategy that the White House released in October all but took a victory lap, noting, “We are leading a united, principled, and resolute response to Russia’s invasion and we have rallied the world to support the Ukrainian people as they bravely defend their country.”</p>

<p>Take a step back from the triumphalism, however, and that picture is less clear. The war in Ukraine is—if not precisely a deterrence failure for the United States—then at least a clear failure of U.S. policy decisions over the last few decades to maintain peace in Europe. It is certainly true that the war has shown the West’s willingness to confront the return of power politics. But it has also shown the practical limitations of that strategy. The last year has been not a refutation of a world of rivalry, great-power competition, or spheres of influence, as some have described it, but rather a demonstration of what all these look like in practice. It proves that the United States cannot always deter a resolute revisionist state without bearing unacceptably high costs and risks.</p>

<p>This misdiagnosis matters: if policymakers view the war in Ukraine as a triumph of U.S. policy, they will be more likely to make similar mistakes elsewhere. And as the United States enters a period of growing contestation over the borders of the Western sphere of influence, and how it will interact with those of Russia and China, learning the correct lessons from Ukraine could not be more urgent.</p>

<p><strong>From Fintan O’Toole:</strong> Anxiety about the future of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland is not new. It goes back to the beginning of the story. Yet for many British citizens, the death of Queen Elizabeth II has given a sharp new edge to these old apprehensions. The stability she embodied for so long has been, as Shakespeare might have put it, interred with her bones. Liz Truss, the prime minister whom the queen swore in two days before she died, plunged the United Kingdom almost immediately into a fiscal crisis and was gone just weeks later. Since then, the country has faced soaring energy prices, widespread strikes, and what will likely be the worst economic contraction in decades. Having abandoned Europe, the British government now finds itself not only less influential in the world but also increasingly at odds with Scotland and Northern Ireland, where large majorities voted to stay in the EU. And the monarchy, once an imposing symbol of British influence and British identity, is now the breeding ground for lurid tabloid tales of petty fratricidal wars and princes mired in scandal and enmity.</p>

<p>Of course, the United Kingdom has endured existential crises before. Formally inaugurated in 1707, when Scotland dissolved its own parliament and joined with England and Wales, the kingdom has grown and shrunk over the centuries, with the addition of all of Ireland in 1801 and the loss of most of it in 1922. Yet this peculiar multinational state persists. The first modern book on the topic of dissolution—The Breakup of Britain, by the brilliant Scottish socialist intellectual Tom Nairn—was published in 1977. Nairn asserted with absolute confidence, “There is no doubt that the old British state is going down.” Nearly a half century later, it is still afloat.</p>

<p>Although Nairn’s dire prognosis may have been premature, it could nonetheless have been quite prescient. He described the end of the United Kingdom as “a slow foundering rather than the Titanic-type disaster so often predicted”—a useful metaphor for the way the good ship Britannia now seems to be holed below the waterline. Scottish politics are now dominated by the Scottish National Party (SNP), for which leaving the kingdom is a defining mission. For the first time, Northern Ireland has lost the Protestant majority that for more than a century has formed the backbone of its union with Britain; demography alone suggests that its population will, over the coming decades, be ever more inclined toward unification with the Republic of Ireland. Even Wales, which England annexed as far back as 1284, has become increasingly distinct from it. In December, the interim report of the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales, established by the devolved government in Cardiff, found that current political arrangements with London are not sustainable. The commission pointed to more radical options, including the possibility of Wales becoming a fully independent country.</p>

<p>Most intriguing, as popular support for Brexit revealed, English voters themselves are increasingly asserting an English nationalism that was previously buried under British and imperial identities. These multiplying challenges leave the United Kingdom unsure about not just its place in the international order but also whether it can continue to be regarded as a single place. A polity that once shaped the world may no longer be able to hold its own shape.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2023-02-20~2023-02-26的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-23/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2023-02-20~2023-02-26的言论" /><published>2023-02-23T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-23/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-23/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1124.1</strong> —–2023-02-23 21:05:57+08:00:</p>

<p>I am going to have to confess from the get-go that my answer will be one that is incomplete, and necessarily so because of the nature of the source material. Simply put, <em>publicly</em> expressing any sort of wistful nostalgia for the Heavenly Kingdom, in any part of China, was unlikely to be beneficial to one’s health given the Qing’s rather understandable jumpiness around rebel remnants. The apparent resultant lack of any significant pro-Taiping sentiment thus needs to be weighed in relation to the sensibility of holding such sentiments: were people not expressing it because they <em>wouldn’t</em>, i.e. the Taiping were seen as having been a pretty bad thing overall; or were they not expressing it because they <em>couldn’t</em>, i.e. you didn’t want to be branded as treasonous? There is also a certain consideration that needs to be taken of regional variation: there is a tendency in the historiography on late imperial China to effectively treat the Lower Yangtze region, or even the Jiangnan more narrowly, as representative of the whole of China. There have of course been attempts to rectify this, but studies of cultural memory around the Taiping have still largely focussed on cultural production in the Jiangnan, which, to be fair, was the most persistently devastated region, as opposed to the Kingdom’s region of origin in the deep south. Those are the disclaimers to get out of the way.</p>

<p>For most Jiangnan literati elites, there was no love lost for the Taiping, who, in their various memoirs and jottings, represented a force of indiscriminate destruction and primal chaos. There was, in short, no particular reason for them to see the Taiping as particularly virtuous, or their return as desirable. Many of these memoirs were written by people who had suffered losses in the family because of, or merely coincidentally during the uprising, and those losses became indelibly associated with the broader period. The memoirist Xu Feng’en recounted that he had been unable to bury his mother properly after she died of illness in 1853 and so placed her coffin in a temporary burial chamber; the Taiping broke into it in 1863 and attempted to break down the coffin for firewood, but were stopped just short when news arrived that Qing forces had broken into the town, and they retreated. Zhang Guanglie, a child at the time of the war, went on to write the <em>Record of 1861</em>, a collection of texts all revolving around the death of his mother at Taiping hands in 1861. He, too, had no reason for particular affection towards the Taiping cause.</p>

<p>Even some who had at one stage supported the Taiping found little cause for praise of them afterward, though here is where we must account for certain political circumstances. Wang Tao absconded from Shanghai to Hong Kong in October 1862, having written a letter advising the Taiping to make common cause with the Western powers against the Manchus and thus ending up on the wrong side of the law within Qing territory. Yet his retrospective writings on the Taiping are decidedly uncharitable, or at least, he has nothing overtly positive to say. Yung Wing, who briefly served in an advisory capacity at the Taiping capital in 1859, similarly had little regard for them in retrospect. These two cases are interesting, however, because their authors had, by that stage, quite overtly switched political allegiances. Yung Wing became an informal member of the Qing general Zeng Guofan’s staff in 1863; Wang Tao later gained the patronage of Li Hongzhang, who successfully petitioned for his pardon in 1884. These two men may not necessarily have been pro-Qing as such; if anything, what this may reflect is a switch from one ethnocentric agenda to another, supporting the Han subversion of Manchu power from within the Qing state, rather than violent revolution from without. Nevertheless, their status also likely made any kind of complimentary discussion of the Taiping distinctly taboo, and it would be premature to declare that they had absolutely, unequivocally dropped any kind of privately-held association or sympathies.</p>

<p>The Qing state had taken a keen interest in public commemoration, but there was always somewhat of a tension between the state-directed commemorative agenda, which emphasised the eventual but costly Qing triumph over the rebellion, and the more directly personal and local reckoning with loss that individuals and communities engaged in. Some, for instance, found more solace in private gardens than in state-established ‘loyalty shrines’. Indeed, one provincial governor in 1874 complained that the Manifest Loyalty Shrine at Jinyazhuang was being misused in all sorts of ways: as a venue for birthday parties, operatic performances, and gambling; as a quarantine centre, a morgue, a rubbish dump, even a fishing spot. But to assert that the Qing state did not still affect commemorative practices would be mistaken: in Yangzhou, for instance, the Liangjiang Bureau to Gather and Investigate the Loyal and Righteous at least nominally set the agenda for how commemorations were to be decided upon and enacted in public, even if there remained considerable latitude for private commemorative acts in parallel.</p>

<p>Theatre, while aimed at a popular audience, still involved elite patronage, and so it, too, does not reveal a latent pro-Taiping sentiment in post-Taiping China. What we can see, however, is a certain degree of either censorship or self-censorship emerging in the postwar years in terms of how the Taiping were potrayed. The dramatist Yu Zhi, for instance, was just one of many playwrights who wrote plays that ultimately condemned the Taiping and yearned for – or, in the postwar period, celebrated – the return of social and moral order, though as Rania Huntington notes, Yu Zhi in particular was stylistically distinct from most of his contemporaries in taking a moralistic rather than sentimental approach. The result of this, though, is that the Taiping in Yu Zhi’s plays are not necessarily active agents of evil. Instead, some of Yu Zhi’s Taiping plays portray them in fact as ‘both the instrument of moral justice and the subjects of karmic judgment, in turn’, to quote Huntington. In his wartime oeuvre, the Taiping were ultimately evil, but Yu Zhi sympathised with those who saw them as righteous and were drawn to their cause; his aim was to return them to the correct path represented by Confucian orthodoxy. However, in his postwar Taiping play, the <em>Yinyang yu</em>, the focus is very much on the total condemnation of the rebel cause, and the depiction of followers not as somewhat unwitting dupes, but as either already depraved, or drawn into the movement by drugs and dark magics.</p>

<p>But all of these are functionally elite statements. The extent to which there was a more pro-Taiping grassroots school of thought remains, for the moment, largely unknown to us. What we <em>do</em> know is that there must have been a counter-narrative, at the very least in Guangdong. Sun Yat-Sen is the case in point here: he openly admired the Taiping’s ideals, even if he did have criticisms of some of their political and strategic failures. Such open admiration, albeit largely expressed after his departure from China, would only have been possible if there was indeed an underground, pro-Taiping narrative, at least among Sun’s Hakka community in Guangdong. Moreover, Sun’s memoirs are often contradictory, but one version would have it that his father had in fact been a Taiping convert, and that Sun was therefore born into a family of underground Taiping adherents. Huge if true, but if he indeed lied about this, that he would make such a lie in such a way indicates just how strongly he himself had imbibed a pro-Taiping stance. In that regard, appeals to the memory of the Taiping by the Cantonese plotters of 1903 were likely to have been markedly less absurd than the elite-centric narrative would make it appear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the study of latent Taiping sympathies remains underdeveloped, and it is also not helped by the fact that post-revolutionary cultural output invariably parroted the pro-Taiping line of the KMT and latterly the CCP, just as pre-revolutionary literature had often toed the anti-Taiping line of the Qing. Where these post-revolution, pro-Taiping plays fit on a scale between concessions to state narrative and reflections of genuine popular sentiment is potentially an insoluble question. What is clear is that the connections between the Taiping and Christianity were not necessarily widely known, even to most Chinese Christians, before the 1920s, when Republican scholars travelled to overseas archives to recompile the Taiping textual record from writings that had been rescued by foreign visitors to the Heavenly Kingdom. Sun’s own association of the Taiping with Christianity <em>before</em> the 1920s may have been a particularly individual one, influenced specifically by his alleged family background (or rather, one of his alleged family backgrounds). Pro-Taiping sentiments would therefore have likely been associated with anti-Manchuism, or latterly with social revolution, rather than with Christianity, and that would also likely explain some of the reasoning behind the 1903 attempt.</p>

<p>蒋介石赌性太大，政治敏感性没毛那么高，也就是所谓的心大，虽然比其他军阀已经不是一个级别了，中原大战期间就可以看得出差距。</p>

<p>比如说中山舰，或明明收到消息还非要去西安跳坑，明明是不择手段枭雄的位置却爱惜羽毛想什么都既要又要。</p>

<p>凡事喜欢毕其功于一役，除了体现在内战上外，还有动不动想自杀的观念，抗压能力有待提高。</p>

<p>近代已经是吃军队建制与后勤经济的时代，蒋介石在这方面缺乏控制，沿海的江浙地主与财团阶级支持他，确保了中原大战的经济来源，抗战后金圆券问题就暴露他的性格和先军思维问题，当然也跟本身就在党内分裂的背景有关。</p>

<p>很多蒋介石军事水平低的由来，其背景都是蒋介石个人性格和派系问题导致，没有日本入侵蒋介石统一全国是时间问题，没西安事变中共也难以维系下去，因为是近代，文献够多，可以看到蒋有自己的能力和性格缺陷，但这些都不是最致命的，主要还是不可抗力放大了这些缺点。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2008.2</strong> —–2023-02-19 15:29:11+08:00:</p>

<p>影响我认为不会很大，因为胡汉民后期已经不可能控制蒋了，蒋前期没这个意识，后来开始试图摆脱军事人员的身份，希望转型成为党内领袖，已经跟胡有很多争执矛盾，胡还公开骂蒋。</p>

<p>可当时剿共，还有后来的抗日，都是非常需要军人的特殊时期，本质是枪杆子政权，再到后面内战和到台湾，军权一直都重要，胡汉民活着可能会平衡蒋势力在内部的一些内务工作，让他没法单方面控制一切，但具体要看谁能获得话语权。</p>

<p>胡汉民也控制不了那么多军队，不过右派文职和部分军头可能会向他靠拢，那蒋对他会做什么就很难说了，不过有观点表示胡汉民回国后已经愿意跟蒋合作，双方渡过了磨合期。假设有胡汉民，且跟蒋能互相磨合好的话，不排除一种可能是胡汉民主内，蒋介石主外。</p>

<p>蒋介石保留军权担当委员长，仍然保留元首身份，胡汉民则担以其他职务在政府内部担当类似总理的角色，逐渐形成一个分权框架，为后续宪政做铺垫，但前提是双方能磨合且有意愿划线。</p>

<p>按战时的情况，可能性太多，这是没法确定的，不应该对蒋有太多期望。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.1</strong> —–2023-02-15 23:36:08+08:00:</p>

<p>六四没有成功的说法，当时六四已经不是争取自由化，而是要求修改四二六的定调，这是学生不散的主要原因。</p>

<p>四二六立论目的就是为了后续抓人话柄清洗，事后再做就立不住，所以当时坚决不撤，就是要给人看共产党在这种威权议题下说一不二。</p>

<p>因为六四本身也没具体主要组织负责，也没一个完整的政治目标，心态情绪占主导。</p>

<p>所以最后就变成威权退步与否的问题。</p>

<p>一旦示弱就是开先河，共产党威权带来的寒蝉效应就立不住，这也是为什么邓那么坚持的原因。</p>

<p>结果只有政府服软后学生散去，形成示威习惯。</p>

<p>或者学生服软政府挨个清算，全国大清洗，跟六四后一样，少了杀人的环节。</p>

<p>要么就是政府强硬失策，导致内战。</p>

<p>我们现实走的是第四种路线，学生不服软，政府也不退让，都到了政治生命与利益冲突的前哨站，政府杀人，改革派与同情者被清算。</p>

<p>上面其中三个情况，学生服软被清算也可以给中共在近二十年的社会动荡里提供一次免死金牌，因为子弟兵杀平民的事实还没被坐实。</p>

<p>但是学生和市民选的路线算是与中共同归于尽，中共彻底失去政治挡箭牌，全社会都知道要政治权力就是得拿命换，中共绝不妥协，减少了认知成本，中共也就没了拖延用的缓冲区。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.2</strong> —–2023-02-28 07:31:33+08:00:</p>

<p>不用催泪弹也可以，当时学生已经在逐渐散去，不管的话六月底基本就散了，军方是赶在学生彻底散去前赶时间去围而杀之，目的就是去杀人来形成政治威权形象，从而恫吓全国形成寒蝉效应与服从性。</p>

<p>大概率不会，邓小平目的是保护经济改革之余，确保政治体制与执政党不变，并且希望随后的岁月，伴随经济发展，社会与中共能找到内部变革的可能性，但根本上还是要确保体制不变。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.5</strong> —–2023-03-01 21:44:05+08:00:</p>

<p>邓的核心逻辑是确保经济改革，确保政治改革在他这一代不变，至于后代怎么样，大体就是“相信后人的智慧”的翻版，客观上邓很清楚只要经济改革推进，政治体制必然面临被质疑动摇的处境，但他把思考和解决这个问题的事，全都甩给五十年后了。</p>

<p>没明白指再来一次什么</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.7</strong> —–2023-03-01 23:46:24+08:00:</p>

<p>当时示威仍然陆陆续续存在，这种自发性的集体行为一直都有，只是此消彼长不如刚开始热度高。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.8</strong> —–2023-03-02 00:47:11+08:00:</p>

<p>九七年邓死前自由化没被打击，都有可能寻找机会开枪，六四不止是广场上的一次事件，而是之后还有漫长十余年对党内外自由化与支持自由化个人的肃清与排挤，六四在当时也是全国性的，邓与保守派元老都迫切需要血腥镇压来立威，只不过越到后期，社会经济越发达，这种做法的成本也就越高。</p>

<p>比如说现代和未来二十年，政府哪怕大规模暴力镇压，不需要动枪械射杀平民，法理都会受到巨大冲击。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.9</strong> —–2023-03-02 10:14:36+08:00:</p>

<p>这个问题就涉及到六四的根本了</p>

<p>六四本质是军事政变，邓自己支持胡赵推行建制化，职务大于天，但六四是绕过了赵紫阳军委第一副主席的身份，军队的调动实际上是不合法的。</p>

<p>邓是靠个人威望与军队的纽带关系，绕开了中央的体系，压制了内部反对声音，从而实行镇压。</p>

<p>实际上军队内部反对和疑惑声音很大，张爱萍等将领联名反对，党内最高层意见也不统一，国务院的高层甚至有人做好打内战的准备。</p>

<p>六四执行后，党内外许多有资历但地位不是很高的老人，都彻底放弃中共，邓直接把中共与共和国的存在的合法法理根基搞没了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.10</strong> —–2023-03-02 16:06:07+08:00:</p>

<p>军队调动直接看军委公开的资料就行，其实执行上一点也不复杂，多次军改和实践已经尽可能简化了。</p>

<p>因为党指挥枪的原则，军委本质是个执行管理机构，是中委会的下辖机构，但是一般最高领导都有兼任的情况，因此执行管理其实落到了副职甚至更下一层部门身上，然后才是各个部门特定的工作范畴。</p>

<p>包括邓小平在内，也是通过军委联络，但是不符合程序没人敢出来质疑，这就成了心照不宣的问题。</p>

<p>进而就把中共军制的本质给暴露出来，因为以前重大问题是有最高层决议的，现在虽然命令还是上面走军委调兵，但显然有不合法理的地方。</p>

<p>准备好打内战的出处，是英国当时驻华大使Alan Donald的解密电报与文档。</p>

<p>2017年解密后就有陆续报道，中文媒体方面，香港01在相关文档解密做了相对完整报道，Alan Donald似乎还有些相关的回忆录，我不确定他在这些自传书籍里有没有提及。</p>

<p>另外如果情况属实，国务院实际来来去去就那些人而已，跟Alan Donald走的特别近的高层消息人士，职务最低也是国务委员，也就是说至少是副国级，并且可能是中委会成员。</p>

<p>这是其中一部分：</p>

<p>做不到，因为学生本身也没组织，目标整体没那么激进，只是一直以来对反自由化不满，以及胡耀邦去世引发的自发性的临时反应。</p>

<p>后来为了维持秩序出现的一些组织，互相不统属，谁也管不到谁，目的也只是现场处理问题而已，从胡耀邦去世到六四被镇压，前后就两个月不到。</p>

<p>如果有空间能进行大规模组织转移到农村，还能进行有效宣传，那武装建立军队也是完全可以的，中共离死就不远了，不过现实不具备这种基础。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.12</strong> —–2023-03-06 23:00:34+08:00:</p>

<p>从来没镇压，那么可以确定自由化浪潮注定越来越高，最后改革派在内部主政推动政治改革，把保守派边缘化。</p>

<p>但现实来说，保守派是不可能什么都不做等死的，因为实际结果就是，在自由化刚冒头的早期，保守派已经把下限拉低到杀人解决问题这种简单粗暴的管理手法，宁可扔掉自己的合法性也不愿意放弃政权。</p>

<p>贸易冲突仍然可能有，但我想到不了普遍制裁的情况，因为当下制裁的一个原因是现代中国政治与经济体系互不匹配产生的落后，无法对接外部世界的各种需求产生的意识形态矛盾，是不可调和的。</p>

<p>防火墙可以肯定没有，太子党应该会存在，但是不会跟保守派扶持一样接班，而是逐渐转型为政治世家，真和平放权了，太子党出身靠自己走动拉票，走公开竞选程序当选，其实也没什么。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.13</strong> —–2023-03-07 15:31:55+08:00:</p>

<p>中国与越南并不相同，社会自由化浪潮高涨，胡赵新政既有党内支持，也有政绩基础，政治改革是放权，不意味着瞬间结束一党专政，胡赵的政治体制改革也不是以结束共产党执政为目标。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.14</strong> —–2023-03-07 22:51:10+08:00:</p>

<p>先看一下这句话的语境是在说什么。</p>

<p>前面有人在说不在天安门聚集，是否能转移到农村煽动农民反公粮反计划生育。</p>

<p>我明确的说了：“ 如果有空间能进行大规模组织转移到农村，还能进行有效宣传 ”。</p>

<p>也就是说，如果环境都允许无组织的学生转移到农村煽动农民，也即说明中共在国内基层根本无控制力，对市以下的县级行政区域处于完全的权力真空。</p>

<p>全国有约2800个县级行政区，无法控制这些地区还能让学生进行组织和宣传，那本质就是回到了三十年代。</p>

<p>所以搞清楚这种基本语境，不可能搞不明白在说什么：</p>

<p>1）武装哪里来？</p>

<p>到农村宣传首先要有组织，其次要中共在地方权力真空。</p>

<p>如果能到地方进行宣传，说明有组织，以及权力真空的既定事实。</p>

<p>那么能进行宣传，意味着成立组织的那一刻，存续问题也得到解决。</p>

<p>物理意义上的存续环境，是一切开始的基础，能在基层行政区组织超过一定人数超过半年，任何渠道的武装都有可能。</p>

<p>2）无组织无纪律训练，乌合之众耳。</p>

<p>同上。</p>

<p>他假设的环境都是需要有组织和生存环境才能实现的命题，就不会还有无组织无纪律这种情况了，所以我前面就说了不可能。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.15</strong> —–2023-03-08 00:16:47+08:00:</p>

<p>都到了要杀人表态的节骨眼了，这种时候还不下死手，就已经表明对自由化的妥协。</p>

<p>从职务上胡赵对上保守派并不弱势，压力主要来自于邓的取向。</p>

<p>邓就是因为不愿意妥协才杀人，如果肯妥协，胡也不会下台，更谈不上弱势，这是个因果关系。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.16</strong> —–2023-03-08 01:48:13+08:00:</p>

<p>越南的政治体制改革不等于中国的政治体制改革，很多东西表面改了光说不做，说的好听也没用，政治体制的基石是经济发展这是改变不了的，经济越进步越需要改革，否则落后的不发达社会冠名共和制，也只会出现世袭的总统。</p>

<p>越南才发展没多少年，还有很大进步空间，没有成熟的群众基础，这种改革无论是自上而下还是自下而上都肯定会产生压力，所以重点是经济改革，因为政治改革是经济发展的后续衍生品。</p>

<p>如果胡赵路线不对，那中国何来今天的经济发展和现代化政府？</p>

<p>你可以这样反问质疑者，他们大多会回答经济改革的成果不是胡赵路线带来之类的，也是六四后保守派摘桃子的一个经典例子。</p>

<p>基本中国大部分重要的现代化改革，都是胡赵时期决策预期实现和制定路线的，我们能早过其他竞争者快速发展，吸取全球消费数十年之久，就是因为当时胡赵做出了正确的选择和预判，让中国赢在起跑线上。</p>

<p>胡赵路线究竟是什么？其实很多反对或评价的人，许多人不知道，他都不知道自己在评价什么，所以你能想象到五花八门的论调，很多时候挺无厘头的</p>

<p>那这样偏离事实，就更不可能找到准确对比去进行认知。</p>

<p>越南基本比中国晚最少十年进行革新，九十年代初到中期才开始全面的正常化。</p>

<p>而国际市场有限，中国体量过于庞大，已经提前吸收了大部分需求市场，这也是为什么印度也发展慢的原因，要说的话其实越南印度都不慢，只是中国更快。</p>

<p>而印度九十年代甚至部分计划经济制度是两千年才废除的，比越南还慢。</p>

<p>胡赵路线的第一阶段：</p>

<p>中国提前在计划经济国家里走出一个新赛道，占据了有限的市场位置。</p>

<p>避开了与后发展的穷国、人口大国进行劳动力内卷的竞争，错开了人力最贱的时候。</p>

<p>要不然同期印度、越南这种人口十几亿和近亿的国家，跟我们一起卷，我们发展会慢很多，许多消费市场会流入他们那里。</p>

<p>但我们更早发展，比苏联改革的正确，比印度越南走的更早，就占据了一个产业链里相对有优势的位置，还能转化部分生产力到更上游。</p>

<p>胡赵路线的第二阶段：</p>

<p>他们也迟早会发展成跟我们一样，那么我们就必须跟日韩北欧一样，解放私营经济的生产力，在产业链里占据一个更上游的位置，找到一个不会被取代淘汰的固定角色。</p>

<p>此时解放权力就很重要，市场经济就是权力下放，权力下放解绑，知识分子才有生存和发展空间，全国统一规划，慢慢下放权力到地方，形成各地按自己需求进行分工和发展，形成内部良性竞争。</p>

<p>这时候中央就只扮演一个调度角色，而不是原来的统筹角色。</p>

<p>那么解放权力，就是政治体制改革的一个目的之一，就是让更多人参与到这个更复杂的社会结构来，从而提高监督性和运作效率。</p>

<p>所以说，你想一下，很多人否定和反对的胡赵改革，批评者自身就是吃了胡赵改革红利，但是胡赵改革还只实现了经济部分，政治部分还没展开实现就出现六四了。</p>

<p>去用已经成功然后被保守派摘桃子说是自己功绩的事，去指摘一个还没来得及实现的胡赵路线，怎么想都不应该吧，没有立场去站在这种角度说话的。</p>

<p>越南从06-08年才开始明显高速增长，中国也还没完全脱离这个赛道，他们要发展起码等我们发展到相当程度后，才能吃掉空出来的市场，按年数和GDP翻倍数，我们可能还慢了，因为进入两千年后大规模的结构性改革基本停滞，框架没变，也是为什么我们现在遇到发展困境和社会公平问题。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.17</strong> —–2023-03-08 02:11:49+08:00:</p>

<p>因为本身是没有任何组织的自发行为，天安门大家都知道在哪，农村是个名词，不是一个具体地方，没有组织就没有人会刻意去农村。</p>

<p>表达诉求是对当局表达，而不是对不能解决问题的农民表达，他们的情况大多是“有感而发”，没有统筹全部学生的终端组织，不存在决策意识，一切有领导核心与执行组织的情节都不存在于该集体。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.18</strong> —–2023-03-08 12:26:06+08:00:</p>

<p>撤了就散了，更没组织，坚持不撤其中一个重要原因，就是四月本来要散了，但四二六社论出来，可以作为挨个秋后算账的政治盖棺定论，所以要趁着人齐聚在一起把这个定性给扭转过来避免被清算。</p>

<p>邓下令前，学生也想不到会这么没下限，就算侥幸撤退，四二六社论在，也只会秋后算账，六四本身也没杀光所有参与运动的学生、市民和工人，但后续也反对不了。</p>

<p>说白了是朝堂政治，民间只能倒逼，没实质性的基础，这也是民间运动的一个弊病，只要政权没下限，你拿他没办法。</p>

<p>剩下的只是对民间妥协与否的问题，不妥协就是不惜一切代价镇压，妥协了就是默许自由化的存在，中共是威权政权，妥协与否涉及到政权的存续性质。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.19</strong> —–2023-03-08 13:15:30+08:00:</p>

<p>政治环境应该与今天无异，因为胡赵对保守派打压自由化的要求都是偏消极的，没有解决中共不妥协的问题，保守派依然存在且把持人事权，胡赵改革派在人事权上被邓边缘化仍然难以避免。</p>

<p>杀人其实把事做绝了，主要堵死的是未来中共保守派找台阶下的道路。</p>

<p>如果没杀，中共在现代和未来，仍然会有和平改革的契机，但是六四的杀人，过早把最终手段暴露出来，一下大大降低了不稳定时社会动荡形态的阈值。</p>

<p>变成了要么彻底推翻政权避免被杀，要么杀光反对者保证政权的零和游戏。</p>

<p>不杀人，还能保留一个中间缓冲区域进行拉扯谈判。</p>

<p>对邓来说，杀人更像是一种政治表态，直接拿出最后维护政权的手段，而忽略了法理。</p>

<p>没有杀人，中共的法理会更健全完善，胡温假设敢于改革和想改革，那么话题是比较容易打开。</p>

<p>但问题在于，六四奠定了保守派在党内的话语权与合法性基础，这就造成了与六四相关的政治改革，即便改革派和团派一些人想部分推行，也会因为涉及到保守派根本利益而无法提出。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2009.20</strong> —–2023-03-09 02:28:53+08:00:</p>

<p>不解决保守派人事权的问题，就无法改变红色子弟逐渐上位的可能。</p>

<p>查了一下，党主立宪可能是指06年中央党校研究室课题组的《从经济发展角度思考和设计政治体制改革》</p>

<p>按文章本身的观点，是对现有结构做优化，能看出来有过渡意味，但这种观念历来不少，只是反应到行政和人事上就很困难。</p>

<p>只能说是党内有观点希望推行的一个蓝图，并不是实际产物，胡锦涛风评的政治偏保守，但也不瞎折腾，允许党内讨论这些其实也不容易了，温家宝是公开提过的，整体胡温时代虽然也是威权主义，但也会提及这些东西，是相对宽松。</p>

<p>至于因为茉莉花革命流产，我认为不可能，习近平接班在茉莉花革命前就敲定了， 保守派一直存在，要不然胡赵时期就已经能做过渡了。</p>

<p>那直接验证一下中防委这个机构是否属实可查证就明白了。</p>

<p>徐友安这个人到的确是可查，还出过防卫技术书籍，但问题来了，为什么刚好叫防卫技术管理委员会，还在有官方背景的武术推广中心的负责人，以及武术协会92年届的副主席和副秘书长。</p>

<p>那么隐秘的部门，有私人卫队还特地告诉当事人，又被当事人就这么放到网上说，还是负责监控最高领导和各级官僚，那么负责对象是谁？没有这个具体责任人。</p>

<p>然后就这么一个小圈子，他直接把几个参与的人的真实姓名连职务都一并曝光，跟着这个中防委的许多对外事务都是通过博客发表。</p>

<p>整体可查证性就这些了，如果不属实，性质自然不用说，如果人与事经过属实，却无可考，那我不清楚这些人聚在一起是干什么，从他们身份和所谓保密来看，没证据显示他们真有能力影响证据，没准只是体制内中基层的一些人聚首发牢骚，或者可以联想一下 “联合国维和部队总司令部“这个事。</p>

<p>跨部委机构，简单说就是继续加强集权，但靠拢对象是党，而非政府。</p>

<p>最早期没联网时，各地警察和行政部门互联程度非常低，七八十年代更夸张。</p>

<p>两千年后逐渐开始联网，习近平前两个任期做了基层部门数据、执行上的串联改革，以前警察在基层进数据库随便查，或者吃空饷就很难挂住了。</p>

<p>基层行政部门自行决定执行和策略的空间减少，因为联网后这部分决策权往省市走，省市的行政单位少，中央更容易控制。</p>

<p>其实这几年一直在做，不是突然搬出来的，铺垫很久了。</p>

<p>现在主要是把更细分领域的决策权，从行政中一定程度剥离，让渡给更高层的党务机构，就像市的发展，取决于市委书记和党委，市长不是最大的那个。</p>

<p>过去也不是没有，但是在一些新兴领域，金融、科研和社会发展的细致层面，原来的行政部门覆盖不到，而原本这些要靠推行司法独立和行政制度的东西，因为不可能搞司法独立和党政分离，所以既是为了例行集权，也是为了抓过来管，就开始加强党委在这些领域的实权。</p>

<p>执政体系慢慢平行出一个党委影子政府，剥离行政政府的决策和执行权。</p>

<p>共和国原来的执政体系，是国务院是正常的政府行政机构，政策要通过该机构内部反馈进行决策、执行，中共是作为执政党控制其主导权。</p>

<p>也就是说专政还是要通过合法政府才能施行，但现在在中央直属层面，平移出一些党政属性更强的机构，等于一定程度绕开了政府主体的行政，削弱政府机构本身的决策权，弱化其职能。</p>

<p>六四是突发事件，四二六社论出来时，性质就定调了，赵这个时候就不好独自做主张。</p>

<p>期间赵外访，导致失去对定调的干预权，事后看可能就是故意针对他可能反对的情况，挑机会处理的。</p>

<p>放假和催泪弹都很难解决问题，反而可能激化，赵走前的方案已经是尽可能不要激起矛盾，引发冲突，慢慢的让人群消散。</p>

<p>但是邓和保守派显然不愿意，赵就只能选择跟随，或者跑出来给警示了。</p>

<p>时间上赵没有太多选择，政治上可能大意了，趁着赵不在要把党内定调，生米煮成熟饭。</p>

<p>利用赵的警惕心没到最高，麻痹赵然后生米煮成熟饭。</p>

<p>但邓只是让赵离开中枢，避免起冲突，然后让赵接受结果。</p>

<p>两人真正翻脸是五月份开会决定清场，赵坚决不跟随邓，此前邓不高兴但是没放弃赵，把赵支开也是知道他不同意。</p>

<p>很多人认为是骗赵，我觉得这是不了解邓赵关系，以及赵在当时政治面貌的说法。</p>

<p>赵紫阳在六四决议前，与邓没有什么矛盾，一直到戈尔巴乔夫讲话也只是邓不满，而没打算换掉赵，赵反而是一个在邓、自由化、陈云之间周旋的角色。</p>

<p>但是民间对赵紫阳还没如对胡耀邦一样了解，所以也有连赵紫阳一起骂的事发生。</p>

<p>也即是说，实际情况上，赵紫阳已经是第一军委副主席，获得军权只是时间问题，只要赵紫阳支持邓，军权最终必然会过渡到他手上，因为当时党政军指定赵紫阳已经很明确了，只不过在六四镇压话题上，赵紫阳坚决不跟随，让邓无可选择放弃了他。</p>

<p>六四是全国性运动，并且赵无最终决策权，决策权在邓身上，邓在文革末期受四五运动的支持，六四继承了这类运动的风气，也是为什么邓没一开始驱散，脸也挂不住，赵认为有人煽风点火，推动邓最终决定肃清自由化，或者说即便没有，最后也会倾斜到这一侧。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1110.1</strong> —–2023-02-16 06:41:09+08:00:</p>

<p>Were I being glib, I’d call the fact that the Taiping lost their biggest setback by far, but somehow I feel like that’s not quite the question you’re asking. Now, the definition of what makes a setback ‘major’ is going to be one that can be quibbled over endlessly, so if you disagree with my choices that is fundamentally a you problem, this is my opinion gosh darn it and you asked for it.</p>

<p>If we’re going to talk about setbacks in terms of individual historical moments, then the closest analogue to the so-called ‘Tianjing Incident’ would probably be the Taiping loss of Anqing in September 1861, following a year-long siege by the Hunan Army. For the early part of the war, the Taiping were able to draw on most of the lower Yangtze basin as their economic base, as well as using it for strategic depth against Qing counteroffensives downriver towards Nanjing. Wuchang, which changed hands several times, was lost permanently to the Taiping by 1856, but there was still around 600km along the Yangtze from there to Nanjing. Anqing, which stood at the halfway mark between these two cities, served two purposes. Firstly, it served as a stronghold protecting the region between it and Nanjing, keeping that region firmly within Taiping control. Secondly, it remained viable as a forward staging ground for operations upriver, including onto Lake Poyang, which was critical for maintaining lines of communication in northern Jiangxi. When Anqing fell, effectively the entire western half of the Heavenly Kingdom collapsed almost overnight. More or less all Taiping territory upriver from Anqing, including Jiangxi, would effectively be back in Qing hands by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Taiping did make attempts to relieve the siege. For one, harassing attacks against the Hunan Army were attempted, in hopes that sufficient losses would induce them to withdraw. But perhaps the boldest attempt took the form of an attempted attack on Wuchang, which had been left with a minimal garrison thanks to the Hunan Army’s investment of Anqing. With one army under Chen Yucheng marching on the northern bank of the Yangtze, and another under Li Xiucheng on the south, they would converge on the under-defended city, cutting the Hunan Army’s line of retreat, and then march back downriver to crush it once and for all. However, the armies, which set out in October 1860, faced unexpected challenges. After capturing Huangzhou in March, Chen found that the city of Hankou, on the opposite bank of the Yangtze, was now a treaty port subject to vaguely-defined protections by the British, and so, pressured by British diplomats, he chose not to press the attack until he had received instructions from Nanjing. This bought time for the defenders of the cities, who were reinforced while Chen was forced to remain in place. Li, meanwhile, chose to take a relatively circuitous path through Jiangxi and Hubei in order to gather additional recruits, losing valuable time. When he arrived near Wuchang in May, he found that the Hunanese fleet had firm control over the river, and was unable to get the British consulate to deliver messages to and from Chen (that is to say that they willingly received the letters, and then chose to keep hold of them instead). Having lost the initiative and with no ability to coordinate, Li retreated in June. Chen, for his part, had abandoned the attempt against Wuchang back in April, and attempted to relieve the siege directly, circumvallating the Hunan Army’s own siege lines. However, he himself was hemmed in by a Qing cavalry force that lay across his potential line of retreat to Taiping-held Tongcheng. In May, Hong Rengan was tasked with defeating the imperial cavalry and reopening communications between Tongcheng and Chen’s forces, but he failed, and Chen would then retreat into northern Anhui, where he would later be betrayed by a local warlord whom he was attempting to ally with.</p>

<p>But as the above chronology suggests, there was another, more persistent setback, less a singular moment and more a perennial problem, and that was the abject failure of Taiping diplomacy. The failure of the Taiping to solicit British, French, or American support in 1853-4 was arguably an integral factor in the former two countries going to war with the Qing in 1856-60 for expanded trade access, which meant that while they were fighting against the Qing in the <em>short</em> term, in the <em>long</em> term they were staking on a Qing victory against the Taiping. After all, what reason was there to believe that the Taiping would honour treaties that had been signed by the Qing, their mortal enemies? Whether any diplomatic overtures after 1856 could have made a difference is an open question, but in the event, the foreign community in China by and large opposed the Taiping, and in turn influenced their home governments to do the same. As we have seen, British chicanery around the treaty ports doomed the Taiping attempt to relieve Anqing, and even before outright military intervention in 1862-4, Britain and France were giving more than tacit support to the Qing militarily: the Taiping were prevented from taking Shanghai in 1860, and in early 1862 foreign steamers shipped the newly-formed Anhui Army from Anqing to Shanghai to support the city’s defence. It is an open question as to how integral foreign support was to the Qing’s victory, but you could make a decent case for there being somewhat more certainty going the other way: the Taiping’s defeat can be attributed in no small part to the failure of foreign support to materialise.</p>

<p>As a slightly pedantic correction, this does depend on which German state you’re looking at, but Schützen were still skirmishers. In the (Napoleonic) Prussian army, Schützen were designated marksmen and skirmishers within line regiments, often issued with rifles; this distinguished them from Jäger who were full-sized skirmisher battalions. In the Austrian army, Landwehr skirmisher companies were designated as Schützen, while regular skirmisher battalions were Jäger. As a general rule though, Schütze was a term specifically applied to <em>rifle</em>men as opposed to musketeers.</p>

<p>My local club likes to refer to the ‘three-foot rule’ – if it looks good from 3 feet away, then it looks good.</p>

<p>I’ll also note that the size of a historicals army may seem daunting, but it depends what kind of game you’re playing. If you’re going full-on big battles then yes, you may well be looking at three-digit numbers for each side, but for a larger skirmish game like <em>Sharp Practice</em> or <em>Rebels and Patriots</em>, 40-60 per side is much more typical. And then you have some micro-skirmish sets like <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> or <em>A Fistful of Lead</em> (both Wild West games to be fair) where you can get a game in with as few as 6-10 figures. So it’s really a matter of not just the individual figure scale, but also the scale of engagement you’re interested in.</p>

<p>Interestingly, you can also detect some form of that narrative in some Taiping texts: there’s one proclamation in which Yang Xiuqing alleges that the Qing were an extractive colonial regime redirecting Chinese wealth to Manchuria, and there’s a manifesto in which Hong Rengan, showing off his knowledge of world affairs, likens Manchu rule over China to Turkic rule over Iran in the Qajar empire. So I do wonder how far Social Darwinism and the like managed to serve as an independent source of a narrative of the Manchu Qing as a distinct and separate imperial conqueror, as opposed to contributing to an already widely-known narrative.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1113.2</strong> —–2023-02-26 22:37:17+08:00:</p>

<p>Yeah, it definitely can’t be denied that there was some kind of shift occasioned by intellectual exchange with the West, but it can be all too easy to dismiss existing anti-Qing narratives simply because, to be fair, they are very hard to detect except in moments of exceptional rupture like the Taiping uprising and the contemporaneous revolts in Yunnan. It’s all just a bit hazy and frustrating.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1118.1</strong> —–2023-02-20 21:27:00+08:00:</p>

<p>I was going to gripe about Star Trek but that was going to be an in-fandom thing, so wouldn’t fit. So it’s VTuber time.</p>

<p>Honestly, my biggest bugbear is the assertion that VTubing is somehow indelibly inseparable from ‘idol culture’. Now, /u/ZekesLeftNipple below has explained why ‘idol culture’ is unfairly maligned, so I won’t go over that part; what I will go over is the fact that the narrative that VTubers are just a new form of idols is  not as straightforward as it may appear, even if I will not deny that the links do exist.</p>

<p>If we look at the genealogy of VTubing, then yes, idols have absolutely been a part of that, but not all VTubers are directly or indirectly idol-related. Kizuna AI <em>was</em> explicitly idol-influenced, while Hololive’s Tokino Sora has stated that she was interested in becoming an idol and joined Hololive because of that, but otherwise, most early VTubers were a mixture of established livestreamers and tech enthusiasts, with idol types as exceptions. The Japanese VTuber scene, both creators and fans, built itself out of a variety of subcultures: anime, livestreaming, let’s plays, utaite (cover singers), Vocaloids, and yes, idols, but not all of them are present in equal measure in all cases. Within Japan, Hololive is basically the only particularly prominent VTuber agency to have any kind of explicit idol imagery, and critically, it doesn’t have a monopoly on the domestic market, as it very much jostles for space both with Nijisanji and a variety of smaller players. Nijisanji, for its part, does concerts but very much does not advertise itself as being idol-related, which is basically true of other variety agencies like 774. Then there’s VSPO, which I believe is now the third-largest of the agencies by audience size (though it is also now technically a sub-agency under Brave Group), which is exclusively a gaming network, no idols to be found. To illustrate my point here, Nijisanji’s Honma Himawari <a href="https://youtu.be/7dGJ4BfRg2E?t=252">explicitly highlighted Hololive’s idol image as something she was particularly struck by</a> in a guest appearance on one of Omaru Polka’s <em>Legend of Polka</em> variety segments back in October 2021. This is not the sort of thing you would observe if idols and the broader idol culture were fundamentally ingrained into VTubing.</p>

<p>The prominence of the idol narrative in English-language discussion is, IMO, very much a product of the nature of the English-language space, thanks to Hololive English’s first generation, Myth, being the major popularisers of VTubing in the Anglosphere. Myth’s semi-ironic references to themselves as idols did a lot to shape the view of VTubers in the West, particularly during the year or so that Myth completely dominated the EN scene. And this was despite the existence of quite an old pre-Myth EN VTubing scene – Ironmouse, whom many will have heard of, began streaming using FaceRig on 17 August 2017, and as such in fact predates <em>all</em> of Hololive. But if you look at things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzodvcvUxbQ">her recent birthday concert</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VShojo/comments/rj5f9w/congratulations_to_nyanners_ironmouse_and/">her appearance on VILLS with Silvervale and Nyanners</a>, she’s definitely happy to lean into it. More recently, the not-so-subtly-named Idol Corp., based in Israel, has been carving its own niche in the EN scene, as a post-Myth ‘idol’ agency. But plenty of EN VTubers <em>don’t</em> do this. NijiEN definitely isn’t an idol agency, and neither are most indies: someone like <a href="https://t.co/nvdgYkOQKP">Froot</a> or <a href="https://t.co/0t4TJZLwnM">obkatiekat</a> would never be mistaken for idols by anyone.</p>

<p>The essential problem with this narrative of course is that it leads people to project a lot of ideas onto VTubers that simply aren’t universally applicable, and which are outright wrong when the inaccurate stereotypical image of ‘idols’, as described in the linked post, is the one being held. VTubers as a whole are <em>far</em> more varied and nuanced than can be captured by the idea of ‘idol culture’, and while I will not demand that everyone starts watching them, I will say that it would be helpful if outsiders didn’t just make assumptions based on a particular, distinct cultural phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Submission statement:</strong> NATO was created to prevent a major war in Europe, a task it accomplished well for many decades. Apart from the brief Kosovo war in 1999, its members never had to fight together or coordinate a joint response to aggression—until a year ago, when Russia invaded Ukraine. NATO’s response thus offers fresh, real-world evidence about how contemporary alliances work in practice.</p>

<p>The recent behavior of Russia and the West confirms that states form alliances not to balance against power but to balance against threats. The way NATO has done so has also revealed much about both the alliance’s virtues and its enduring pathologies. The war may have given NATO a new lease on life and shown the value of its well-established procedures, but it also underscores the degree to which its European members remain dangerously dependent on the United States.</p>

<p>As the world moves toward multipolarity, alliances will only matter more. In an age when no single country stands unchallenged atop the international system, success will depend on rival powers’ ability to form a coherent and capable grouping and exercise power collectively. Above all, the invasion of Ukraine and its aftermath show that leaders court disaster if they fail to understand why alliances form and how they work.</p>

<p>—– <strong>354.1</strong> —–2023-02-15 01:01:07+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Evan Feigenbaum and Adam Szubin:</strong> When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, China’s leaders attempted to balance two fundamentally irreconcilable interests. First, they aimed to bolster China’s entente with Russia to counterbalance American power and alleviate growing strategic pressure from the West. Second, although they backed Moscow, they sought to avoid unilateral and coordinated sanctions aimed at China’s government, companies, and financial institutions.</p>

<p>For a year, China has been performing the “Beijing straddle,” tacking uncomfortably between these competing objectives under the white-hot light of international scrutiny. China has generally refused to sell arms to Russia and to circumvent sanctions on Moscow’s behalf because preserving global market access is more important to Beijing than any economic link to Russia. Simply put, China has no interest in being Russia’s proxy. But Beijing has also tried to have its cake and eat it, too, by endorsing Russia’s rationales for the conflict, coordinating with Moscow diplomatically while it cautiously abstains in United Nations votes, taking full advantage of discounted Russian oil, and enhancing economic linkages to Russia that do not violate Western sanctions. Indeed, China-Russia trade rose by a staggering 34.3 percent in 2022 to a record $190 billion.</p>

<p>Beijing has also learned important lessons even as it struggles to maintain this balance. Specifically, it has closely studied the Western-led sanctions campaign. And it knows that, if tensions with the West continue to intensify, these same economic weapons may well be turned against China. Over the last 20 years, China’s leaders have watched as Washington honed and more frequently deployed economic weaponry, including sanctions, export controls, investment restrictions, and tariffs. But the major Western sanctions campaigns have generally not applied to China because they targeted second-tier economies, such as Iran and Iraq, or more often, marginal economies such as Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan. The current Ukraine conflict has, at long last, given Beijing an opportunity to study the strategy, tactics, and capabilities of a Western sanctions coalition as it works to cripple one of the world’s largest economies.</p>

<p>Of course, in some ways, it is too soon for Beijing to draw the full range of lessons from the Western sanctions effort against Russia. The sanctions include both measures that have instant effect, such as asset freezes, and those that are designed to bite ever more deeply in the years to come. Among the latter are export controls on computer chips and advanced technologies and restrictions on helping Russia develop the deep-water, Arctic, and shale resources on which its future energy revenues depend. But China has already absorbed certain key lessons, some of which are sobering. Perhaps the most important has nothing to do with payment systems or oil tankers but is rather about the power of international partnerships.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong> Despite a series of blunders, miscalculations, and battlefield reversals that would have surely seen him thrown out of office in most normal countries, President Vladimir Putin is still at the pinnacle of power in Russia. He continues to define the contours of his country’s war against Ukraine. He is micromanaging the invasion even as generals beneath him appear to be in charge of the battlefield. (This deputizing is done to protect him from blowback if something goes badly wrong in the war.) Putin and those immediately around him directly work to mobilize Russians on the home front and manipulate public views of the invasion abroad. He has in some ways succeeded in this information warfare.</p>

<p>The war has revealed the full extent of Putin’s personalized political system. After what is now 23 years at the helm of the Russian state, there are no obvious checks on his power. Institutions beyond the Kremlin count for little. “I would never have imagined that I would miss the Politburo,” said Rene Nyberg, the former Finnish ambassador to Moscow. “There is no political organization in Russia that has the power to hold the president and commander in chief accountable.” Diplomats, policymakers, and analysts are stuck in a doom loop—an endless back-and-forth argument among themselves—to figure out what Putin wants and how the West can shape his behavior.</p>

<p>Determining Putin’s actual objectives can be difficult; as an anti-Western autocrat, he has little to gain by publicly disclosing his intentions. But the last year has made some answers clear enough. Since February 2022, the world has learned that Putin wants to create a new version of the Russian empire based on his Soviet-era preoccupations and his interpretations of history. The launching of the invasion itself has shown that his views of past events can provoke him to cause massive human suffering. It has become clear that there is little other states and actors can do to deter Putin from prosecuting a war if he is determined to do so and that the Russian president will adapt old narratives as well as adopt new ones to suit his purposes.</p>

<p>But the events of 2022 and early 2023 have demonstrated that there are ways to constrain Putin, especially if a broad enough coalition of states gets involved. They have also underscored that the West will need to redouble its efforts at strengthening such a diplomatic and military coalition. Because even now, after a year of carnage, Putin is still convinced he can prevail.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong> Over the course of the war in Ukraine, the strategies of Russia and Ukraine have increasingly diverged. At first, Russia sought to catch Ukraine by surprise using a modern army engaged in some fast-moving maneuvers that would yield a rapid and decisive victory. But over time, its army has been seriously degraded, and it has increasingly been relying on artillery barrages and mass infantry assaults to achieve battlefield breakthroughs while stepping up its attacks on Ukrainian cities. In the areas its forces are occupying, it is seeking to impose “Russification” and has dealt harshly with those suspected of spying and sabotage, or simple dissent.</p>

<p>Ukraine has been more innovative in its tactics and more disciplined in their execution. Aided by a growing supply of Western weapons and an agile command, it has managed to recover some of the areas occupied by Russian forces. But it has also been fighting on its own territory and unable to reach far into Russia. So while Ukraine has limited itself to targeting Russia’s military, Russia is targeting Ukraine as a whole: its armed forces, its infrastructure, and its people.</p>

<p>These contrasting approaches—the “classic warfare” pursued by Ukraine and the “total warfare” adopted by Russia—have deep roots in the wars of the twentieth century. As the war in Ukraine reaches its one-year mark, it has begun to offer significant insights into how these two forms of warfare can cope in contemporary conflicts—and how they are likely to shape the contest between Kyiv and Moscow in the coming months.</p>

  <p>“But wouldn’t Mandarin be better for work?”</p>

<p>I mean the key thing to remember is that the standardisation of Chinese around Mandarin is a north-Chinese, Han-centric hegemonic initiative to destroy regional distinctiveness in pursuit of a singular national homogeny in an attempt to sustain the necrotic remnants of Manchu dynastic imperialism.</p>

  <p>even if I think people overstate it by indicating it was a veiled slur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can make the case that it’s <em>theoretically</em> not. In the Wade-Giles Romanisation of Mandairn, ‘Chang Cho’ corresponds to Pinyin ‘Zhang Zhuo’, and there <em>are</em> people today named that (typically 張卓/张卓).</p>

<p>However, I am sceptical that Rowling was looking meaningfully at Mandarin names, or at their context, because if she had then she’d have been aware that bisyllabic given names are much more common. Moreover, the fact that ‘Cho Chang’ is <em>a</em> plausible name is not the same as saying it is the <em>only</em> plausible name that could have been chosen, and it’s the nature of that choice, not the plausibility of the outcome, that is being contended over. I can’t speculate over Rowling’s intentions because I’m not inside her brain, but I’ll certainly grant that ‘Cho Chang’ is, at the <em>very least</em>, distinctly ‘generic Asian’-sounding and at worst infantilisingly racist, even if Rowling wasn’t consciously evoking the particular slur being discussed.</p>

<p>By way of clumsy and, I will fully admit, not particularly comparable analogy, it’d be like me naming a German character ‘Adolf Goering’ and saying ‘well Adolf is a real name, and there are still Goerings about, which means the name is plausible and there is no specific intention behind me choosing that particular first name and surname combination.’ Or, more frivolously, if I named a character ‘Gaylord Cockburn’ you would imagine some kind of intentionality to it. That’s how I see ‘Cho Chang’.</p>

<p>It absolutely doesn’t help that to Chinese cultural elites, non-Mandarin languages are essentially branded as ‘lesser’, or as relics to be consigned to the dustbin of linguistic extinction.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1092.8</strong> —–2023-02-11 08:51:39+08:00:</p>

<p>While it’s true that evidence of experience is typically required, that’s not to say that only people with substantial <em>popularity</em> get in. Speaking for HoloID’s 3rd generation, Zeta and Kaela were very minor pre-Hololive, and I don’t think <em>anyone</em> knows who Kobo was beforehand. As for Tempus (base game), only Magni was <em>that</em> substantially followed. Altare and Axel were pretty minor, while Vesper had a bit more audience but was still relatively niche. Arguably HoloCouncil was unusual in just how heavy-hitting those that got in had been beforehand, but even that had one relatively obscure member (Bae). So yes, an existing presence is needed, but not a particularly substantial one.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1096.1</strong> —–2023-02-09 06:16:53+08:00:</p>

<p>So, there are any number of perspectives on this, but to lay out my <em>own</em> position, informed by my familiarity primarily with Qing scholarship, it is better to conceive of imperial China as comprising a contiguous set of political traditions claimed by a variety of non-consecutive states, rather than as a singular polity whose mantle passed between ruling families.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious case to consider is, what happens when there is more than one empire at the same time? Because to be quite frank, there has almost never been a Chinese empire where power simply passed from one ruling house to another at the top. ‘Civil’ wars, or perhaps more accurately wars of imperial competition, were the norm rather than the exception; virtually never was there a peaceful transition of power between dynastic houses, with perhaps the only notable exception being the Sima clan’s usurpation of the state of Wei from the Cao family to found the state of Jin in 265 CE; even that was, however, effectively a bloodless coup coming at the tail end of a major civil war within Wei. Even seemingly ‘clean’ transitions involved the foundation of a new state outright, but new states didn’t necessarily emerge with ambitions of assuming hegemonic status. For instance, the state of Latter Jin was founded in 1618 and refounded as the Great Qing in 1636, but we don’t really know exactly when it began seriously intending to conquer the lands of the Ming Empire. For its part, the Ming Empire never assumed the full territorial scope of the Yuan, which in any event <em>did not simply end in 1368</em>. The Northern Yuan continued, albeit in an increasingly ceremonial capacity, until the surrender of Lighdan Khan to the Jurchens in 1634.</p>

<p>To give an example of how empires overlapped temporally, the Qing conquest of the former Ming Empire actually serves as quite a good example. The Great Qing was, as noted above, founded in 1636. But at this juncture it only ruled over Manchuria, and not China proper. Its first permanent control of China proper came in 1644, when a rebel army besieged and captured Beijing, leading in turn to Qing forces being invited into China by Ming a frontier general, Wu Sangui, who defected to the Manchus. But if 1644 did not mark the beginning of the Qing Empire itself, neither did it mark the start of total Qing control of China: the completion of conquest was still more than a decade away. Nor did it mark the end of the Ming Empire, as branch lines of the Zhu clan declared a continued Ming Empire in southern China. The Qing would not stamp these remnants out in continental Asia until 1662, but that same year loyalist elements expelled the Dutch from Taiwan, leaving a Ming remnant across the strait. Formal control over southern China was delegated to three ‘feudatory’ states after 1655, but abolished in 1681 the wake of a revolt by these feudatories in the 1670s. Not until 1683 would the Ming loyalist remnants on Taiwan be stamped out.</p>

<p>So, if we were to use the ‘continuous empire’ model, at which of these junctures do we consider the Ming to have ended and the Qing to have begun?</p>

<ul>
  <li>1636? But the Qing had yet to conquer <em>any</em> of China, which was still in Ming hands, however tenuously.</li>
  <li>1644? But there was still a Ming emperor (well, at least three competing ones) ruling over territory the Qing didn’t yet control. Moreover, there was the rival Shun Empire, founded by the rebels who had dethroned the core Ming line that year.</li>
  <li>1662? But the Qing had yet to administratively integrate the south, nor deal with the last Ming remnants.</li>
  <li>1683? But this is just the reverse of the 1636 case – the Ming remnants on Taiwan hadn’t meaningfully contested Qing rule over China anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>The answer is that it is a trick question. We should not use the ‘continuous empire’ model. That being said, imperial transitions still did happen at the <em>local</em> level. We <em>can</em> give dates for when one region passed from one empire to another. For instance, if you were to visit a museum on Taiwan today, typically Ming reign dates are used up to the Qing conquest <em>of Taiwan</em> in 1683, rather than switching over in 1644 per the traditional, arbitrary chronology which uses the capture of Beijing as the transitional point. As far as the modern Taiwanese are concerned, the Ming-Qing transition, in chronological terms, is marked in terms of a <em>local</em> transition of power, not an abstract shift in the rulership of ‘China’. And how would we speak of regions that were not consistently part of a ‘canonical’ empire? Is the history of Xinjiang part of Chinese history in general, or just between 60-220, 640-763, and from 1757 onward? Is the history of Yunnan ‘Chinese’ history, or only after 1253?</p>

<p>The ‘continuous empire’ model breaks down further in scenarios where the ‘new’ state didn’t actually manage to fully ‘unite’ China, however defined. We have seen how the Ming didn’t actually conquer the Yuan outright, just displace it from China proper. But going back in time, the Song Empire, which united most of China by 960, failed to conquer what are now Hebei and Liaodong from the Khitan-ruled Great Liao, but despite the relatively limited territory the Liao held, this was enough to be a substantial hamper to Song prestige claims. This was further compounded when the Jurchen-ruled Jin state defeated the Liao and then conquered China up to the Huai River. So, who is ‘China’ in this instance? Classically, the traditional timeline of succession regards the Song as the legitimate successor to the Tang and completely sidelines the Liao and Jin, but that designation is completely arbitrary.</p>

<p>But not only did these periods represent a time of political division, there’s also a strong case to be made that prolonged non-Han rule in the north was beginning to cause an ethnographic divide. The Song, Liao, and Jin all had somewhat different language to describe their own Sinitic subjects versus those in their rival state, and this administrative division may – though we do not know with certainty – have had effects on self-identification. This division continued under the Yuan, who designated people as <em>Hanren</em> or <em>Songren</em> depending on whether they or their male-line ancestors were subjects of the Jin or the Song at the time of conquest. Had the eventual Red Turban revolt that established the Ming failed to push far enough north, or had the emperor they installed been less totalising in his intent to ‘de-Mongolify’ China following his victory, we may well have ended up with a permanent bifurcation of the Han Chinese into two separate population groups, which may conceivably have ended up with divergent histories of statehood. The assertion of Song legitimacy is one that really only makes sense from the retrospective view of the unified rule of China by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Empires, and the consolidation of China proper as both a geographical and a demographic space under the latter two empires.</p>

<p>Even then, relics of that political division survive in modern English. The term ‘Cathay’, which derives from ‘Khitai’, originally referred specifically to <em>northern</em> China, i.e. the former Jin lands, while ‘China’, coined by Marco Polo, referred solely to the south that had been ruled by the Song. While near-synonymous today, there was nevertheless a time when European outsiders, based on accurate information about China’s administration under the Yuan, regarded the north-south division as a natural one, temporarily bridged by Mongolian imperialism. Such north-south divides threatened to recur afterward, especially under the Qing: the Three Feudatories revolt of the 1670s, the Taiping War in the 1850s-60s, and the 1911 Revolution, all threatened to once again split China between a Han-ruled south and a non-Han-ruled north, should neither side have succeeded in achieving total victory.</p>

<p>Finally we just need to talk about the nomenclature here. There is no Chinese word that maps onto the same variety of meanings encompassed by the English word ‘China’; or, to put it another way, the English word ‘China’ is used to encompass a variety of meanings that exist as individual terms in Chinese, if they even do at all. Paradoxically, this flexibility is at times deliberately reabsorbed and appropriated by the more nationalistic strand of Chinese historians to argue that if a particular empire had <em>a</em> concept of a ‘China’ in some way, that it must therefore have been the <em>same</em> concept of China as used today. But even the term <em>Zhongguo</em> 中國, the closest analogue to ‘China’ that exists in Chinese, has had a variety of meanings over time. When first coined in the Warring States period, it was a plural meaning ‘the central state<strong>s</strong>’ that referred to the collective of the states that nominally recognised Zhou hegemony, or it was used in the singular to refer specifically to the Zhou as the nominal hegemon. Sometimes it was used to refer to a space defined by cultural cachet, at others to state boundaries. The Ming would use <em>Zhongguo</em> to denote a geographical region that we might term ‘China proper’, while excluding their outer imperial holdings, but the Qing used it more generally to refer to all of the territory under their rule. These are all different uses of the term <em>Zhongguo</em>, and its reuse over time is not in itself fundamentally convincing as to state continuity, especially when not all states agreed on what territory the term encompassed. Indeed, one thing to note is that the use of <em>Zhongguo</em> to describe the whole territory of a state may well be a Manchu calque: <em>dulimba-i gurun</em>, ‘central polity’, is a term with distinct Khitan and Jurchen precedents, and may have influenced <em>Zhongguo</em> rather than the other way around. Moreover, that these states did <em>not</em> simply reuse a shared term for their own territorial scope is indicative of the genuine notion that these were different empires. Empires with some shared political traditions, and overlapping territory, but nevertheless different.</p>

<p>There’s absolutely a strand of ‘unificationist’ thinking in Chinese grand strategy, but the thing is, there was never a consistent geographical definition of what ‘China’ one was supposed to ‘unify’. In practice, this was usually <em>suspiciously</em> similar to the land encompassed by the empire claiming to have achieved ‘unification’, irrespective of additional conquests or missing breakaway regions. The Song did indeed fail to fully ‘unify’ China’s cultural space, but their policies of ethnographic classification that I mention in the above answer fall into a general pattern of essentialising ‘China’ into the lands of the Song Empire to the exclusion of their allegedly ‘lost’ territory; the Ming were arguably huffing from the same bottle of copium when they gave up on military interventionism in the steppe and built the Great Wall, or when they were forced out of Vietnam. In this regard, the PRC is actually relatively unusual – although the timescale is still a bit shorter – in that it has not dropped its irredentist claims to Taiwan.</p>

For instance, Rome is thus a part of British history in a way that it isn’t for Chinese history; imperial China is a part of Chinese history in a way that it isn’t for, say, French or German history. I would also note, drawing from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wohtte/why_isnt_the_taiping_rebellion_more_well_known/ikcm7vb/?context=999">this answer</a>, that <strong>importance</strong> and <strong>scale</strong> ought not to be conflated. It is entirely reasonable to say, for instance, that the American Civil War was more important <em>to America</em> than the Taiping War, despite the disparity in mortality; indeed, I would allow that it may even have been more important globally than the Taiping War because of the place of the United States in the global networks of the time and the extent to which the war disrupted that place.</p>

<p>So this isn’t exactly what you’re asking about, but if you’re a hardcore canonicity and continuity obsessive, then <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> has partly demystified and partly re-complicated one of the most beloved episodes of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. DS9 stuff is not spoilered, SNW stuff is.</p>

<p>In the DS9 episode ‘Far Beyond the Stars’, Captain Sisko finds himself suddenly transplanted to 1950s New York as one Benny Russell, a middle-aged writer of science fiction working at the magazine <em>Incredible Tales</em>. He has run-ins with various coworkers and locals played by the same actors as the main cast of the show, but obviously playing different characters. Through the first part of the episode, Russell works on finishing the manuscript for his magnum opus, <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. While his coworkers love the story, the publisher refuses to print it because it depicts the captain as a Black man like himself, despite his best efforts to convince them otherwise. He breaks down and is carted off to a mental hospital, and suddenly wakes up again as Benjamin Sisko on the station. The episode ends with Sisko looking into the window, at a reflection of Benny Russell.</p>

<p>The question of what it all means has been an old one, but the simplest theory was that this was simply a vision granted by the Prophets. The Prophets, who orchestrated Sisko’s birth by possessing his mother, are a race of aliens residing inside a wormhole who have no concept of linear time, but who have substantial powers to alter reality and especially to cause visions of the past, the future, and alternate presents. On the surface, at least, ‘it was a metaphorical vision’ seems to be the most reasonable read. But although sometimes the Prophets create visions that are pure metaphor, but in other instances they appear to put people in the role of a different, actual person, <em>Quantum Leap</em>-style, and so the idea that Benny Russell was a real person in-universe, or that DS9 <em>is</em> something he dreamed up, cannot be discounted. But, that being a particularly standalone DS9 episode, the mystery remained.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>!In the <em>Strange New Worlds</em> episode ‘The Elysian Kingdom’, Dr M’Benga has a storybook that he reads to his fatally ill daughter, Rukiya, during the periods when it is safe for her to be taken out of transporter stasis. This book, <em>The Kingdom of Elysian</em>, is a fantasy story about the adventures of King Ridley and his court. The episode sees a powerful consciousness, nicknamed ‘Debra’, reach into Rukiya’s imagination and recreate the story using the members of the <em>Enterprise</em> crew, casting M’Benga (who, along with the chief engineer, Hemmer, is one of the only people not to have had his mind overridden by the story) as King Ridley. What actually happens in the episode besides that is immaterial, because, in the handful of closeups we get to see of the book, we see the name of its author: Benny Russell.!&lt;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>!So now, if you are of the opinion that everything must be reconcilable, we now have some critical questions: did Benny Russell <em>actually exist</em>? And if so, did the manuscript of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>? Does <em>Strange New Worlds</em> take place in a timeline in which DS9 won’t? Or did the Prophets do some time travel shenanigans where they manipulated the <em>Deep Space Nine</em> manuscript into existence only <em>after</em> they had encountered the station? In answering one question, <em>so many more</em> have been raised!!&lt;</p>

<p>The word you’re looking for is ‘syllabary’ – a script in which characters map onto syllables rather than individual vowels and consonants.</p>

<p>I’ll also add something I blanked on earlier (and tagging in /u/Xmgplays as well) – ん is pronounced /m/ when it precedes a m-, p-, or b- consonant. As such, コンプレックス could still be pronounced <em>kompureksu</em> even though it is spelled ‘konpureksu’. When the ‘plex’ part of ‘complex’ is taken out, however, you are left with コン <em>kon</em>, with no subsequent m-/p-/b- consonant to make it a /m/ sound. If ‘com’ were being loaned, then コム <em>komu</em> would indeed make more sense, but this is an abbreviation of a loan, like サンドイッチ <em>sandoicchi</em> becoming shortened to サンド <em>sando</em>, or, more pertinently, ‘personal computer’ being abbreviated to パソコン <em>pasokon</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>EnclavedMicrostate</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ForeignAffairsMag在2023-02-06~2023-02-12的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-11/ForeignAffairsMag/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ForeignAffairsMag在2023-02-06~2023-02-12的言论" /><published>2023-02-11T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-11T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-11/ForeignAffairsMag</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-11/ForeignAffairsMag/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>346.1</strong> —–2023-02-06 22:51:21+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Kristin Ven Bruusgaard:</strong> Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, there has been a near-constant debate about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear arsenal—and what he might do with it. The United States has repeatedly warned that a flustered Russia may actually be willing to use nuclear weapons, and the Kremlin itself has regularly raised the specter of a nuclear strike. According to top U.S. officials, senior Russian military leaders have discussed when and under what circumstances they might employ nuclear weapons. The concerns have even prompted states close to Russia, notably China, to warn Moscow against going nuclear.</p>

<p>The ultimate weapon has, of course, not been employed in this conflict, and one hopes that it never will be. The world may never know to what extent Russian leaders considered it a real option or whether it was Western signaling that persuaded Moscow not to make such a drastic choice. But as long as tensions remain high between Russia and NATO, the possibility of a nuclear war persists, and U.S. and European leaders must consider how to prevent the Kremlin from using its missiles. To do this, they must understand the protocols that govern Russia’s nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Political leaders in all nuclear-armed states have to balance two competing imperatives: ensuring that their weapons can never be used without proper authorization and keeping the weapons in a state of constant readiness. They solve this dilemma in different ways, designing idiosyncratic command-and-control systems that affect nuclear decision-making. In the case of Russia, the process for commanding the use of nuclear weapons requires the sign-off of multiple officials, unlike the system in the United States, where the commander in chief has full latitude. That said, the Russian military has a disproportionate impact on nuclear policy; there are few outside analysts who can sway the Kremlin’s decisions on nuclear weapons. And although the system by which nuclear commands are issued is strictly centralized in Russia, the command and control of low-yield—or so-called tactical—nuclear weapons creates particular challenges for Western policymakers seeking to prevent Russian nuclear use.</p>

<p>These challenges make it more difficult for Western policymakers to know whether Moscow has ordered a nuclear launch or whether it is engaging in mere signaling, and to formulate policies that would mitigate an actual strike. But given Moscow’s protocols, the West should pay attention not only to Putin but also to Russia’s military leaders when thinking about Russia’s nuclear weapons. The West should also convey the significant risks and costs increased nuclear signaling—and actual use—entails in order to deter Russia. Ultimately, the ambiguity of Russia’s doctrine and protocols means that nuclear use would create a deeply dangerous situation that neither side may be able to control.</p>

<p><strong>From Daniel Byman:</strong> “In November 2022, the United Nations warned that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was “again reaching a boiling point.” Amit Saar, a top Israeli intelligence official, predicted that violence in the West Bank (although not Gaza) will rank as Israel’s second biggest challenge in 2023, just below the perennial threat from Iran. Saar warned not only that violence was increasing but also that the foundations for managing it were becoming “unstable.” The policing capacity of the Palestinian Authority, the governing body in the West Bank, and its relationship with Israel are eroding. No political process holds the promise of Palestinian independence. And ordinary Palestinians are growing frustrated with established groups and leaders that reject violence—such as Fatah, the party that has long dominated Palestinian politics, and its head, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the PA. In yet another foreboding development, in December 2022, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created a new government that put settlers, political extremists, and racists in key positions overseeing the West Bank. All this leads to a despairing, inescapable conclusion: the odds of a third intifada are higher than they have been in years.”</p>

<p>—– <strong>349.1</strong> —–2023-02-09 00:02:16+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Dara Massicot:</strong> Three months before Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, CIA Director William Burns and U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan met in Moscow with Nikolai Patrushev, an ultra-hawkish adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Burns and Sullivan informed Patrushev that they knew of Russia’s invasion plans and that the West would respond with severe consequences if Russia proceeded. According to Burns, Patrushev said nothing about the invasion. Instead, he looked them in the eye, conveying what Burns took as a message: the Russian military could achieve what it wanted.</p>

<p>Once home, the two Americans informed U.S. President Joe Biden that Moscow had made up its mind. Not long after, Washington began publicly warning the world that Russia would attack Ukraine. Three months ahead of the invasion, the Kremlin knew that the United States had discovered its war plans and that the world would be primed for an assault—yet Putin decided to deny his intentions to Russia’s own troops and most of its senior leaders. They did not learn of the invasion until several days or even hours before it began. The secrecy was a mistake. By orchestrating the attack with just a small group of advisers, Putin undercut many of the advantages his country should have had.</p>

<p>These strengths were substantial. Before the invasion, Russia’s military was larger and better equipped than Ukraine’s. Its forces had more combat experience than did Kyiv’s, even though both had fought in Ukraine’s eastern territories. Most Western analysts therefore assumed that if Russian forces used their advantages wisely, the Ukrainians could not withstand the attack for long.</p>

<p>Why Russia did not prevail—why it was instead stopped in its tracks, routed outside major cities, and put on the defensive—has become one of the most important questions in both U.S. foreign policy and international security more broadly. The answer has many components. The excessive internal secrecy gave troops and commanders little time to prepare, leading to heavy losses. Russia created an invasion plan that was riddled with faulty assumptions, arbitrary political guidance, and planning errors that departed from key Russian military principles. The initial invasion called for multiple lines of attack with no follow-on force, tethering the military to operational objectives that were overly ambitious for the size of its forces. And the Kremlin erroneously believed that its war plans were sound, that Ukraine would not put up much resistance, and that the West’s support would not be strong enough to make a difference. As a result, Russia was shocked when its troops ran into a determined Ukraine backed by Western intelligence and weapons. Russian forces were then repeatedly beaten.</p>

<p>—– <strong>350.1</strong> —–2023-02-10 04:21:49+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Shivshankar Menon:</strong> For the past year, many Western analysts have regarded the war in Ukraine as marking a turning point in geopolitics, bringing together not only the United States and its NATO allies but also a broader liberal coalition to counter Russian aggression. In this view, countries around the world should naturally support the West in this defining contest between democracy and autocracy.</p>

<p>Beyond the borders of North America and Europe, however, the past 12 months have looked very different. At the outset of the war, numerous countries in the global South identified with neither the West nor Russia. Several dozen—including such large democracies as India, Indonesia, and South Africa, as well as numerous other countries in Africa—abstained from resolutions condemning Russia at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council. Many of them have also been reluctant to formally adopt the West’s economic sanctions against Russia while respecting them in practice, and as the war has unfolded, some of them have sought to maintain relations with Russia as much as with the West.</p>

<p>Moreover, in many parts of the world, the most crucial issues of 2022 had little to do with the war in Ukraine. Emerging from the havoc of the pandemic and confronted by far-reaching challenges ranging from debt crises to a slowing world economy to climate change, many developing countries have been alienated by what they view as the self-absorption of the West and of China and Russia. For them, the war in Ukraine is about the future of Europe, not the future of the world order, and the war has become a distraction from the more pressing global issues of our time.</p>

<p>Yet despite this disillusionment, a coherent third way, a clear alternative to current great-power rivalry, has yet to emerge. Instead, these countries have sought to work with present realities, respecting Western sanctions on Russia, for instance, in an international system that no longer inspires much faith in its relevance to their security and economic concerns. In this sense, for many parts of the globe, a year of war in Ukraine has done less to redefine the world order than to set it further adrift, raising new questions about how urgent transnational challenges can be met.</p>

<p>—– <strong>351.1</strong> —–2023-02-11 04:40:31+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong> When Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, he was confident that this new assault on the rules-based international order would not be met with serious pushback—and with good reason. For more than a decade, Putin had gotten away with this type of aggressive behavior. From land grabs in Georgia and Ukraine to war crimes in Syria, from interference in other countries’ domestic politics to murder within and outside Russia’s borders, his list of crimes was long, but Putin never paid a substantial political or economic price for his offenses.</p>

<p>Putin learned this lesson after invading Georgia in 2008. Russia’s goal was to overthrow the democratically elected government of Mikheil Saakashvili and install a puppet regime. It was the first time since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 that Moscow had invaded another country. Georgian resistance and Western support helped stop Russia from establishing full control over the country, but after a five-day war, Moscow still managed to seize territory from Tbilisi. Despite this, the West did not make Russia pay for violating another country’s sovereignty when the war was over. No economic or political sanctions against Russia followed. Instead, the United States and its allies soon looked for ways to reset their policies with the Kremlin, hoping to improve relations in the service of other goals. Yet accommodation only encouraged Putin to further harass Russia’s neighbors, repress his people, and undermine security and stability in Europe.</p>

<p>For now, the goals in Ukraine are to stop Putin from destroying the country and to restore its territorial integrity. But this war will one day come to an end, and at that point, the West will need to decide how to deal with a postwar Russia. The West cannot forget the lessons of Georgia: it must remember the dangers of accommodating Putin or another Russian dictator. To avoid repeating its past mistakes, the West should first fully support Ukraine to win this war. It should grant NATO membership to Georgia and Ukraine. It should seek to liberate Russian-occupied territories in Georgia and Moldova by sustaining political and economic pressure on Russia and by supporting democracy and good governance in those countries. The United States and its allies should also develop an energy and transportation corridor that connects Central Asia with Europe, bypassing Russia. If the West takes these overdue steps, there is a chance for lasting peace, because Putin will finally pay a price for his wars.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spinkcat在2023-02-06~2023-02-12的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-09/Spinkcat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spinkcat在2023-02-06~2023-02-12的言论" /><published>2023-02-09T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-09/Spinkcat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-09/Spinkcat/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>转移支付本身概念没问题，有问题的是配套措施。</p>

<p>中共的转移支付逻辑，不是通过转移支付手段把贫穷地区在无外部资源输入的情况下扶持起来。</p>

<p>而是吊着他们有口气喘就行，甚至会借转移支付限制某些有潜力的地区脱离他们认为的地位自行发展。</p>

<p>再有就是转移支付的背景，是禁止人口自由流动，无法通过所在地纳税享有全国性基本公共服务为前提，变相把人与土地绑死，这种情况下被迫用转移支付吊着一口气给出不来也无法改变自身的穷困省份人口。</p>

<p>合理的转移支付，应该是在允许人口流动的前提下，该地区无外部资源自行建设，政府承担一个投资者角色去建设当地，为地方提供启动资金。</p>

<p>现在中共只是靠分税制收缴全国财权，他们认为你这个地方发展不起来，你可能需要100%的资金，但他只给你60%。</p>

<p>给没给钱？的确给了。</p>

<p>但是够不够启动发展的，不够。</p>

<p>也就是说并没有真正改善穷富省份有区别的核心问题，相反助长了这种情况发生。</p>

<p>又要绑住一大群人在当地，又不肯给足额的发展资金、政策，别说西部穷省了，东北这种基础底子强的，转移支付和配套政策实际都是限制当地发展。</p>

<p>其实不谈现在网上的各种印象，在老一代革命出身的人眼里，也提到了类似认知。</p>

<p>倒不是闭关锁国或别的什么的网上常见舆论，而是指清朝在洋务运动后，没有立刻转型放权，君主立宪一直拖延到非常晚期才做，进而导致革命党出现，人心惶惶后被迫改革，结果半途而废，直接导致权力真空，出现了长期的混乱。</p>

<p>清朝对后世的负面直接影响，主要来自于鸦片战争后，明明与日本同期进行改革，日本完成了全面转型，清廷内部保守派却一直在致力于拖延改革，哪怕满人内部出现过改革主义者，却也遭到了扑杀或排挤，导致清国十九世纪下半叶变成了“学其体而不用其骨”的局面。</p>

<p>一旦真正的改革需求到不可遏制时，既无法镇压重新走上改革道路，也无法从容妥协放权换取稳定。</p>

<p>反而是压一半，做一半，进退两难的情况下权力中枢崩溃。</p>

<p>可以说中国二十世纪上半叶的混乱，是清廷一手导致的，也让中国成为一个易于被日本盯上入侵的目标。</p>

<p>社会经济发展的同时，带来了大量资源。</p>

<p>而众所周知，相对落后的农业国更倾向于威权主义与社会。</p>

<p>这就导致从农业快速过渡到工业社会时（或工业社会往更高级形态发展时），社会的实际状况与制度出现不匹配的状况。</p>

<p>也就是说，制度对比社会意识形态的改变是有很强延迟性的，从历史角度来说几十年就是一刹那而已，非常短暂。</p>

<p>但是对一个人来讲就是一生，因而很容易被人误判为威权主义崛起是一种趋势。</p>

<p>而另一方面，威权主义也的确会随发展中国家经济增长而强势。</p>

<p>因为在社会形态过渡期间，有延迟性的制度，仍然由威权主义者控制。</p>

<p>威权主义者此时便可以利用社会高速发展的经济获取大量资源，从而在国际和国内获得更多话语权（比如习近平早期对外大规模借贷，亚投行到一带一路等，以及资金增加扩大对内控制）</p>

<p>但这些行为往往不产生经济效益，也不符合社会经济上发展规律，而观察者恰巧生存在这个时间点。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2007.3</strong> —–2023-02-20 09:31:00+08:00:</p>

<p>国内除了少数人外，多数人都是墙头草，风往哪吹就往哪倒，谁上台唱什么曲就听什么戏。</p>

<p>嘴上说不要现代民主，是因为权力没在自己手上，一旦把权往下放，他们万万不会再放手。</p>

<p>说白了，民众并不傻，但也没有主观改变的意愿，封闭环境里有什么就说什么，跟风摆而已，改革开放前那么多年计划经济，吃到好处就没人愿意回头，自由化放权符合现代社会发展的生产力需求，这种需求已经一定程度体现在社会各个方面。</p>

<p>苏联转型到俄罗斯，仍然有大量威权主义者，中国也无可避免。</p>

<p>也因此，新政权或者有志者，更应该团结意识形态与手腕，尽可能避免保守派换皮后建立一个不那么进步的威权政府，要比威权主义者更有现实感的推行自由化。</p>

<p>而苏联缺乏经济基础，没有现代化的产业与社会演化，这一点是中国与苏联不同的，中国走在资本主义道路上，社会的形态发展基本充分，苏联改制相当于日本二战刚结束后半死不活，中国则类似到了日本八九十年代前夕，发展到一定高度后，人的观念和社会的生产结构发生了不可逆的变化。</p>

<p>那么改制自由化的需求就更高更普遍，但因为人口过于庞大，也无可避免会出现保守主义者换皮上位的可能，这是最值得警惕的。</p>

<p>威权保守派狡猾残忍，推行自由化的人要比他们更狡猾决绝。</p>

<p>虽然历史趋势上，就算有一个威权政府上台，迟早也要回归到自由化路线，但是我们没有必要非等一辈子浪费时间，因此这一代人的主观行动就决定了下一代有多早能享受到更自由化的生活，我们也该在老龄化完全腐蚀社会前，尽早结束威权政府管控的旧社会，在未来全球竞争里尽早拿到一个好的位置。</p>

<p>至于刘仲敬说的四分五裂，跟小政府分权是不完全是一回事，那是他的个人政治主张，不具备现实实现的可能性。</p>

<p>回归小政府是社会生产结构带来的必然结果，因为社会太过庞大，政府并不是真正意义变小了，而是分权于各地，而非集中在一个大的中央政府手里。</p>

<p>因此“小政府”的描述在我看来不严谨，它实际上是一个平权政府，减少政府非必要开支与管控，因为一个要管理十几亿人所有事项的政府，必然是极其庞大和臃肿的，这只会带来效率问题，进而妨碍社会自行高效率运转。</p>

<p>中央政府职责更多应该是集中于全国性政策，而不是“因为是中央政府所以大小事务咸决于之”。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2007.4</strong> —–2023-02-20 09:59:43+08:00:</p>

<p>没必要，欧美发达国家也不是靠这种体制发展，威权只是延续农业时代社会底层运作逻辑的一种体现，过去的直接制度和阶级体现就是王权封建社会。</p>

<p>只不过共和化后，威权转型为独裁、专制，从个人到小圈子集体的区别，骨子里变化不大。</p>

<p>正确来讲，需要的是良好的治理，因为集中力量办事客观存在，但这是基于做的正确，而不是集中力量，只要做的正确了，资源倾斜集中力量在全球任何政府体制里都存在，与民主化无必然关系。</p>

<p>区别在于，一个社会利益持份者足够多时，假设你不通过对内获取合法性与支持，让集体有一个共识，一意孤行的施政只会带来社会撕裂。</p>

<p>因此会出现大量的反对者，对反对者又需要镇压，进而导致社会矛盾积聚，甚至走向内战，那么这种可能导致社会撕裂与内战的所谓集中力量办大事，是不是还有必要呢？</p>

<p>面对这个问题，专制集体要么是到时候放权，要么是留一条路出来，装硬汉到最后的，会让矛盾升级到不可调和，到时候就是身死族灭的大祸，并且留下一地鸡毛，让集权时不改革的弊病，直接无缓冲下坠到整个社会。</p>

<p>但反过来如果你得到了普遍支持，这种合法性对政策的推动也会远大于独裁专制下威权化压制社会反对声音得来的所谓“力量”。</p>

<p>一个议题，有充足数量的人反对时，就说明推广缺乏落实基础，但如果反对的人很少， 不足以形成大规模的矛盾，这个时候选举上台的政权其实是可以靠制度赋予的权力强行推行的。</p>

<p>也就是说，民选制度虽然考虑不同阶层利益，但也赋予了执政者一定程度的决定权，只不过如果社会后来认为这些政策不利于社会长期发展，下一任上台就会取消或者修改细节，比如经典的奥巴马医保就是靠制度优势强推，但共和党上台也不是说一味否定，只是认为社会有这个需要，但细节不该如此。</p>

<p>再者是，的确存在威权主义社会的普遍情况，因为很多人适应的就是威权主义，会天然地支持这种社会管理模式。</p>

<p>而反过来讲，宪政民主的本质，是一套适用于工业化精细分工的社会制度，只有当社会生产力的硬件水平有需求时，宪政民主制度才有市场。</p>

<p>因此生产力落后的农业国与半工业国，社会成员个体都是习惯于威权主义的生产模式，因为威权主义只能管理少数产业分工，而一个人价值观和技巧学习基本都在前半生成型，所以对新社会与制度普遍都是抵触的，也给了威权主义制度生存和“被需求的空间”。</p>

<p>新中国实际具备了宪政民主的基础，但仍然无法完全脱离威权主义，因为有数亿人口仍然从事农业生产，计划经济的推行其实就是源于习惯威权主义者的软弱性，以及政权拳头大双重作用下的结果。</p>

<p>是人都没法想象美国人会老实接受政府强加这种制度，国内少数脱离威权主义观念的人，在当时也是有很大抵触的，可并不足以形成一种反对浪潮，这就是大环境下多数人是被动的威权主义者的体现。</p>

<p>我们也都没听说过，有哪些个国家开始不可逆走向宪政民主化时，会有威权政府的威权主义支持者出来死节，也说明了威权主义本质是服从与被服从，人会自我驯化的一个体现而已，是不需要考虑持份者意见的。</p>

<p>所以新中国实行宪政民主，本质还是会回到威权主义道路上，但是会把这个曲折提前三四十年，首先宪政民主下就不可能强行推动计划经济，那就还是走改革开放的老路，社会的发展更早，自然也会更好。</p>

<p>虽然有威权主义的内核，这也是无可避免的。</p>

<p>但我们可以通过尽早发展经济，改变社会生产力的底层逻辑，来促使威权主义褪色，也是到当代社会正在发生的变革。</p>

<p>那么从这点看，前三十年大体上是没什么意义的垃圾时间，甚至反思都不彻底，现代的威权主义者仍然想走回老路。</p>

<p>到最后也就又涉及一个问题，威权主义者在面临放权的抉择时，要么放权换来和平的社会变革，要么就是坚决不放权，宁可为了维护自己利益也要拖整个社会与国家未来发展下水。</p>

<p>前者在全球各地是稀少的，后者却比比皆是，数不胜数。</p>

<p>由此可见，我们所处在什么样的一个环境和未来当中。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2007.5</strong> —–2023-02-21 19:37:28+08:00:</p>

<p>殖民目的是原材料，原材料能变现来自于技术与商业的进步，也就是生产力的进步。</p>

<p>就像非洲土著，有煤炭他们也没法变现，而殖民时代的兴起就是因为工业化开始后，许多有技术和商业需求的国家缺乏资源。</p>

<p>在殖民之前，这些资源没有任何技术和概念高效利用起来，殖民之后，殖民者为了维护设备与当地业务，会投入大量资源进行在地化建设，反而提供了利用资源的技术与认知。</p>

<p>也就是说，很多资源在殖民之前，对当地人来说是无甚作用。</p>

<p>但殖民掠夺现象是客观存在的，却不代表欧美国家是靠殖民掠夺发展起来，殖民仅仅是因为那个年代的国际和对内政治道德允许他们这样做，就跟古人童婚一样。</p>

<p>有趣的地方是，正因为殖民行为才赋予了许多殖民地资源价值，让这些殖民地开始现代化。</p>

<p>伴随殖民地时代的结束，其中一个主要原因就是殖民不如购买，到十九世纪末期，许多地方更愿意发展势力范围组成关税区，到一二战后干脆殖民地模式彻底没落。</p>

<p>从殖民地掠夺如果说是获取原材料，那么必须要有一个消费对象才行，否则就会造成过剩，而一个国家本土人口有限，因此后来对外贸易，或者说培育能进行贸易的对象，反而是许多老牌工业国家的常态。</p>

<p>无论对内还是对外殖民，许多国家都做过，但是为什么清朝靠压榨内部也发展不起来，这一点其实已经说明，所谓的殖民掠夺说法站不住脚。</p>

<p>单纯靠殖民掠夺来发展这种论调，是默认全世界的资源与财富是等价的，只需要欧美殖民者到处靠枪杆子搬运，就能持续赋予发展几百年，跟现在说美国靠美军维护美元和控制石油一样。</p>

<p>完全忽略了美元强势的基础，根本原因是美国的产业和庞大的消费市场，是个既生产全球种类最全也最广泛，还有全球最大和单体力度消费最高的市场。</p>

<p>美元就像一张在该市场的兑换券，你进入该最大市场持券能购买和消费，包括其他进入该市场的国家，你也可以场外靠这个与他们贸易，然后他们也能重新到美国市场贸易，这是美元的核心强势基础。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2007.6</strong> —–2023-02-22 04:39:02+08:00:</p>

<p>部分，但绝大部分殖民地消费不起这些工业国的产品。（或不足以承担全部消费需求）</p>

<p>以鸦片战争为例，同时期清朝对外顺差，因为社会形态差异过大，虽然英国方面认为是个庞大的市场，但中国自耕农是消费不起欧洲工业产品的。</p>

<p>中国通过压低人均生活水平和阻断技术生产力的应用，将平民消费与收入水平压到非常低的程度，无法消费进阶工业品，导致双方贸易期间的货币结构出问题，交易媒介越来越少，成本也在提高。</p>

<p>英国也有通过发展殖民地的方法，把殖民地人口利用起来，发展了海外市场，典型的如英国的纺织工业。</p>

<p>包括银矿在内，单独靠欧洲的银矿是不足以让欧陆各国与中国进行长期的大宗商品贸易，南美洲等欧陆国家殖民地独立后，这些产银地的丢失，让英国以外的国家都退出了与中国贸易。</p>

<p>唯独英国靠掌握印度棉花的原材料生产，能对中国进行大规模的出口，从而形成一定程度的贸易平衡。</p>

<p>但是中国的地生活水平与庞大领土，本土也生产了相当多原材料，在缺乏远距离运输技术的情况下，进口产品不像现在一样容易覆盖到全国。</p>

<p>最后出现供过于求，中国市场根本没能力消化大量棉花，贸易平衡再次被打断。</p>

<p>中国方面的行商制，卡死了外部商贸进入中国的可能性，都要通过这道关卡，而得到许可的行商内部往往串联形成垄断，进一步压低了在华贸易的价值。</p>

<p>也就是说，社会形态差异太大，日用品难以被输入，输入后被抽高关税且平民无法消费，庞大的市场就无从谈起，最后这种贸易平衡需求就落到了少数奢侈品上。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-02-06~2023-02-12的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-08/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-02-06~2023-02-12的言论" /><published>2023-02-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-08/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-08/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>This one hits very close to home for me.  I grew up at a time when being gay meant you might wind up at such a facility.  I never had that experience.  But I knew several who did, one of which was a close friend of mine in high school.</p>

<p>The people who run these facilities are evil.  And I have no sympathy whatsoever for the parents who put their kids into the hands of those monsters.</p>

<p>I can’t speak to your experience, and won’t express an opinion on it.  But the whole “we did the best we could” and “we were lied to” and “they deceived us” lines hold no weight with me.</p>

<p>If you’re making a decision about the welfare of your kid, you have a responsibility to do a minimally adequate level of diligence.</p>

<p>And ANY level of due diligence would usually have revealed those “facilities” for what they were.</p>

<p>In the case of a once close friend of mine, his parents turned a blind eye.  They didn’t see because they didn’t want to see.  They ignored their kid (my friend) because they chose to disregard the clear signs for help they were receiving — months after he was suffering through their “treatment.”</p>

<p>His parents will answer for their decisions in hell, as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<p>I disagree, but you’re an education major and do not appear to be pursuing, or have obtained, a terminal degree, so the reasons why aren’t likely to make sense for you.</p>

<p>In the United States, when you’re in graduate school pursuing a terminal degree, particularly something of value (e.g., STEM field, something quantitative-focused and the like), there is a financial value that attaches to the labor involved in <em>your</em> actually teaching undergraduate students.</p>

<p>There is also some financial value associated with doing that in worthless fields (e.g., women’s studies, sociology or history), but it’s nominal.</p>

<p>The financial value that’s on the line is, at the very least, all the money a college/university didn’t have to pay someone with a terminal degree for those hours providing instruction.</p>

<p>It turns out universities/colleges really like to have their graduate students teach courses like that, or do all the heavy lifting involved with teaching such a course, because the university is always financially better off in that case.</p>

<p>For example, if an actual professor who can secure grants is spending time teaching undergrads, the university isn’t benefiting from the grant money he might secure if his time was spent doing those things.</p>

<p>Likewise, if an actual professor who can generate “elitist cred” (e.g., writing papers that get cited by literally everyone in the field doing anything that matters), or contributing to the research underlying such a paper, then the professor is increasing the probability of the university’s receiving future grants or other monies.</p>

<p>That means teaching undergraduates is a lesser priority (if any priority at all), because this is about money for university administration.  Maybe the graduate students get enough money in the form of a stipend so that they can just barely afford not to starve.  Maybe not.  But the University President is going to make 750k/yr (or probably more) for doing nothing other than wining and dining the rich and powerful alums, to get more money for . . . whatever money can be used for.</p>

<p>What you likely do not understand, and are probably intellectually incapable of accepting, is that the more time a professor (or any relevant actor) spends teaching a course, the less better off he is, his department is, the president of the university is and everyone in university administration.</p>

<p>So that means that students are a lesser priority.  Many of them want to learn, but the reality is that at a certain level of university (where I am sure you are not presently attending, otherwise you might have gathered some sense of this) most of the students could teach themselves and only really required some guidance as to where to focus their efforts.</p>

<p>The rouse is that you’re there to learn stuff about things.  The reality is that you are a mere inconvenience to the pursuit of financial gain, that is still somewhat necessary to justify the university’s existence.  And you pay them for the privilege, in exchange for a degree signifying that you attended and maybe learned something.  Although if you’re majoring in education, it seems fairly unlikely you learned anything other than how to do let a frat boy take Jello shots off of various parts of your body while playing beer pong.</p>

<p>Unless you’re one of the woke types, in which case you not only learned nothing but you likely had no fun in the process of incurring more than a hundred thousand dollars of student debt in exchange for a piece of paper that signifies you made poor life choices.</p>

<p>Indeed, a racket by definition.  And you’ve just heard from a ghost in the machine.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong>: “Western leaders need to shift how they approach the Ukraine conflict. At this stage, incrementally expanding military and economic assistance is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely. Instead, in 2023, the United States, NATO, and the democratic world more broadly should aim to support a breakthrough. This means more advanced weapons, more sanctions against Russia, and more economic aid to Ukraine. None of this should be doled out incrementally. It needs to be provided swiftly, so that Ukraine can win decisively on the battlefield this year. Without greater and immediate support, the war will settle into a stalemate, which is only to Putin’s advantage. In the end, the West will be judged by what happened during the last year of the war, not by what happened in the first.”</p>

<p>—– <strong>342.1</strong> —–2023-02-02 00:45:43+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong> “In the late Soviet era, only twice did Moscow’s military interrupt the daily lives of ordinary citizens. The first occasion was the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which went largely unnoticed by many Russians because few knew what was going on. The second was the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which had far greater consequences. For many people, the sight of zinc coffins being flown back from a distant southern country, even as Marxism-Leninism was losing currency at home, shattered the moral foundations of the Soviet project.</p>

<p>In 2022, Moscow’s military once again interrupted the lives of ordinary citizens with an invasion, and the result has been even worse than either of those previous events: Russia has just lived through the most terrifying year in post-Soviet history. Yet despite growing loss of life and stark moral defeats, there has been no shattering of national foundations. Sure, Russians are becoming divided, and their opinions polarized, as people grow tired of war. But far from weakening Putin’s hold on power, the ‘special military operation’ has only strengthened it.</p>

<p>Those who fear Putin have either fled the country or are silent. The regime has a formidable arsenal of instruments to deploy against anyone who speaks out or otherwise expresses opposition. It has used the legal system to crush any dissent, handing down Stalinist prison terms to antiwar activists. It has invented its own equivalent of yellow stars to harass, threaten, and intimidate those deemed ‘foreign agents.’ (I had the honor of receiving such a designation in late December.) It has closed down or blocked access to virtually all independent media. And it has pinned the unofficial label of “national traitor” on anyone who does not express delight at the state’s ramping up of repression, the war, and the increasingly personal military-police-state regime that is driving it.</p>

<p>And so, instead of protesting, most Russians have made clear that they prefer to adapt. Even fleeing the country is not necessarily a form of protest: for many, it is simply a pragmatic answer to the problem of how to avoid being killed or becoming a killer. It is true that the population is more anxious than ever. According to opinion surveys, anxiety among Russians reached new heights in 2022, although it returned to more or less tolerable levels when the threat of mobilization temporarily receded. But adaptation has become the overriding Russian trait. Where will it end? For the moment, it seems that there is no limit.”</p>

<p>—– <strong>343.1</strong> —–2023-02-02 22:20:16+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong> For much of last year, while the idea of liberating Crimea remained academic, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was willing to set aside the question of the region’s near-term status. Ukrainian forces were focused on liberating occupied territory outside the peninsula, and the future of Crimea seemed likely to be determined after the end of the war through diplomatic negotiations. But as the war has progressed and Ukraine has liberated large swaths of its territory from occupying Russian forces, Zelensky’s rhetoric regarding Crimea has shifted. “Crimea is our land, our territory,” he said last month in a video appeal to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “Give us your weapons,” he urged, and Ukraine will retake “what is ours.” And according to The New York Times, the Biden administration has begun to come around to the idea that Ukraine may need to threaten Russia’s foothold on the peninsula to strengthen its negotiating position, even at the risk of escalating the conflict.</p>

<p>If earnest negotiations were to start soon, Zelensky might still be open to a deal that ended the war and deferred the question of Crimea to a later date. But if the fighting drags on through the spring and summer and Ukraine inflicts enormous casualties on Russia while liberating substantial territory, it will become increasingly difficult for Zelensky to grant Putin a face-saving exit from the war and permit Russia’s continued but temporary occupation of Crimea. By the summer, Ukraine is likely to begin targeting more of Russia’s military infrastructure in Crimea in preparation for a broader campaign to liberate the peninsula. Instead of waiting for this scenario to play out, risking a longer and more dangerous war that could embroil NATO, Washington should give Ukraine the weapons and assistance it needs to win quickly and decisively in all occupied territories north of Crimea—and to credibly threaten to take the peninsula militarily.</p>

<p>Doing so would force Putin to the negotiating table and create an opening for diplomatic talks while the final status of Crimea remains unsettled, offering Putin a path out of Ukraine that doesn’t guarantee his political demise and allowing Ukraine to avoid an enormously costly military campaign that is by no means guaranteed to succeed. The eventual deal would require an immediate reduction of Russian conventional forces on the peninsula and outline a path to a referendum allowing the people of Crimea, including those displaced after the 2014 invasion, to determine the final status of the region.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong> “The Islamic Republic is now a hollow misnomer. It is a theocracy that has inadvertently secularized the population. It is a republic that has demolished the participatory base it once used to legitimize its rule. By gradually tightening his circle of insiders, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has sidelined an increasing number of the original revolutionaries and other politicians who sought to put the system on a better path. Khamenei elevated sycophants over skilled experts and loyalists over loyal critics, prompting a crisis of competence that has brought the country to the brink of socioeconomic and environmental disaster. There is no one left with political heft, acumen, or gravitas to deliver hard truths to Khamenei, who will soon turn 84.”</p>

<p>—– <strong>345.1</strong> —–2023-02-04 00:10:18+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Henri Barkey:</strong> In a year that has brought renewed strength and unity to NATO, perhaps no country has proven more confounding to the alliance than Turkey. For other NATO members, Russia’s war in Ukraine has brought new resolve against a common enemy and paved the way for the alliance’s expansion. Yet Turkey, though it is a NATO member, has not only maintained cordial relations with Russia; it has also threatened to block the NATO candidacies of Sweden and Finland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Turkish government has suggested it might start a new land invasion of northern Syria to take on the United States’ Syrian Kurdish allies, who operate in that area. And even as Turkey repairs strained ties with many Middle Eastern powers, it has continued to have chilly relations with the European Union and has made new threats toward Greece. Perhaps most unexpectedly, after years of seeking to undermine Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Ankara has begun a rapprochement with the regime in Damascus, mediated by Russia.</p>

<p>These moves, though controversial in the West, are generally popular in Turkey. They also have a clear purpose. In May, Turkey’s longtime populist-authoritarian ruler, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will face what will likely be the toughest reelection bid of his political career, and foreign policy has become an effective way to distract voters from multiple crises at home. After years of economic mismanagement, Turkey’s inflation rate peaked at 85 percent in November 2022, declining somewhat to 64 percent in December. This is by far the highest rate in Europe, easily surpassing runner-up Hungary with its 25 percent. Turkey’s foreign exchange reserves are dwindling, and the nation faces a burgeoning current-account deficit. The Turkish population is increasingly disgruntled by the presence of 3.6 million Syrian refugees, which Turkey, to its credit, admitted at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War. There is also growing fatigue with Erdogan’s increasingly autocratic 20-year rule; a whole generation has known no other leader.</p>

<p>For Erdogan, everything is now riding on the elections. After 20 years of largely unchallenged rule, a defeat would entail serious repercussions for him, his family, his cronies, and many others in his Justice and Development Party (AKP) who have personally benefited from his rule and could likely face prosecution. An opposition win would also constitute a form of regime change, given that its leaders support the restoration of Turkey’s parliamentary system and the curtailment of presidential powers. Erdogan’s sense of vulnerability has grown so acute that the government has used the courts to try to ban a leading potential opposition candidate, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, from running—an extreme move that could ultimately backfire.</p>

<p>Current polls suggest that Erdogan and the AKP could lose the election, scheduled for May 14. For any other leader, such levels of unpopularity and economic malaise might spell certain defeat. But Erdogan is known for his tenacity and his ability to win elections, and he has managed to steady his poll numbers. Given how much is at stake, he is likely to employ almost any means to avoid defeat. As his recent foreign policy moves suggest, he also has several cards to play, and he may seek to manufacture a crisis—including with the West—to change the domestic mood. Europe and the United States must prepare for such a development to minimize potential damage and must have a strategy in place to counter it. Turkey is far too important a country to be allowed to drift away from Western influence.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-30~2023-02-05的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-04/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-30~2023-02-05的言论" /><published>2023-02-04T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-04/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-02-04/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>2003.1</strong> —–2023-01-31 07:40:18+08:00:</p>

<p>马前卒最近提视频的观点里，有一点我比较在意，我没记错的话，好像是提出要用GDP20%的比例去投入相关产业，但GDP作为社会经济活动的总反馈，最基本的个体开销是人，社会化抚养要用来对抗人口下降与抚育质量问题。</p>

<p>而负责产生经济效益的人却不足够去负担这种开销规模，因为没人能足够生产出这种规模的经济效应，除非一个孩子身上花的钱是数个成年人的倍数。但没有人了，又从哪能得到开销的经费来源呢？</p>

<p>政府未来的主要收入就是税金，税金来自于人口数量，人口数量没有，靠政府开销是不可能的。</p>

<p>你说靠发债来保证社会化抚养，赌未来的人口个体收益能填上这个空缺，显然更不可能。</p>

<p>现在的债都还不上，利息都可能逼死地方政府，土地财政的红利也被吃光，留给未来政权可用的财政空间微乎其微，还要用来稳定社会与经济，拯救产业泡沫或可能遇到的通缩。</p>

<p>所以我大体觉得马前卒的社会化抚养，处于一个不上不下的困境，他自己也是清楚，但想推其实也推不上。</p>

<p>原因很简单，第一社会生产力不够，第二社会结构不允许，第三他认为当下不切实际的地方，已经有类似的机制取代，发达国家对监护权和儿童的保护关照是已有的，寄宿学校我觉得是另外一种情况，很多寄宿制学校其实并不适合孩童成长。</p>

<p>人口出生问题我觉得只能靠机制奖励去提高，不能靠新机制取代。老年人口问题反而依赖新机制的结构性改革。</p>

<p>大体上我觉得人类社会工业化后的全面老龄化、少子化，都是“看不见的手”强制平衡全球人口的一种手段，这种基于人类社会行为堆叠后的内源性行为，最终体现就是吸收外来人口移民，强制人类基因、文化与人种融合。</p>

<p>我们需要培育更好的社会个体，是不可能脱离家庭这一单位的，因此利用鼓励和奖励机制去保障家庭单位的质量，才能让个体的精神健康、人格与合作性更强更容易社教化，减少穷多生带来的潜在社会问题与犯罪率，加强亲子关系的纽带，这一点参考隔壁日本，其实应该要解放劳动生产。</p>

<p>解放劳动生产就要提高劳工待遇，经济增长要给知识分子更多社会话语权，让企业有更独立的权力去产业升级，而不是处处要受制于政府。</p>

<p>产业升级完成，我们经济和产业链才有一个在未来全球发展里站得住脚的船锚，内需社会发展起来了，才不会因为外部订单大减随之出现浮动式的经济问题，并且能巩固经济果实。</p>

<p>有更多资源了，才有余地解放劳动力，给更多人口时间生育、养育和培育。</p>

<p>然后就是房子和土地政策，这些必须要改，大改特改，为了这个要不惜一切代价改革，因为房子决定了家庭这一单位的出现数量，家庭数量决定了出生率，虽然不绝对，但大体式这样一个关系。</p>

<p>但现在土地财政吃死了房子这条路，土地财政不倒台，中国出生率和质量也上不去，我们能想办法让政权把这个改掉，出生率就能至少拉起来一波。</p>

<p>谈到这些核心观点，马前卒观点我认为在社会化抚养上就有两种构成，第一是他希望推行的制度倾向，相当于为这碟醋包饺子。第二是他没法提出或者解决上述这些构成社会生育率的核心问题，在这样一个畸形环境里，不改变社会体制的前提下能说出口的，给扭曲成了工业党的社会化抚养。</p>

<p>至于哪个围绕哪个后形成的，就不好说了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2003.2</strong> —–2023-01-31 07:52:07+08:00:</p>

<p>其实换个角度，政府能把补贴落实到单独家庭上，解放劳动力，让家庭有更多时间互动，或者有更好的环境结合（房子），从而让家庭纽带更紧密，这样的强制补贴本质也是可以达到社会化抚养的目的初衷。</p>

<p>家庭的存在是个社会自然演化的现象，现象是不能靠机制一次性渠道的，它现在只是被淡化，较大程度脱离了原本紧密的生产关系，现在处于一个社会观念迭代的过渡期，而不是消失或者不需要了。</p>

<p>所以无法靠一种一代人提出的机制去解决，如果有需要，那肯定是多代人提出来，逐渐补齐的方案，一点点随着社会变化，变成了一种新机制。</p>

<p>但这是需要长期验证的，我们这一代只能填充整个拼图里的一小部分。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2003.3</strong> —–2023-01-31 22:03:40+08:00:</p>

<p>社会化抚养的行政和社会成本，远大于现实里已经落实补贴家庭的鼓励制度。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2003.4</strong> —–2023-02-01 23:44:21+08:00:</p>

<p>走火入魔，误入控制人口歧途 ？你在说什么？</p>

<p>—– <strong>2003.5</strong> —–2023-02-02 00:08:25+08:00:</p>

<p>专职抚养如果是交给市场解决，反而创造更多就业和消费节点，中国始终是双职工家庭居多，即便全职主妇被社会化抚养解放，也只是一个人，而在解放这样的情况前，应该先解放居住和劳动压力，所以说这也是社会化抚养在当下社会有问题的地方。</p>

<p>有很多迹象显示，官方对自身执政可能根本不考虑到2050年代之后，已经默认最近二十多年是最后窗口期。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2004.2</strong> —–2023-02-08 20:36:53+08:00:</p>

<p>政府运作要靠钱，目前政府三大资金来源：</p>

<p>土地财政、税收、债务</p>

<p>分税制不足以维持全国地方政府靠税收运转和扩张政策，主要资金还是很依赖土地财政变现不动产，以及发债消耗未来财政储备空间去获得短期财政。</p>

<p>税收是大体可以算出趋势的，人口和经济增长是不会有大幅度波动的东西，尤其是我国已经脱离了高速发展期，未来政府税收趋势很明朗。</p>

<p>因此主要靠土地财政和债务来判断政府财政安全，债务问题则依靠利息判断，目前政府的利息按照中央控制债务的限额，每年都至少增速在6%-10%以上，多数时候甚至12%-15%，增速远超财政增长。</p>

<p>2016年全国财政收入15.95万亿元，2022年全国财政收入20.37万亿元</p>

<p>2016年利息支出4991亿元，2022年利息支出1.13万亿元</p>

<p>2016年全国财政开支18.78万亿，2022年全国财政开支26.06万亿</p>

<p>七年时间，收入增长27%，但利息开销增长126%，赤字差距也更大。</p>

<p>2016年增值税5.22万亿，2022年增值税4.87万亿（2018-21年峰值约6.2万亿，22年下滑加退税倒跌）</p>

<p>2016年消费税1.02万亿，2022年消费税1.66万亿</p>

<p>2016年全国税收收入13万亿，2022年全国税收收入16.66万亿，也就是说税收收入增长空间已经很小了。</p>

<p>按照这个趋势，政府的财政危机在2030年代就会浮现，七年以后如果利息扩大到2.2到3万亿左右，而全国财政收入哪怕保持增速不变到了26万亿，地方政府因为分税制也只能用约50%的占比。</p>

<p>也就是说2030年左右，地方政府的财政收入可能是13-14万亿，却要承担每年2-3万亿的利息，政府差不多近五分之一的财政要用于利息开销。</p>

<p>到了这个程度，其实还是可以维持的，但是以这个趋势去推算，再滚两次雪球，会变成什么样子我们也可以算出来。</p>

<p>2037年全国财政32-34万亿，地方收入16万亿左右，利息5-6万亿，占比开始高达三分之一。</p>

<p>2044年全国财政40-42万亿，地方收入20万亿左右，利息10-12万亿，占比已经开始到一半。</p>

<p>这样政府根本没法运转，肉眼可见的本世纪中叶中国政府的财政会崩溃，而且因为是分税制的问题，地方承载压力极大，相当于背着两百斤麦子在针尖上跳天鹅湖。</p>

<p>官方还有两个参考指标，第一是十四五规划，远景到2035年。第二个是国土规划纲要到2030年。</p>

<p>直接税改革吹风是跟十四五在20年以后一起来的，这个可以说是十四五的核心项目，但是还没有整起来，如果规划到2035年，可以理解为十四五到十六五是以税务改革为主题的开源节流规划，目的是在2030年代前落成。</p>

<p>而国土规划纲要，直接决定了未来出地的细节和节奏，实际上哪怕到那个时候，政府的出地依然是有限的，也就是说政府坚持维持高房价来保护土地财政安全。</p>

<p>因此从各方面都可以看出，政府已经瞄准了2025-2035年这段最后改革窗口期进去大规模开源节流，因为不考虑其他因素，政府财政到2035年后是必死，土地财政也必然难以为继，一旦债务财政也因为社会对此信心下滑而失去来源，就会彻底玩完。</p>

<p>共同富裕政策肯定会有大规模对企业、中产明里暗里的抽税。</p>

<p>刚好习近平的共同富裕政策规划，核心要点的： 全体人民共同富裕取得更为明显的实质性进展，基本公共服务实现均等化 。</p>

<p>也是目标在2035年实现，但是看土地财政和债务这两个收入来源，一个很难增长，一个不能过度增长，没有钱就不存在公共服务均等化的基础。</p>

<p>那反过来降低服务质量，原本总开销100%，城市70%农村30%，现在总开销70%，城市50%农村50%，理论上也是可以实现的。</p>

<p>总体而言政府会出各种政策，去从民间获得更多的财政收入，确保控制更多的社会财富，但具体手段温和还是激进就不好说了，不排除利用扶持起来的垄断企业控制就业的各个环节，再压榨垄断企业来获取利润，比如控制就业市场，政府抽直接税，以各大企业为单位，谁也跑不了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2004.3</strong> —–2023-02-08 20:53:52+08:00:</p>

<p>毕竟我也不是预言家，只能根据一些不可逆的趋势做判断。</p>

<p>如果说财政的话，应该就是2030年代就会出现明显危机，政府开源节流的做法可能有减缓，但是不会改变这种趋势的惯性，具体数据推测可以看一下我上面另外一个回复。</p>

<p>基本上2035-2045年之间的财政危机是无法避免的，如果他们改了，那么原来的政权就会实质性被更替，如果不改就会原地爆炸。</p>

<p>至于什么形式，我没法下结论，但有几种可能。</p>

<p>比如习近平下台或去世，党内自行改组，或党内发生矛盾，斗争后胜利者放弃共产党外皮进行改革，仍然会持续威权化统治，但是会比习近平时代更好，可能有选举，会类似韩国的路线。</p>

<p>除此之外还有另一种可能，习近平长寿，解决了内部问题，内部无政变且坚持维持现行制度，打算一条路走到黑，最终习近平去世，但地方政府财政破产，出现大面积的地方权力真空。</p>

<p>来自地方的各类既得利益者集团，或者民间的革命者逐渐站到历史舞台上，或有或无与中共内部派系联合、斗争，经过内战逐渐出现一个新政权。</p>

<p>内战的规模可大可小，这是完全没法预测的，因为中国面积太大，人口太多，地方权力一旦出现真空，百分之百有余地给任何人敢于行动的人组织地方武装的机会。</p>

<p>目前只能确定财政危机是无法避免的，走向什么路线，大体我认为不会脱离这两个版本，要么地方没脱离控制中央改组，要么地方脱离控制，回归内战路线，其他大多数可能的局面，我认为也只会基于这两者上出现。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2004.4</strong> —–2023-02-08 21:00:50+08:00:</p>

<p>两条路，一条路硬到底，跟历史车轮碰一碰看看谁骨头硬。另一条路是放权改革，由自己改革避免被清算，或者通过放权来换取减少清算力度。</p>

<p>资产的确有被转移到海外的可能，但这样做会拉满仇恨，因为有转移需求的时候，说明国内他们已经无法控制局面，上来的人对他们有敌对态度，转移大量国有资产，只会进一步引起不满。</p>

<p>其实最优解一直都是自己主动改革放权，换取保留威权时期不当手段得来的财富，还能保留一部分社会地位，不至于阶级下滑。</p>

<p>结构上从放弃赵紫阳的量入为出、谨慎发债路线，搞土地财政与分税制开始算起，这种头重脚轻和依赖有限不动产资源的结构，出现结构性危机只是个时间问题，大概在九十年代中后期开始，但当时政府目的是维护统治，所以不在乎留烂摊子给后代。</p>

<p>当代政府执政上，是从零八年后四万亿的凯恩斯主义成为一种基本经济政策，并且后续持续放水，不肯让市场出清，加大了政府债务压力，习近平上台后稳定大量发债作为政府运作的资金来源。</p>

<p>这种债务在其他国家也有，但是通常不会呈现正三角式结构，国内相当于中央收缴财权看情况分配，地方的参差不齐靠土地财政与债务来填平。</p>

<p>分税制从结构上畸形，是因为管理绝大部分人口的始终是地方，如果中央要收缴财权，让地方政府靠卖出市场潜力有限（国民购入能力），库存量有限的土地来，然后通过发债来维持运营的话。</p>

<p>一旦国民买不起房子，或者只有少数地区的国民高杠杆勉强买得起，大多数地区的土地价格无法一直增长，而政府开销日益扩大，同时举债带来的利息压力跟肿瘤一样吸收公共财政养分。</p>

<p>最后结局就是，过度依赖土地财政，而土地财政不能持续，依赖债务而利息高涨却不能不还，否则会造成一系列信用破产。</p>

<p>凯恩斯主义长期盛行后，加上政治运动导致的金融体系难以稳定建立，让可用的财政工具越来越少，分税制的结构让中央收取大量资金，却不能稳定分发到不同层级的末梢行政单位，进而就会出现越往下的政府越穷，需要办的事越多也越穷这种现象。</p>

<p>内债也是债，而且比外债更重要。</p>

<p>外债某些情况还不了，想赖真的可以赖，因为外国主要制裁或各机构系统拉黑，很少会为了几百亿打过来。</p>

<p>但是内债不同，内债的构成是国内债权人，个人、银行、企业。</p>

<p>欠债不还的结果，是政府信用破产，带来一系列极其负面的反应。</p>

<p>这些债权人形成的债务链条原地爆破，经济倒退之余，政府连税都未必能收上来。</p>

<p>而且跟外债的债权人不在国内不同，内债的债主真的生活在这片土地上。</p>

<p>宣布不还的结果必然会被各种形式讨债。
政府国债恶意赖账也意味着再也借不到新债。</p>

<p>而必须要考虑一个情况，能借债的人必然都有额外资源盈余，你不还债丢掉的是信誉，对方不会饿死。</p>

<p>债主会放弃政府，转而支持其他任何与之对立的势力，甚至资助这些势力来报复政府。</p>

<p>这也是为什么政府宁肯想办法续债拆债，想办法还利息，也不愿真正意义上的恶意赖债。</p>

<p>债本质是一种收益认购，大家用人民币是因为进入人民币市场可以稳定获得薪酬与消费购物。</p>

<p>如果政府无脑超发，大家反应过来就会放弃这种失去价值的交易媒介。</p>

<p>债务同理，如果从政府角度来看，债某种意义上就是税，作为政府的财政来源维持政府运作与扩张。</p>

<p>基本规则就是债务要有收益，税收回报是全面性的，债务则是购买者针对性的，可以实现丰俭由人。</p>

<p>否定债务的收益，就跟否定政府税收会用于公共事务一样，等于否定一切基于公共原则建立起来的法理，也即否定自身的合法性。</p>

<p>可以实现。</p>

<p>刻意追求分裂，是为了分裂而分裂，没什么实际站得住脚的政治和经济解释。</p>

<p>我是实用主义者，不刻求某种方法，重点是人民是否生活得体，个体是否尽可能幸福，是否有利于下一代。</p>

<p>如果分裂真正能带来全国整体的生活水平提升，那么该着它分裂，</p>

<p>但如果不能，就既无必要也没实行的基础，我是指经济和生产基础，因为谈分裂还是大一统都太飘渺，现实不是地图填色游戏，能提高集体生活水平的意识形态才有价值，否则只能在互联网上小圈子自嗨而已。</p>

<p>正相反，应该通过实现民主来维护大一统，确保现在的人口与经济体系不会莫名其妙出现一大堆国境线而产生经济崩溃。</p>

<p>说白了这种事就是自己只要做的好，其他人都会想加入你，自然也就没什么分裂不分裂，统一不统一的，给墨西哥人合法成为美国公民的机会，你看他接受不接受。</p>

<p>经济层面，分裂其实是很难实现的，假设每个省裂成一个国家，这些国家的单一存在法理是不具备的，十四亿人都知道是从一个整体国家碎成渣，还不像苏联那样是一个联盟。</p>

<p>这个完整的法理实体碎裂，外国做生意还是投资都好，都会出现一系列问题。</p>

<p>更别提这些”国家“没有国境线，人口到时候一旦自由流动，根本无法控制，假设是单一的法理实体，西北省份的人还能享受到这个法理实体下，从其他地区获得的免税、投资与全国公共福利。</p>

<p>但分裂后，这个地区的人到上海就是跨国，上海本地都是靠外来人口才能维持基本的劳动生产岗位，一旦人多起来，还无法理约束，维持社会的基本秩序都是奢侈。</p>

<p>还有一点就是货币发行权，如果一个地区一个货币，根本没法跟这个地方做生意，假设统一仍然使用人民币，边远地区穷到响叮当，不是一个国家却有一个货币体系，想一下津巴布韦跟美国都有美元的发行权会怎么样。</p>

<p>津巴布韦能不能控制自己不去滥发美元确保财政稳健？</p>

<p>苏联解体后经济崩溃和休克疗法不理想的一个主要原因，就是因为卢布区的存在，俄罗斯以外的其他国家拼命印卢布，导致俄罗斯根本无法实施预期的财政计划。</p>

<p>而且中国是十几亿人口的国家，人越多的地方还普遍越穷，人要吃饭，穷则生变，没人能保证这些有人口优势的地区，不会去兼并富裕地区，不可能十几亿人，都老老实实看着富哥们的省市独立了，然后安心被移民局踢回家啃窝窝头吧？</p>

<p>所以这些问题稍微往现实方向想，就知道答案了，但我们知道，人的疯狂是可以带动很多人跟着一起发疯的，所以要避免有希特勒一样的个人，或者大跃进一样的社会运动趋势，等错完了再发现不应该这样，就得不偿失了。</p>

<p><strong>“ 国境线而产生经济崩溃 ”</strong> 毫无联系。一战后奥匈帝国解体，捷克斯洛伐克解放，正常发发展。</p>

<p>奥匈是奥地利对匈牙利妥协的这种产物，本身就是多民族国家，却缺乏绝对主体民族，各地有相对主体民族，因此没有转为联邦，而是直接建国。</p>

<p>尤其是奥地利和匈牙利政府各自运作有既定事实。</p>

<p>中国有绝对主体民族，实行单一制，财政实行分税制，采取户籍制度限制人口自由迁徙，各地医保、养老金，全都基于稳定基础下的中央调配。</p>

<p>大量就业机会聚集在少数城市，国境线的产生会导致这些劳动岗位空缺，富裕地区缺乏劳动力，而贫困地区无就业岗位，各地的土地财政分配、债务分配，都会出现倾侧而崩盘的连锁反应。</p>

<p><strong>“ 这些国家的单一存在法理是不具备的 ”</strong> 先秦春秋战国</p>

<p>显然，现代没有任何人和地区可以把法理追溯到春秋战国，追溯到两千多年前，就跟现代称帝一样，而全国统一的法理也来自于先秦。</p>

<p>哪怕在现代追溯法理去建立一个省区域的国家政权，其法理也只能基于清末到民国时期，如果再玩二三十年，民众观念甚至连这段时期都不认可，只默认民国理论版图和共和国，乃至只认改革开放后的。</p>

<p>下面能精简一起谈的我都两个并在一起：</p>

<p><strong>“外国做生意还是投资都好，都会出现一系列问题 ”</strong> 单边贸易协议</p>

<p><strong>“ 西北省份的人还能享受到这个法理实体下，从其他地区获得的免税、投资与全国公共福利。”</strong> 发达经济体凭什么资助黄土高坡人民吃白食？</p>

<p>单边贸易协议的前提是双方接纳，如果过去上海等地长期靠中共的政策优势发展，获取大量的免费劳动力，并且吸纳各地多年来产生的精英人口，突然间切断了税务和社保支出的联系。</p>

<p>那么中原河南地区原来可以去上海务工的农民，不但要承担天价社保和政府债务开销，去上海务工也将从国民沦落为外国劳工。</p>

<p>这种基于剪刀差产生的社会差异，突然间又独立了，那么原来被吃剪刀差又被限制无法发展起来的地区，不会接受这种单边贸易。</p>

<p>发达地区之所以发达，就是因为边远省份的廉价劳动力，在中共的剪刀差体制下，用最低价格给发达地区提供廉价的服务、产品快速发展，同时用低廉公共福利成本保持这些地区只达到基本生存条件，从而更进一步刺激这些地区人口流出。</p>

<p>你应该问，凭什么黄土高坡当近百年廉价劳动力但还是不能合法落户在发达地区。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“人口到时候一旦自由流动，根本无法控制”</strong> 申根区+移民局</p>

<p><strong>“ 但分裂后，这个地区的人到上海就是跨国，上海本地都是靠外来人口才能维持基本的劳动生产岗位，一旦人多起来，还无法理约束，维持社会的基本秩序都是奢侈。”</strong> 矛盾何有？过剩劳动力移动到劳动力稀缺的地方，不好吗？上海本地移民局直接负责管理。</p>

<p>要多少年能建立且民众会老实服从？三十年？五十年？首先效仿申根区要统一法理才有落实空间，但人们的就业、医疗、养老都是即时的，法理认同都会打出脑浆来，基本社会保障不能几十年悬停吧。</p>

<p>中国相当多数的人口都是异地工作，并且户籍制的存在导致大量社保和户籍身份都跟原籍有不同程度的绑定。</p>

<p>突然之间，一个人变成自己故乡的外国公民，回不去了，他的养老和医保随时有作废和不承认的可能。</p>

<p>即便不考虑这个，移民局是一个政府机构，人们通过移民局，移民局才有用。</p>

<p>不通过移民局，十几亿人口只要有春运四分之一的流动量，边境线都拦不住，总部囊河南河北中间放几百公里铁丝网吧。</p>

<p>为什么会有人默认十几亿的人口会老老实实接受一个突然出现的移民局，别说远的，廊坊通勤北京，早上起来自己就变外国人了，企业、户口相关的养老金怎么转移，他购房在京郊甚至天津，工作在北京，按照什么人算。</p>

<p>如果原来没有障碍的事，强制要加一大堆繁琐的障碍，但是不知道惠及了谁，你代入以下这个视角，会不会接受这种扰乱生活秩序，增加民众生存成本的事。</p>

<p>在疫情期间一个城市稍微有点信息，就有不知道多少人步行、骑行返乡，以中共的资源和全国控制能力都拦不住。</p>

<p>那这些人，假设在上海和江苏两地往返，压根不鸟移民局，有没有对等数量的行政资源和基层警务人手去处理。</p>

<p>外国人到其他国家，要么语言不通，要么没有对应身份信息无法找到住房或工作</p>

<p>有多少语言没有任何障碍，住房和就业都没压力，但就是不在移民局管辖范围内的“非法移民”存在？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“如果一个地区一个货币，根本没法跟这个地方做生意 ”</strong> 十九世纪苏格兰以及瑞典取消央行货币发行垄断地位了解一下？清末民初福建多种货币并行了解一下？民国宛西地方自治独立货币了解一下？中央苏区金融体系了解一下？</p>

<p>这就是为什么你不能用现代例子，也就是摆在面前的苏联当基本立证的原因。</p>

<p>从苏格兰到中央苏区，他们有没有一个一次性覆盖十几亿人口，对接全球数十亿人的市场，有上百万亿以单一货币在不同节点流动？并几十万亿的政府债务？且必须为了保证生活水平，每天都要进出口极大量的货物，而这种进出口必须稳定才能保证社会稳定。</p>

<p>瞬间落下一个缺乏法理基础和认同的“各国概念”，拿什么保障稳定生产，稳定生产都不能保证，拿什么保证政府信用和稳定汇率。</p>

<p><strong>“津巴布韦跟美国都有美元的发行权 ”</strong> 美国会更改美元的名字，以便区别竞争，只此而已。市场会自己选择更稳健的货币。</p>

<p>美元之所以是美元，是因为美元能进入庞大的美国市场与贸易体系进行对工业产品的高效率买入卖出。</p>

<p>津巴布韦保留的是无限量发行进入美国市场的等价兑换券的“超能力”，改叫什么名字都没用。</p>

<p>人民币的特殊性在哪，在于中国庞大的市场，上海独立成一个国家，发现上海元。</p>

<p>上海的外来人口占比差不多一半浮动，按户籍算更多，这些人全都变成外国人，上海本地户籍只剩下一千多万，经济活动折半，GDP暴跌。</p>

<p>原本两千多万的就业岗位，一下腰斩，因为都是外国人，没有合法在本地工作权力，也不应该享有国民同等待遇，新国家总不能上来给外地硬盘本地待遇吧？</p>

<p>没有外来人口支撑，服务费高涨，各种工业消费品生产无法达到预期，作为终端，其他地区的大量零部件因为不在一个国家，税率、法律都不同而无法跟之前一样进出口，你的消费市场和可出口能力都非常非常有限。</p>

<p>拿上海元只能兑换到上海本地的上海青？从十四亿人口的消费市场，退化到一千多万人口的消费市场，的确是用脚投票的事。</p>

<p>如果这样做会导致本地经济暴跌，那么强行独立的意义在哪，要赋予什么样的意义才能让普通上海市民承担这种完全不必要的损失，还是说用政治手段强迫他们接受，就跟共和国成立时的公私合营一样。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“老老实实看着富哥们的省市独立了，然后安心被移民局踢回家啃窝窝头吧 ”</strong> 那就打仗好了，正好塑造国民。</p>

<p>人口少的地区必然被人口多的地区吞并，并且因为有法理观念存在，人口更多的政权，会逐渐获得经济与军事优势，进而形成滚雪球。</p>

<p>中原大战国民党没有打出广东就觉得满足，内战里共产党也不是南北对峙就打算收手，中国的人口规模和地理特殊环境，就决定了一旦有一个做大的，就迟早会尝试控制中国默认的法理范围进行统一。</p>

<p>而最关键的是，没有这种必须要打起来的社会基础，绝大多数人不会为了根本没有任何收益的各种妨害民众生活的多余行政操作，去把命都搭进去。</p>

<p>我不明白为什么应该更简化更合理的生活与政府结构，有必要去复杂化，或者反复造轮子。</p>

<p>现在这些地区国际上法理都属于同一个国家，无论共和国还是民国。</p>

<p>那么大陆政权的垮台，也只意味着这些地区的法理会被下一个受广泛认可的政权继承。</p>

<p>我不觉得独立是个问题，但必须有合法程序和认受性。</p>

<p>第一，独立必须在中国法理范围下，如果说趁着大陆地区混乱独立，这种就算国际承认，也不会得到国内的法理认可，如果尊重民意取回这些法理领土，最后还是会回到战争上，所以对这种试图否定共和国与民国的法理，跳出来没有法理来源独立的政权，应该予以彻底否定。</p>

<p>第二，新的统一政权，是否会为地方提供退出的独立机制，如果没有，也就不存在退出的合理机制，新疆西藏这种没有独立政治实体法理来源的，是不太可能被赋予这种机制的，除非当地人真的往死了闹，到时候就看谁手腕硬。（历史上很多这样的例子，但也有不少情况只要经济持续发展，合理放权，矛盾就会减少甚至逐渐平息，现实里为独立而独立不能解决面包问题）</p>

<p>第三，对于原本已经存在的政治实体，如香港、台湾，政权统一而不否定原政治实体的法理的同时，就具备了联邦制的可能，在这种情况下，新疆西藏可能会被部分赋予这种政治实体的待遇，但参考美国，退出机制最终可能在法理上很难实现。</p>

<p>第四，一切退出机制都必须通过宪法来实现和执行，自然也有权参与宪法制定或需求时作修改，不愿意通过宪法实现，不愿通过地方议会到全国议会进行提请与投票执行，又不能否定中国法理的覆盖范围，只会回到第一点。</p>

<p>其实正常情况下很多国家都不会放弃领土，更别提是合法法理领土，这是国家的基本利益所在，跟民主化无关，尤其是一个单一制有绝对主体人口的国家。</p>

<p>未来民主化也会有相对应的威权过渡，这是社会形态的问题，因为人口太多了，十几亿不可能一口气让所有人观念都过渡到自由化思维，仍然很多人更倾向于威权化，人口少的国家反而容易转向。</p>

<p>假设是民主的，但民众的声音又是不一切代价确保法理领土完整，而新疆西藏这样有既定法理和管理事实的地区，有一些人不愿意走合法机制进行独立，被压制是无可避免的（基于宪法和民意授权的合法行为），台湾这种没有管理实施，反而只能用联邦或合并手段，反而方案简单，因为肯定不该对这样的政治实体去开战。</p>

<p>1.你连老婆孩子热炕头都不让他安心，他只能回过头来先解决问题源头。</p>

<p>而另一点你也忽视了，既然一百年前有五四运动，三十年前有六四，近有白纸社运，未来知识分子和青年参与社会的规模只会更高。</p>

<p>基本的民政问题，你突然上海变成一个独立国家，这些民工就能得到更好的待遇吗？肯定不可能，而且会更差，过去好歹是堵嘴不让说不肯做改善待遇，这些有名正言顺的法律去区分非国民。</p>

<p>因为一个国家内，解放户籍制度和分税制，至少可以让民工有落地享受当地公共福利的好处，只要纳税就行。</p>

<p>一个十四亿人口的稳定市场提供的“兑换券”更好，还是一个清除外地人口后只剩一两千万人口且基本物资都无法稳定的更好？</p>

<p>我是不反对自由银行理念的，但为什么到这了都懒得提放到最后，因为自由银行最基本要求的有对应的安全保证，无论是过去还是现代，都不具备其稳定存续的生产结构和社会基础，谁会在高度分裂的状况下，冒险给地方政权抵押资产。</p>

<p>就各地外出务工的农民一赶回家，北上广深和二线城市的经济立刻熄火，连基本生活物资供应都无法满足，起码跟猪肉告别，中国广大农村生产猪肉占全球一半，勉强够国内供应保证合理价格。</p>

<p><strong>“就迟早会尝试控制中国默认的法理范围进行统一。”</strong></p>

<p><strong>您一口一个法理，很奇怪。您建政的法理是什么？国际承认的合法北洋政府最后的宪法是联邦制，甚至不少省份事实上已处在独立边缘。</strong></p>

<p>未来中国任何政权，都只能基于民国与共和国的法理，就跟民国继承清朝法理一样。</p>

<p>而内部的法理构成，很简单，认受性、民众的生活福祉。</p>

<p>一不能为了个人政治目标给广大民众添堵，二没认受性的东西做不到就是做不到。</p>

<p>中共执行农业乌托邦，结果纯折腾自己。</p>

<p>为了执行并无生产力和认受性基础的幻想制度，就必须通过暴力集中权力，打碎先验产生的生活秩序。</p>

<p>折腾三十年，最后还是回归到了最符合社会发展的路线，留下了大量的灾难。</p>

<p>联邦制无所谓啊，我向来不反对甚至支持。</p>

<p>我的基本要求就是现代累积出现的问题改掉，不要瞎折腾老百姓，以民众福祉为首要。</p>

<p>你最起码要确保这些本来就是一个国家没障碍的地区，有一个共通的市场、就业环境、公共福利。</p>

<p>民国那是战乱年代才形成各自为政，但混乱到那种地步外加日寇入侵，湖南这些地方主义，也是“联省自治”，湖南止步于 湖南省宪法。</p>

<p>放开了给你搞，那么乱的年代，各地经济独立性最强的时期都号召建立不起来，现在全国都在一个统一市场，全国人的社保都连在一起，全国土地收益连在一起，硬要拆，跟一个病人病了本来做手术，却乱刀剁碎一般。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“去把命都搭进去。” 既不想舍命打仗，也不愿意回家啃窝头？</strong></p>

<p>这钻的哪门子牛角尖？要么打内战，要么就必须接受导致不公平社会的政治目标？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>结论：建立和维持大一统需要一群心狠手辣之人高度集权甚至独裁，和您自称心心念念的民主化相互抵触。自古以来的帝国主义者，如孙中山蒋介石毛泽东，都是以破坏地方自治为荣的。自古以来的帝国，没有在保持领土完整的前提下完成民主化的。如果民主化选出来的政客对大一统不满意，您是不是就会突然撕掉民主主义者的虚伪面纱，开始铁腕镇压了？</strong></p>

<p>维持统一压根不需要高度集权和独裁，把这两者联系到一起，去反对独裁而为了独立而独立，本身就是一种政治思考走进死胡同钻牛角尖的行为。</p>

<p>一个国家的统一基于共识，现代中国的工业、市场、公共福利系统、土地系统已经高度融合成一个体系，如果拆分必然带来生产力和生活水平的暴跌。</p>

<p>也自然无法在这种事上形成共识，因为它是违背广大中国民众生活利益的做法，会有大量的人反对，到时候为了强行推行独立的政治理念，谋求独立者便可能靠暴力手段挟制民众。</p>

<p>因为地方需要的是放权自治和政策主导权，是由下而上形成统一的宪政体系，而不是由上而下的独立政治诉求。</p>

<p>中国也并非帝国，而是一个一党专政的现代化工业国家，其社会形态与古代农业社会也远不可同日而语。</p>

<p>如前所述，一个国家的统一基于共识，这种法理上的共识，必然有一个宪法体系执行，任何人独立都必须通过该体系合法提请，而不能自我宣布合法。</p>

<p>同样的，基于共识，一个国家如果大部分人都长期且持续坚持的要求独立，压根没共识了，那自然就该独立。</p>

<p>那么问题就来了，已知的当下和未来，一个完整的经济体已然构成，拆解必然带来绝大多数人的利益受损。</p>

<p>到底是为了独立而独立，还是为了解决民生问题而独立，如果路线错误，本末倒置了，谁来负责，不是一死了之的事。</p>

<p>怎么避免现在有一些人，宁可全国人民生活水平倒退，完全不顾大众死活与意愿，也坚持要实行独立来贯彻个人政治追求，从导致生灵涂炭的问题，这应该是你我关注的。</p>

<p>我不是很理解你莫名其妙说这句话的原因。</p>

<p><strong>“分税制让各地政府不能独立运作。”分税制是帝国主义统治方式，独立了还必须给中央政府上贡吗？</strong></p>

<p>一个基本常识问题，美国不需要分税制也能维持政治实体的完整性。</p>

<p>这些地方都分中央税种与地方税种，交错按管辖范围和公民涉及范围征收。</p>

<p>从分税制下直接独立，更加无法正常运作，因为本身财政模式就是芭蕾式用脚尖跳舞，尤其是逐级下向上大规模递交。</p>

<p>突然解放，没有财政来源，没钱就没人办事，也就意味着管制真空。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>现代各省与春秋战国的诸国毫无法理和继承关系” 肯定毫无关系。现代省级行政区继承帝国主义郡县制精髓，旨在分割原本的政治实体。独立反对的就是这种武断恶劣的土地划分方式.</strong></p>

<p>不存在既定的客观政治实体，何来分割？</p>

<p>举例子，上海共和国要独立，法理追溯从哪里开始？春秋战国既然无法理来源，那么倒退近代，清末没有，民国与共和国也没有。</p>

<p>从头到尾不存在一个见于历史的上海共和国。</p>

<p>上海人好端端的，突然你天降一个政治实体给他，然后带来诸多不便，是否有认受性市场。</p>

<p>而且不说国内，全球各地都使用类似的区域行政管理，是人类社会经过长期实践出来的一种管理制度，而不是什么继承帝国主义郡县制的精髓。</p>

<p>中国叫省，日本叫县，美国叫州，还有的国家叫郡或府、区等等。</p>

<p>这是人类后验的一套实用制度，无意义的经验和理性，往往会有灾难性的后果。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“古代就是互相侵略” 民国和共和国就是不互相侵略，法理清晰的现代国家？</strong></p>

<p>共和国与民国是内战，双方只是一个法理国家下的两个政治实体，双方都具有中华的主权宣称权力。</p>

<p>古代没有民族国家的意识，但也有法统观念，因此有五德终始说。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“更别说独立造成的政治和民政分割只会折磨他们。” 这仅是您个人观点，别没事代表别人。</strong></p>

<p>这是事实，任何在中国生活过的人都知道这种观念首先没有普遍认受性，互联网上也缺乏认受性，姨学诸夏系统到经常提及，但他们是小圈子。</p>

<p>而从我之前举例的内容，也证明了落实到实际执行环节，一些根本生活里会接触到的，都会出现这类问题。</p>

<p>并不是我的个人主观，而是有客观依据的。</p>

<p>就好比我说从一百楼跳下来会摔死，也是我的个人观点，但人类社会有一些基础的，具备共通性的事实认知。</p>

<p>政府和民众的生活运作也同理。</p>

<p><strong>“知识分子和青年参与社会的规模只会更高。” 政权更迭看中下级军官。五四主力大部分入了国民党，被赶到台湾后孩子大概率移民美国，与六四少数学生领袖合流。余下示威者游离于主流社会之外，生活窘迫。白纸运动倒是很酷，和独立不冲突。</strong></p>

<p>一个社会正常管理，都在于治理，也即必须考虑到社会主流人群的意见，其中知识分子形成的新精英阶层，决定了社会的最终走向。</p>

<p>而伴随经济发展，精英阶层会更趋于稳定方式，这是任何工业社会无论经过多久都会回到的发展趋势。</p>

<p>新精英阶层是不分阶级的，区别于传统的日子人，一个知识分子转化出来的新精英阶级，可以来自于基层也可以来自于中产、既得利益集团，他们的“精英”特性在于勇于参与社会变革，且积极参与其中。</p>

<p>而政权更迭并不依赖于中下级军官，因为中国缺乏条件长期维持一个军政府。</p>

<p>近代是因为清末过渡到民国军阀混战，然后又遭遇日本入侵等不可抗力因素，因此军事力量成为保障政权生存的基础。</p>

<p>战争年代本身就可以文武不分家，军事已经脱离了古代行军打仗的逻辑，对将领的个人学识和判断力有要求。</p>

<p>国共两党领袖，毛泽东和蒋介石都是知识分子。</p>

<p>毛泽东、李大钊都是五四运动的社会趋势产物， 中共前身之一的觉悟社里，有至少十一人留在了大陆，相当多共产党的核心人物都在五四运动期间扮演关键角色。</p>

<p>甚至共产主义在各地的兴起，也与五四时期的各种推广和组织建设有关。</p>

<p>五四运动中共产主义、自由主义、保守主义三类，最终这三类群体参与了中国之后一百年的社会变迁。</p>

<p>中共自身就是五四运动的主要受益者，也是现在主导政权的政党，他们当中很多核心领导人都与五四运动关联。</p>

<p>毛泽东的孙子毛新宇现在还在大陆。我目前没资料显示他有移民美国与六四少数学生领袖合流的信息。</p>

<p><strong>“全国同胞男子当战，女子当运，皆出分内力量” 一股国民党宣传材料味道。大部分人只盼老婆孩子热炕头，</strong></p>

<p>日本人入侵，轮得到中国人选吗？这个语境根本不需要考虑。</p>

<p>低估人在危机下的主观能动性，本身就是一种对民众追求美好生活诉求本身的不在乎，俗话说兔子急了也咬人。</p>

<p>你都不让他老婆孩子热炕头，光脚的难道怕穿鞋的？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“历史且不谈蒙古和俄罗斯的领土问题一直被骂到现在” 被谁？大部分中国人都不知道这事。“但俄罗斯如果想吞并肢解，没得选只能硬着头皮上。“ 帝国主义大一统的恶果。</strong></p>

<p>帝国主义与法理统一本身就不是捆绑属性，强行错位进行绑定，是明显的政治思想走向二极管，钻牛角尖的产物。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“这些民工就能得到更好的待遇吗？”移民待遇和独立不独立没关系。</strong></p>

<p>外国人不可能获得比本国国民更好的待遇与便利。</p>

<p>而原本这些人是统一国家的国民，只需要解除分税制、户籍制度，即享有在发达地区自由定居的合法权力。</p>

<p>你现在将之剥夺，本身就是有关系，怎么可能没干系。</p>

<p>我们两个共同提出政策，我是做减法，减少生活和政策的障碍，你反而在中共的基础上做加法。</p>

<p>原本可以自由定居的国内城市，强行加上一个移民局，或者进去务工连基本国民的合法身份都没了，对比之前还不如了，有什么利民的可取性么？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“至少可以让民工有落地享受当地公共福利的好处，只要纳税就行。” 独立后，一切移民政策皆由当地选民决定。也许某地极度排外，也许某地很轻松就能入籍，跟您我没关系。</strong></p>

<p>独立是你坚持的政治路线，与你有直接关系，这个责任你是不能推脱的。</p>

<p>一切独立后造成的社会影响，都与你的政治思想有关联。</p>

<p>你不能当甩手掌柜说与你没关系。</p>

<p>我们不实行这个制度和你的政治路线，就连这些问题都不会有。</p>

<p>只需要做减法，取消户籍制度，允许人口迁徙即可。</p>

<p>发达地区通过剪刀差掠夺落后地区的廉价劳动力，从道义角度，这些地区更不应该在发展完以后把人踹开，踹开了的结果也是这些地区无法发展。</p>

<p>原本在同一国家下，只需要通过取消户籍制度，就能允许人口自由迁徙的便利惠民政策。</p>

<p>为什么要依从你的政治路线，特地让各地进行独立，既不在乎过往的历史因素道义问题，也不管过去畸形结构导致的经济发展困境。</p>

<p>如果不能从实际作用角度提出惠民的依据，本身只是政治空想。</p>

<p>那我们应该分清楚，停留在脑海，不需要与现实接轨的政治空想与要处理现实问题的政治实用路线的区别。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“劳民伤财无益广大民众的概念” 大一统最劳民伤财。统治如此大疆域，所需财力人力军力超出想象，否则孙中山和蒋介石为什么和苏联人拉关系？张作霖执意入关争夺天下，结果把王永江省下的钱都败光了。欧洲人殖民也是赔本生意。</strong></p>

<p>因为这些政权对中国有法理和主权上的要求，这些诉求也是合理合法的。</p>

<p>强行在一个有集体认知与共识的民族国家下分裂法理和主权，造成大量的不便捷，才是客观意义上的不实用，不但离地，也没有能惠及民众的可执行路线。</p>

<p>社会进步谋求的是良性治理，但很难明白你为什么一定坚持要统治观念去理解，统治一个小地区就很方便吗？归根结底是某些思维上的东西，是部分统一还是独立的。</p>

<p>就像我现在对你关于独立问题事实上造成民生困境的质疑，其实你也没有个所以然，因为它目前看从现代社会来讲就没有实用价值。</p>

<p>欧洲殖民放弃，是因为融合这些殖民地跟英国本土一样几乎是不可能的事，本质只是外国领土。</p>

<p>而中华地区的文化、语言没有门槛，存在一个法理共识，没有这种融合成本，差异的地方只有现代化高低的程度，也即威权多寡的程度。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“而不是说在这个国家内没有实施合理制度的空间。” 没有。帝国统治者从不施合理的善政，在东方尤甚。</strong></p>

<p>中国社会问题来自于威权程度与制度问题，这是一个客观事实。</p>

<p>来自于威权主义者的政权无法与更现代化的工业社会匹配。</p>

<p>因此去除政权的弊病，革新社会所需，提供更现代化的制度，才符合社会的发展。</p>

<p>一个追求去威权化，走向宪政法治的政权，既可以维护主权完整与法理共识，也能推动社会变革。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“美国就是个很好的例子，联邦财政与州到地方财政分开，中央只负责全国性政策与外交等事项。”美国自罗斯福起就不断侵犯州权，华盛顿的权力极度膨胀，现在五十个州哪个不靠联邦补助款和政策倾斜？</strong></p>

<p>权力单位的结构可以无限拆分。</p>

<p>按同逻辑算，州侵犯的是不是地方政府权力？</p>

<p>地方政府侵犯的是不是更低级的政府单位？</p>

<p>无限细分到最后，就是无政府主义，因为只要向下推演，总有独立主义可以用于拆分。</p>

<p>而现代生产力结构并不能支撑起完整的无政府主义</p>

<p>在一个宪政法治，允许各层级政府合法进行诉讼，民众表达集体诉求，并且存在集体共识的法理环境下，社会只会优化出符合生产力的结构。</p>

<p>地方的立法权、财权和行政权都是相对独立的，美国各州可以完全不要来自于联邦政府的任何资金，但联邦政府可以作为一个中央政府进行大规模发债，覆盖全国范围作为全国性公共服务与军事、外交的开销来源，以此换取州到地方的债务健康。</p>

<p>宪法和税务法律当中，州已经拿到了属于它的那份税收，如果没有一个联邦政府进行政府信用保证，地方也很难拿到跨州的大量资源，无法靠自己一个州就提供居民所需的跨州服务。</p>

<p>许多跨州的联邦公共服务，是联邦政府出资，难道美国人离开本地的获得的跨州公共服务还要本地政府出钱吗？谁来出钱？</p>

<p>国外不是没有分税结构，日本和法国都有一定类似情况，但核心要点在于地方有自治权，你一下升级到独立，先不说合法不合法，就一个地区原本在一个市场和公共体系里的优势就直接消失了。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“回归到地方自治的合理结构，就是多个地方多个大脑手脚，不需要单方面服从中央，中央只作为一个整体性存在。” 权力的本质就是不断扩张，没人满足于一个抽象的“整体性存在”。</strong></p>

<p>因为你没观察到社会发展的一个关键变量，一步错，步步错，所以产生一系列误判，容易走到牛角尖里。</p>

<p>那就是威权化的程度。</p>

<p>中国是一个威权化社会，这样的社会结构里会寻求零和游戏赢家通吃，而不会处于一种稳定的分权结构。</p>

<p>越是落后的生产结构，因为产业单一，越趋于集中权力，农业社会是典型。</p>

<p>工业社会发展后，产业种类越来越多，集中全力反而会让发展无法跟上需求，因此欧洲文艺复兴到工业革命时期，中产阶级和知识分子在社会消费、商业、生产与服务的占比越来越大，逐渐获得了话语权。</p>

<p>进而从威权化的早期民主逐渐扩散权力向下，过渡到平民阶层，美国也是民权运动后威权化才慢慢淡出社会主流。</p>

<p>每个世代威权主义者与其他主义的支持者都有，只不过是比例差异，因为社会形态没发生大的变化，清末就有自由主义者，现代也有威权主义者，但是各自多寡，不可同日而语。</p>

<p>中国是农业社会直接强行过渡到工业社会，国民党与共产党的威权化，而他们的组织者，诞生的年代也都是农业社会威权化思维占主流的年代，因此避无可避的走向威权政党。</p>

<p>然后就是随着工业化进步（包括前三十年的缓慢发展与其他方面倒退），出现了新一批受教育，价值观上能天然接受分权的人。</p>

<p>越往后，越会复现民权兴起的这一过程，因为这是社会发展的客观需要，否则社会无法继续发展，不能持续分权给地方进行自治，给企业与个人进行经济活动。</p>

<p>最后影响的就是社会整体，进而出现不满和躁动，并且威权政府自身的财政来源也会出现结构性危机而濒临崩溃。</p>

<p>你应该想一想，为什么自己对权力的第一认知首先都是这些赢者通吃的思路。</p>

<p>中国人之间法理上没有过去八旗贵族之分，也无殖民地与殖民者之分，虽然都是类同的剪刀差剥削。</p>

<p>而没有类同的情况，正说明是制度本身的问题。</p>

<p>因为威权主义者只能采用这种结构去维护其落后的统治模式，而不能进入平和追求地方自治的分权治理。</p>

<p>威权主义者追求权力的极致，因此价值观上就不接受分权的社会形态，这是现代化与否的一个关键区别。</p>

<p><strong>“最终目的是什么？” 国民利益最大化。</strong></p>

<p>那么原本这些外地劳工，不是本地人，他们有决定权，比本地户籍还多，而他们的家庭又在其他“国家”，他们又不愿意放弃自己的家乡，同时还是上海的持份者。</p>

<p>这个时候就造成一个问题，要么放弃原籍国家，要么只保留所在地国家身份。</p>

<p>并且公共社保等一系列原本统一的服务都不共享。</p>

<p>一个地区独立的原则，是应该只要在当地就算持份者，还是必须有当地户籍才算？你连这个问题都压根没想清楚。</p>

<p>江浙沪有没有从清代就开始独立于黄土高坡的运动？没有，甚至人口经历太平天国战乱，大洗牌过，还有移民是陕西山西等边地迁入的。</p>

<p>江浙沪独立是否有法理？没有。</p>

<p>江浙沪独立是否能为全国和当地的所有在地人员带来幸福与生活安宁？不能，原因上面说了很多了。</p>

<p>共和国有没有江浙沪退出独立的机制？没有。</p>

<p>那么江浙沪有没有机会合法退出？理论有。如果想实现，先请想办法让中共下台，然后在共和国法理内号召，然后在全国投票里将省份退出独立建国的机制写入宪法，然后通过该机制在最高立法机构进行票决启动程序，再到江浙沪投票，通过后自然可以退出。</p>

<p>不存在单方面想退出就退出的不合法行为。</p>

<p>而且你问凭什么？道义上，落后地区为江浙沪提供大量的廉价劳动力，甘愿被剪刀差掠夺，中共治下吃了几十年的政策倾斜，其他地区的劳工、农民和市民就都是持份者。</p>

<p>你应该问问，为什么人类社会都是这样高压统治，但却无一例外走向了权力下放，无论程度。</p>

<p>因为产业单一的情况下，资源有限，因此要管控社会资源和生产，就是一个赢者通吃的零和游戏。</p>

<p>伴随技术进步，形成了商人、知识分子和中产等城市阶级，产业增加而他们的话语权也跟随进步。</p>

<p>社会的劳动价值媒介从权力，转变为金钱，而更多产业也意味着经济权这种古代被控制的权力下放。</p>

<p>二十世纪的共产主义，就是一种控制经济权，从农业社会残留大量威权主义思维过渡到工业社会，有工业社会技术而威权主义思维没彻底褪去的例子。</p>

<p>越晚发展的，经济越不发达，越容易走入威权极端，因为威权本身就很难在一个现代化工业社会里稳定生存，两者是高度不兼容的。</p>

<p>伴随经济的愈发进步，社会都会逐渐产生诉求。</p>

<p>持独立思考动辄大一统的调调，就是思考不足，引入变量太少，到一定程度就不给自己的模型加入变量，就陷入僵局开始钻牛角尖了。</p>

<p>人是要吃饭的，所以社会的底层运作逻辑是物质性的，因此生产结构与生产关系决定了历史趋势。</p>

<p>中国地区是个封闭地理环境，恰巧中原地区却有大面积的耕地。</p>

<p>因此非常容易在中原形成一个超级政权对外扩张，然后就被限制在中国现有版图的地理环境内。</p>

<p>也因为中原地区的耕地面积，除了让一个政权快速崛起外，还能带来负面作用让人口大规模的爆炸，反复进入马尔萨斯陷阱。</p>

<p>也因此，当符合一个古代技术可控制的版图范围被开垦完以后，就开始陷入了不断的内卷，皇帝的权力不断收缩集中。</p>

<p>你回头看历史可以发现，汉代是郡国并行制，这种设计一直到南北朝都有，更晚一点甚至到明代。</p>

<p>而中国帝权的加强，也是从宋代开始，明代成熟，到清代则是巅峰。</p>

<p>这就是该封闭地理环境产生的一个族群制度，在不断优化自身生存的最终产物。</p>

<p>因为没有技术突破，也没法跟欧洲一样分布式小区块避免人口爆炸，还能在后期进行大规模航海，因此中国地区许多东西的发展都停滞了，缺乏竞争而不如欧洲一样能够发展。</p>

<p>距离中国地区最近的一个大型文明聚居地，都要在中南半岛。</p>

<p>苏丹不是民选的，奥斯曼也是多民族追求专制的威权帝国。</p>

<p>你明明知道如果全国地方自治，下放权力允许选举，是一个现代化的法治宪政国家，却非要跟完全不同的东西对比，是什么用意。</p>

<p>我不明白，公开合法的选举，允许你公投，允许你走法律流程，在司法独立的体系下公开复议去获取合法法理，为什么不肯做说是流氓。</p>

<p>难道司法独立、宪政、民选都是流氓吗？</p>

<p>还是说你知道走这种公开合法合理挑不出刺的渠道，根本就没有可能成功，因为压根就没有群众基础，所以掀桌子？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“拿到现实根本不会有人支持你们”您确定将来盘踞中央的那群狠角色支持民主改革？</strong></p>

<p>说很多次了，民主改革是一种社会趋势，一个人可以政治老练，手段强硬的去推广宪政民主，这取决于人的政治理念，而不是手腕。</p>

<p>手段和理念是两种东西。</p>

<p>台湾李登辉也好，还是韩国军政府被倒逼改革都好，都是肯对社会妥协的产物。</p>

<p>事实就是事实，你不服气有什么用。</p>

<p>这叫做现实感，而不是活在自己唯心主义世界观里，许多键政人士离地，就是小圈子不基于现实实有的问题讨论，也不去解决问题，而是为了政治而政治。</p>

<p>因为“<strong>僭主暴秦和由胜利者书写的大一统史观毫无法理可言，您却默不吭声。</strong>”</p>

<p>这根本就是个毫无逻辑的事，你停留在一个幻想的当中，认为是秦朝带来的问题。</p>

<p>然而秦朝之前，东西周就已经有郡县制的雏形，春秋战国时期各地都在进步，包括跟秦朝商鞅变法一样的军事社会改革。</p>

<p>这不是大一统史观，而是地理决定了社会的客观运作趋势。</p>

<p>你不承认社会发展的必然性，那不就是唯心主义不跟现实对接么。</p>

<p>你说毫无法理，但中国是一个民族国家，共和制后，就算完全不管古代，也有现代法理，就算不考虑现代，未来也有民众认受性用票选出来的法理。</p>

<p>这不是史观问题，而是你这样的边缘政治观念试图与十几亿国族叙事史观对抗，如果你想颠覆这种情况，就要有足够多人支持你，让你能有话语权颠覆值。</p>

<p>但显然不可能有。</p>

<p>共和国与CCP高度绑定，是CCP的主观行为，CCP自身无法维系，共和国就是一个中立存在。</p>

<p>决定政策的执政者，而不是国体，因为国体是死的，是可以改的，前三十年计划经济，后三十年怎么就南辕北辙的改革开放了？</p>

<p>说白了党政的最高权力换了一批观念不同的人。</p>

<p>你说不存在就不存在，那好吧，就当不存在了，共和国垮台了，民众的生活大乱，人们的生活诉求就变成谋求建立一个新的共和国。</p>

<p>未来历史就是我们这一代和我们下一代书写，中共已经进入生命末期，这是所有人都感受得到的，数据上也能反馈出来的共识了。</p>

<p>我们已经处于一个清末1870-1890年代的时期。</p>

<p>所以我采用社会经济与人口发展的角度切入，告诉你为什么你想独立都没有任何基础，都是很诚恳的描述你必须去做，而你也没有办法解决的地方。</p>

<p>是站在独立角度去思考有没有可行性，而不是说我想要，所以它就应该这样，但世界毕竟不是围绕着我转的，对不对？</p>

<p>这也是为什么我说实用主义大于一切，我围绕民生转，而不是说我让民生围绕我的政治观点转，如果民生与我的政治观点不符，我就不承认不理睬无所谓死活。</p>

<p><strong>缔造共和国的元勋是群否定私产，欢迎日本侵略，饿死千万，整昏一亿，开坦克轧学生的苏联间谍？CCP当年反自由化，现在反历史虚无主义，就是不允许在他们创造的国家内否定他们存在的意义。</strong></p>

<p>共和国是个多党派多方利益一起缔造的国家，中共确实是主体，但共和国建政早期，有很多民主党派和党外人士，发挥了不小的作用。</p>

<p>但是随着中共政权稳固，就开始专制边缘化他们而已。（我记得我明明说过了， 你有在看吧）</p>

<p>所以政治上，共和国本身就是一个出身相对复杂的，当然你非要说我其实也不介意，因为这件事有很多替代方案解决，大多数民众也不一定会支持。</p>

<p>如果要更替共和国，无非也就是换皮而已，除非你能以一地之力，消灭十几亿人口的政府。</p>

<p>否则无非是不叫共和国，原来的政府体系换皮上班，毕竟生活还要继续。</p>

<p>而更换共和国名称，可能带来大量的外交、经济、生活的不便利，如果从便利角度，未来是否会更替也是个有疑问的事。</p>

<p>不换国名，保留共和国名，更改宪法，方案一。</p>

<p>换国名，更改宪法，方案二。</p>

<p>只取决于民众和到时候执政团体认为哪个更方便更符合社会需求而已。</p>

<p>你否定中共没人管你，但共和国不是一个名字，当然她可以是一个名字这么简单。</p>

<p>共和国是一个完整的政府体系，换了名字，她本质还是“共和国”而已。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2004.17</strong> —–2023-03-12 17:10:44+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>民国和共和国在现代都已经承认了蒙古独立，更下版本吧。”</strong></p>

<p><strong>蒙古当年独立于民国，并没得到北洋政府许可。这是我所强调的。相当于吴国独立于中国，后者几十年后才承认。</strong></p>

<p>有点现实感和了解再下侃侃而谈吧，独立是你一句话振臂一呼就有人响应的么？</p>

<p>清朝就是以宗主国名义下，令蒙古实行高度自治，清末蒙古趁机独立以后想南下，立刻就被北洋军攻击，最后调停放弃独立转而变成共和制的自治。</p>

<p>北洋政府当时已经事实承认不是主权而是宗主权，连北洋政府想去派驻军都可以拒绝，已经事实上独立。</p>

<p>找机会得以进入蒙古后，徐树铮因为改制有撤销自治的打算，遭到了反对，跟着因为内战原因主力撤离，被当地抓到机会武装反抗夺回控制权，然后靠苏俄支持在最终站住。</p>

<p>并且因为孙中山需要联合苏联，北洋内部乱战出脑浆来，根本没有实际资源和经历处理蒙古问题。</p>

<p>随后蒙古长期处于苏联控制下，二战结束后国民党与苏联谈判，因为国民政府压根没能力处理日本人也打不过苏联，斯大林坚持要外蒙古作为军事缓冲，作为苏联出兵的条件。</p>

<p>而且双方也同意要<strong>基于当地的投票选举</strong>来看蒙古是否愿意独立。</p>

<p>所以最基本的你都没搞清楚外蒙为什么独立。</p>

<p>第一，外蒙本身在清代就是高度自治，是清朝的外藩。</p>

<p>第二，蒙古单方面想独立，内地有派兵去夺取。</p>

<p>第三，蒙古能独立，因为二战时期中国内外交困。</p>

<p>第四，有一个极其强大的外部接壤势力，且有核心利益交换。</p>

<p>第五，蒙古独立也是要基于当地投票这一程序的。</p>

<p>蒋介石对这件事的态度也是：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>第一， 我对于民族平等，自由的思想，向来认为是天经地义的事，只要其<strong>民族</strong>有独立自主的能力，我们应该予以独立自主的。</p>

  <p>第二， 外蒙古所谓蒙古人民共和国，自民国十年设立以来，事实上为俄帝所控制，我们政府对于外蒙古领土，实已名存实亡了。</p>

  <p>第三，只要我们国家能够自立自强起来，外蒙这些民族，终究会归到起祖国怀抱里来的，与其此时为虚名而蹈实祸，不如忍痛割弃一时，而换的国家二十年休养生息的机会。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>最后之所以出问题，是因为苏联方面违约支持中共，再到后面就是打不过苏联。</p>

<p>等能打过苏联了，中国已经进入经济发展为主的改革开放，蒙古独立已经成为事实。</p>

<p>你历史问题基本功不过关，但网络时代你查都不愿意查，张嘴就来，可以反应你这个人对这些复杂事务其实不屑于采取一个认真研究的取态，那你提出的方法是否有可实行性与价值，其实已经揭晓答案了。</p>

<p>所以你想吴国独立必须满足这些条件，起码要有：</p>

<p>1.第三次世界大战打到十四亿人的中国无暇管理。</p>

<p>2.有一个能持续投送几百万人的大国愿意为吴国独立开战。</p>

<p>3.有战前长期自治的事实，有当地的原生民族与文化。</p>

<p>4.并且通过公投最后表决独立。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2004.18</strong> —–2023-03-12 20:38:07+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>“孙中山和其他革命党都没追求称帝”这能为引入苏联人和CCP盖黄埔军校毁掉广东自治尝试，北伐中原辩护吗？连吴佩孚和张作霖都不耻于跟苏联合作。难道孙党拉低了斗争底线，仅不追求称帝，故而不该受谴责？</strong></p>

<p>跟蒙古问题一样，你起码要了解了再说，不要想当然。</p>

<p>独立和自治是两个完全不同的概念。</p>

<p>陈炯明提倡的联省自治，不是让孙中山放弃全国统一，而是全国统一后联省自治形成一个地方分权的局势。</p>

<p>而地方自治跟统一政权本来就不矛盾，是你自己非要按照自己钻牛角尖得到的观念理解，美国是统一国家，但也地方自治，这种例子数不胜数，因为行政单位本身就不可能无限细分，没有威权主义者当政才会带来稳定的自治社会。</p>

<p>再有，吴佩孚跟俄罗斯人也曾经有联络，也在寻求外援，军阀都是如此，没能力做大而已，张作霖跟日本人合作勾兑，也是事实，只是他们都有分寸，从来没偏离以中国统一为核心的政治路线。</p>

<p>实际是与你的政治观念冲突，如果给你放到那个位置上，你是不会寻求南北议和统一的。</p>

<p>因为一系列话语下来，可以判断你本质追求的是独立，而不是地方自治，不为过吧？</p>

<p>这些人无一例外都是希望通过外部力量支持统一中国政权，而不能协调的根本原因就是人人手里都有军权和兵力。</p>

<p>而中国刚刚共和制，仍然是威权主义社会形态，这种矛盾是无法避免的。</p>

<p>从古代帝制过渡共和制，既无议会传统也无民众广泛的基础，命都保不住的年代，斗争底线在哪？</p>

<p>军阀战败下野，而不是灭族屠城，比历史上任何一个朝代终结的乱世都够有下限的了。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“宋教仁又怎么说？”没错，宋教仁是好人，宋教仁守底线，宋教仁懂法律，所以宋教仁被刺杀了。追寻大一统的道路上，自古以来，正经人早退。连您所喜爱的胡赵万，虽然污点一大堆，仅仅因为脑子灵活，素质稍高于平均水准，也走不下去。</strong></p>

<p>首先，宋教仁按照你的叙事观和路线，也不是好人。</p>

<p>宋教仁追求的也是统一，而非地方为独立而独立，你是为独立而追求独立，他是追求统一自治分权。</p>

<p>宋教仁是我们这面的，不是你那边的。</p>

<p>在你的逻辑里，追求大一统，就是违背底线，是该杀的。</p>

<p>其次，你不加入威权变量，是因为你本身就是非主观上的客观威权主义者。</p>

<p>举例子，因为你的叙事其实本质跟毛泽东的农业社会主义一样，是一个政治理念根本无根基和实施可能落实，因此你想实行，就必须违背人性与大众的基本需求。</p>

<p>进而引发一系列政治运动，你需要不断通过某些手段来加强自身政治路线的安全性。</p>

<p>否则你根本无法推行自己的政治路线，因为没有市场，共产主义在近代好歹也是有压迫的事实基础，而形成政权后无一例外发现不能与现代生产力对接。</p>

<p>先不谈你说污点一大堆是否属实，但如果在你观点里，政治必须洁白无暇，那你肯定做不到，你做不到的自然没法作为政治道德高地去审判他人。</p>

<p>所以胡赵万你就别碰瓷了，按照你的逻辑，改革开放前，全国各地实质性处于混乱自治状态，经济和意识形态都不稳，某种意义上反而是最接近你追求的独立边缘的时候。</p>

<p>他们假设只是你嘴里的稍高于平均水准，承认都那么勉强不乐意，都能把这个社会从分裂边缘拉回来。</p>

<p>那说明你根本没可能成功，只是嘴硬而已。</p>

<p>这也是为什么姨学在内的一系列诸夏和独立论者，一直被边缘化没有任何话语权，话术和名词到是传播很广。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“你把人想的不分青红皂白，毫无灰度”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“威权主义者追求权力的极致，因此价值观上就不接受分权的社会形态”</strong></p>

<p><strong>1） 人类普遍追求权力的极致</strong></p>

<p>如前所述，因为可能问题就在于你自身就是一个没有意识到的非主观威权主义者，才会默认人对权力追求极致是普遍性的。</p>

<p>你默认的这种情况，那大多数人就根本不可能与你合作，你的路线就无法展开，因为所有人在你眼里都是这种需要被肃反的潜在“大一统独裁者”。</p>

<p>然后问题来了，一旦你控制军权政权，而你的路线无法被实行，导致你有下台的可能，就会跟建国前三十年一样，为了执行自己的政治路线进行各种整肃。</p>

<p>而你的政治路线本身，包括许多独立论者，都清楚并不具备实际执行的可能，只不过其他人是开天窗，认为如果没自治还不如强行独立，如果有自治也就不追求独立，他们追求的是权力结构的合理化，而你在他们之中也可以是更激进的那种。</p>

<p>出生在威权社会的人，才大概率会被威权主义思维影响，认为这就是世界运作的规则，进而作为行为模式的底层逻辑去与人和世界互动。</p>

<p>人们的观念是逐渐变迁的，</p>

<p><strong>2） 贝当是威权主义者，但受著名威权理论家Maurras启发，把部分权力分割给恢复成大革命前形态的省级行政区</strong></p>

<p>历史趋势真正底层逻辑在于随着社会生产力变革，地方自治和权力下放，前面说过很多了。</p>

<p><strong>3） 咱们俩谁更善恶二元论？</strong></p>

<p><strong>“而且与历史趋势对着干的，没有好下场。”大先知， 失敬失敬。您对历史趋势的定义似乎很犬儒？金日成的下场怎么样？历史趋势若是对百姓不好呢？是不是得投机，一开始批判中国历史周期律和支持湖南独立，然后自比秦始皇加马克思？</strong></p>

<p>这就是为什么你钻牛角尖，观点也立不起来的原因，你对问题的判断过于线性，看东西不够全面清晰。</p>

<p>我为什么跟你说加入变量，因为当一个问题自行推导无法解决时，必然存在没有观察到的地方，你是卡在了某个舒适区，就不愿意改变。</p>

<p>那为什么你不加变量？可能只是加入变量太复杂，就超出你能理解的范畴了。</p>

<p>加入变量来建立一个符合社会实际情况的历史观体系，也是我一直在强调有必要做的事。</p>

<p>什么叫历史趋势？历史趋势不是单纯意义上的天道好轮回，而是科技变化对生产力的改变，进而对社会结构的催动。</p>

<p>人的一生是历史趋势的最基本单位，顶多七八十年。</p>

<p>如果按照青壮年算，一个人观察历史的窗口，不过五六十年。</p>

<p>历史趋势并不描述不在乎一个人的得失，而是整个社会的集体转变。</p>

<p>举个例子很简单，计划经济和社会主义，苏联可能可以继续存在，但他们实行的制度必然消亡。</p>

<p>就如同中国必然走入改革开放，但没人能保证改革开放是否就会有现在这么好的效果。</p>

<p>印度也放弃计划经济寻求进入市场，可是他们改革就不好。</p>

<p>经济体制的转变，是社会生产力决定的必然趋势。而他们好和不好，是多种可能性之一。</p>

<p>就跟你吃饭是必须的，会不会噎死，纯粹看个人在某一时间地点这些客观因素。</p>

<p>清廷有没有余地选择不放弃帝制，一直把辫子延续到2023年？</p>

<p>所以金氏王朝，是不是必然崩溃，这是必然的。他们甚至已经改制来适应历史趋势。</p>

<p>社会是一个集体概念，而不是具体到个体身上，就算现代生产力富足，一样有悲剧。</p>

<p>最基本的简单问题，我问你计划经济和市场经济，在当下生产力下哪个更好更符合社会集体所需？答案不言自明。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“共和国与CCP高度绑定，是CCP的主观行为，CCP自身无法维系，共和国就是一个中立存在。”</strong></p>

<p><strong>中立？前苏联资助，CCP缔造，反人类罪犯润之宣布成立，开国十大元帅全是汉奸。怎么把民主党派当主角？他们从一开始就被统战部渗透成筛子，靠周恩来在香港的布局才狼狈进京。若斯大林不施压，1954年前连内阁都入不了，文革时期更直接被取缔。这种只配在政协喝茶的乌合之众，也许会在民主化进程中派上用场，可依靠其去论证目前共和国是中立的，非常滑稽，言论自由下新版国史都没法诚实地写。</strong></p>

<p>纯粹把共和国的建立放在国共两党斗争上，就忽视了国共两党内外有瓜葛的不同派系，来自党外的中立与民主党派的影响。</p>

<p>这些来自于不同势力的存在，不但参与了中共建政前的各种利益与资源转让，在国内有舆论施压的能力，也能在国民党内部进行活动，还在早期国务工作上发挥了不小的组织作用。</p>

<p>他们的消亡，来自于中共建政后权力稳固的多次斗争，是有一个过程的，</p>

<p>孙中山派系分裂后，相当多人中立或左派人士都流入了共产党或一些同期共产党的组织，所谓的渗透，反过来其实就是本身这些人就利益与立场有互联，如果国民党赢了，那就是国民党把共产党渗透成筛子的叙事了。</p>

<p>所以这就不得不提你分不出政权与执政党的区别。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>这种国体下的全国人大，脱胎自苏维埃，有原罪，浑身散发着列宁同志民粹主义气味。权力极大可开会时间极少，代表过多，又故意设置成兼职，导致所有事物全部交由CCP占绝对多数的常委处理。有改革这个东西的时间，足够成立两个符合欧洲标准的国民议会了。</strong></p>

<p>其实这个根本就不需要考虑未来，直接从过去找经验即可。</p>

<p>苏联解体后，苏联势力范围内，原本的国家被解放出来，共产党失去执政地位，政权直接改组成一个新国家。</p>

<p>东德先完成了内部权力变迁，然后直接两德统一，而不是继续分裂下去。</p>

<p>按你的逻辑，德国理应继续分裂才符合人民预期，而不是东德快速转型然后合并。</p>

<p>中共执政因为权力从上往下，你无论如何解体，都根本不可能解散全国十几亿人的全国政府，也不可能遣散七百多万公务员。</p>

<p>正是因为权力集中，其不合理性才来自于少数人非整体。</p>

<p>而且我不觉得你会真正尊重地方治权，因为就算给你独立了，也一样会有中央政府和地方政府的区别，只不过结构从大变小，结构本质没变，你现在给出这种判断，就反应你的取态。</p>

<p>任何一个国家都不存在只有地方政府，因为权力结构下放是无限的，而必须有政府统筹全国各地运作，尤其是负责跨行政区的公民公共服务。</p>

<p>美国联邦与州、地方政府，各自按照宪法收取税收，非必要互不干涉，地方不够钱用，需要找中央帮忙，你没发现这里有不对劲的地方吗？</p>

<p>地方已经有自己的税收，是中央按照宪政不能干预的，这部分财权就是实权，包括地方议会的立法和审批，要不然也不会有各州法律和时薪不一的情况。</p>

<p>陈独秀和李大钊、张申府这也的五四运动核心人物就不用提了，鲁迅思想上也偏左。 新潮的几个人，段、罗、傅等人五四后就出国留学，就没几个深度从政的，要是带头就是一切，那六四来来去去就是几个人的游戏了。怎么不看看其他五四运动的核心呢？</p>

<p>而且五四运动是全国性运动，我们来看看各地运动的重要人物里，有多少与中共或者共产党、左派有联系。</p>

<p>天津：周恩来、邓颖超、张太雷、 李震瀛等</p>

<p>李大钊在五四时有《我的马克思主义观》等刊载，并且在北京大学内有马克思研究会到社会主义研究会，正是因为五四运动产生的一系列政治与社会变化，才促进了中共的诞生。</p>

<p><strong>“外地人口比本地还多，成立国家，应该按什么来作为获得国民身份的依据。”</strong></p>

<p><strong>这也是为什么移民政策必须本地化的理由。拥有本地户口的人自动成为选民，他们选出政客决定如何入籍，依照什么标准向外国人（原来没有中国籍或者原户籍不在独立国土内）颁发居住证和绿卡（工作满3年5年？学习当地方言？）。</strong></p>

<p>外地人口比本地人还多，而且你要用继承自中共的户籍制度去规划身份，本身就是反对大多数人。</p>

<p>外地人与本地人的唯一区别，就是来自于中共执政建立的户籍制度，该制度是剥夺身份，制造身份差异的来源，明明应该废除，你却要继承。</p>

<p>而户籍上的外来人口，也是事实上的本地人，你却要剥夺他们的政治权力。</p>

<p>那为什么不允许只要在当地就是本国人，享有投票权呢？</p>

<p>你独立不可能无视这些人的存在，嘴巴上独立，对不对。</p>

<p>还是说默认这些比本地人还多的外来人口，全程静默边缘OB？</p>

<p>如果一定要独立，这些人的影响力远大于本地人口，因为他们支撑起经济、社会运作，人数也比本地户籍多，哪怕票选，最后也是基于他们的利益。</p>

<p>因为事实他们本身就是本地人，你的划分是根据中共户籍制度的产物，而非基于事实。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>一个地方有一个地方的规矩，在无锡拿绿卡入吴国籍容易，在上海可能就难，谁现在也说不准。如果真的是民主主义者，应当把赋予政治共同体身份的权力交给基层选民，相信他们的直觉。他们排外就排外，包容就包容。</strong></p>

<p>你现在剥夺了一大群在本地生活居住的事实住民的权力，然后只允许继承中共户籍身份的人才有政治权力可以投票，本身就是违背权力交给选民这个流程。</p>

<p>因为你控制着谁可以成为选民的权力，跟中共控制谁可以成为候选人有异曲同工之妙。</p>

<p>选举不是根据选民直觉，而是根据你排他性的设计进行的。</p>

<p>你在上海，工作生活五六年，圈子都在这，也在这买房了，因为没有户籍身份，突然就变外国人了， 凭什么？</p>

<p>方案只有且只能有一条，就是只要在当地，就是本国人，无论来自哪。</p>

<p>然后基于这个比例去投票是否要独立建国，并且非本地出生的人口，必须放弃一切本国政权不承认之社会身份，或作自动失效。</p>

<p>否则独立性的法理与社会公共层面便不完整。</p>

<p>除非独立瓦解是基于共识之上，否则连达成这一步都做不到，这也是为什么我说你根本没有成功和实践的可能。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>况且，独立跟闭关锁国毫无联系，根据方言民俗和历史渊源，中国土地上是没有可能冒出欧洲那么多国家来的，最多十个。</strong></p>

<p>基本地理常识，中西部一无海岸线，二无发达经济，三人口膨胀。</p>

<p>怎么保持这些地方的经济水平不下滑，原本维持经济增长的就是分工体系，你拆解了分工体系，还要重新谈税率和贸易。</p>

<p>现实当中国与国之间的贸易谈判都是诸多拉扯，你有什么信心或者依据能保障这些矛盾差异更大的地区，会按照你预期去瞬间接受一切协议。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>成立个华夏联盟，先接管核弹头和成立华夏人权法院，再推行联盟成员国之间贸易自由，公民流动自由。</strong></p>

<p>欧洲那种古代世仇的民族国家，目前都是往最终融合一体化发展，希望发展出一个统一的政治实体，而不是持续分散化，那这面按照社会趋势也是必然的。</p>

<p>虽然有点粗俗，但请问脱裤子放屁的目的何在。</p>

<p><strong>重要的是独立后塑造良好营商环境，效法加拿大魁北克混合法系，建立联邦宪法法院；邦最高法和巡回法院；市中央法院和地方法庭，商法大部分依靠中立仲裁组织。再模仿意大利，将检察官移出行政线，交由法院法官调配。剩下的事还一大堆呢。包括，军队改革，军衔简化，设立民兵（类似加州卫队），对外情报和对内情报机关组建，全国自由港化，禁止国家持股做生意，私有化路桥，将自然环境保护区义务移交非政府组织。</strong></p>

<p>​</p>

<p>但如果我独立了，我为什么还要建立联邦？为什么吴国要跟燕国遵从同一宪法？</p>

<p>凭什么我吴国的人要归联邦宪法法院，这是联邦的东西。</p>

<p>而且凭什么要有中立仲裁组，难道外国的仲裁和法院判完了，我国就必须执行到底吗？谁赋予这些组织权力管一个主权国家的。</p>

<p>凭什么还要来管我们的行政权？</p>

<p>不想实行军队改革，也不愿意靠拢这些不符合国家利益的东西。</p>

<p>如果我是上海共和国，就要跟新加坡一样时刻提防吴国的吞并，不但不能简化，还要大规模的军事化，且要人人服役。</p>

<p>你从头到尾都没思考如果这些国家如果都不接受这种方案，并且强敌环绕矛盾冲突加剧，边境土地、基建、资源的争夺如何处理。</p>

<p>领土和资源问题都没形成共识，这些土地边界又不是自古以来约定俗成，而是你突然间临时划分出来的，那为什么他们要接受你给的标准，而不是兵强马壮者为王？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>您绝对又跳出来大喊，重复造轮子，本来就是一国人… 对了，怎么都行，就是不当一国人。当了一国人，必定有欲壑难填的中央政府。而中央政府不是您亲人，不会执行您的计划。</strong></p>

<p>上面已经吐槽过了，现实当中一个政治划分，而不是通过民族、文化划分出来的版图，必然因为没有约定俗成的历史因素而造成矛盾。</p>

<p>美国日本还是欧洲各国，都存在中央政府，你把一切问题都归结于中央政府的存在，从现实人类社会的发展而言是站不住脚的。</p>

<p>也因此你一开始的立论错了，所以你之后每一步推演都错。</p>

<p>就像你提出的这些要求，如果没有共识，根本就无法推行哪怕半条，自己主张独立居然还能说出联邦宪法法院。</p>

<p>联邦是地方分权制度，有中央政府。</p>

<p>跟你要求没有中央政府的独立是完全相反的东西。</p>

<p>你要求独立，就别指望这些东西，各国的内政外交经济全都是独立的，任何有中央调度统一的政府，都不符合你的政治路线，你要是支持那就是承认本身就可以通过在一个体系内改革达成目标。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>全国地方自治，下放权力允许选举”</strong></p>

<p><strong>这引出了您计划的矛盾之处。您一面推崇地方自治，一边又自称，也推荐我，认同几百年国史主流叙事，却不愿看到，中国传统政治思想教导优秀的君主加强中央集权，以防地方豪强做大，可坐视地方豪强做大，管理家乡，恰恰是地方自治的特征。</strong></p>

<p>首先，你是为独立而独立，你要建立的是独立的主权国家，至于独立后的地方是否又要独立，是否该拆解独立后的中央政权，又要另论。</p>

<p>其次，我推崇地方分权自治，这不是独立，因此地方自治与你提倡的独立，是两种相反的政治路线。</p>

<p>再者，你用古代社会形成的生产秩序和社会规则，去硬套一个高度工业化，且未来会持续进步的国家，把农业时代的威权主义残留惯性，当作是永恒的事物，印证了前面所说的，人的寿命是观察历史的基本时间单位。</p>

<p>而你只用这么一点时间，就默认未来永恒是不变的，这是脱离社会变迁的一种狭隘观点。</p>

<p>因为你搞不明白，为什么社会能自发性的进步，因此你也会忽略为什么帝制结束走向共和，你只是单纯的默认都是坏的，而不去加以细致区分。</p>

<p>即便这些东西早一百到几十年前都被前人思考过了，而且你很多历史和对事物的研判态度能力都不怎么到位，导致你看东西更容易出现误差，就出现立论错误，步步跟着错的情况。</p>

<p>举例子，中央集权是君权，古代皇权是威权象征，根本无法下放到地方，地方主要由政府的行政官僚和地方宗族自治形成，这个情况一直持续到共和国建政。</p>

<p>而共和国和苏联之类的国家能控制地方，也是依靠工业化下的庞大资源与技术，让通信和交通网络建立，才能完全掌控。</p>

<p>而这样的社会在农业社会里是无从建立的，同样的，更高发展程度的工业化社会，这种管控也无法持续维持。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>尤其是您谈到的权力下放是单一制国家的devolution，中央保留随时收回的权利。新中央若浸淫在您所奉为教条的大一统意识形态里，那么根本不会进行良善治理。</strong></p>

<p>权力先放并不能被随便收回，改革开放就是经济权力下放，一旦权力落实到个人身上，除非你有能力控制每个人和他们能形成的组织，还能压制一切反抗声音。</p>

<p>在落后的非工业国，尚可以考暴力组织进行社会控制，但庞大十几亿人的工业国，单纯生活水平下滑，都会带来巨大的负面反馈。</p>

<p>权力意味着让人默许可以做或被驱使的范围，这种覆盖面并不是你认为那种想收回就收回，权力不是金钱，不能被数字化与轻易分割转让。</p>

<p>基本推演就知道，中央下放权力给地方，允许地方选举，这种习惯一旦形成，中央根本不可能收回。</p>

<p>因为中央的权力构成此时来自于地方的民众选举。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>因为主流政治价值观必使中央的神经脆弱敏感，将地方自治等同独立，视为大逆不道；跟邓看到学生和平游行，居然病态地立马联想到政权不稳，需要下死手一样。所以它可能先虚与委蛇，出于统战，假意妥协（郡国并行），待羽翼丰满再一举暴力削藩（七国之乱），实现强干弱枝。正如造反和渎职都判死刑，那还不如造反痛快；既然独立和自治在执政者眼里差不太多，那还不如独立。不等待中央主动施舍，直接起事，豺狼般群起分食原本高度聚集在一点的权力，客观上形成权力多极体系，互相制衡。</strong></p>

<p>首先搞清楚第一点，你追求的是独立本身，而不是地方自治与分权，是基于这些之上的另外一种政治诉求。</p>

<p>哪怕统一有中央政府的国家里，美国日本还是其他国家无论怎么样能实行，在他们的国家里，你始终会提倡无条件独立。</p>

<p>我们不要把他们混淆。</p>

<p>即便中国是地方自治、民选习惯稳定、高度法治的宪政现代国家，你也是要谋求独立的。</p>

<p>而你自己不引入变量，即便我提过了，你也无法理解，就说明问题所在。</p>

<p>唯一变量就是威权主义对社会与执政团体的影响和构成。</p>

<p>你似乎不承认社会伴随生产力变化，会产生演变的历史趋势。</p>

<p>如果趋势存在，也即可以证明人类从威权化里脱离，只是个时间问题，那么你为了独立而独立的理由就不存在，因为这可以证明国家统一下完全可以进行内部改革。</p>

<p>如果你不承认历史发展有趋势，社会的变迁会随着技术与经济进步不断变化，演化出合适的政体，就等于否认现代人类发展历史，否认中国从帝制到现代的进步。</p>

<p><strong>而且最大的槽点是，各地起事，与去中心化，本身就是互相矛盾的。”</strong></p>

<p><strong>出自维基百科：地方分权 (Decentralisation)、分权自治或权力分散，是“权力去中心化”的简称，“中央集权”的对称；指国家权力之一部，归由地方政府行使的制度，目的 为竭力谋求限制上级权力。</strong></p>

<p>你要求的独立，不是消灭中央后建立一个有利于集体的共识机制，而是为了独立于中央形成一个独立主权国家。</p>

<p>即便其他地区会要求一个统一的宪政民主化国家，你的政治路线也会视之为敌人。</p>

<p>但你反对中央，独立后又会出现一个内部中央政府，那独立后政权的下辖市区要独立，又该怎么处理？</p>

<p>现实当中，国内并不认可为独立而独立，只会支持在一个市场和国家内进行改革的权力分配，一旦实现民选形成稳定政治习惯，架构就会落实。</p>

<p>现代已经有制度、社会基础形成一个改革后的分权社会，你不走捷径，说你反复造轮子有什么不愿意的，冤枉你了？</p>

<p>也即是说，哪怕有成熟且有广大群众基础支持的在统一框架内，进行地方分权的措施，你也不会接受。</p>

<p>因为你固执偏激地认为，只要存在中央政府就必然会出问题。</p>

<p>但中央政府不可能不存在，这是文明发展出来的客观结构而不是一时间主观设计出来的。</p>

<p>这就是你逻辑不自洽的所在。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“未来产业发展，会到达不改革连政府都难以运作的时候。”</strong></p>

<p><strong>邓动手前，不少人曾幼稚地想，时代在发展，社会在进步，经过了文革，CCP不会再这么干了。结果呢？高估中央的底线，损失的是鲜活的人命。我不希望未来有人天真地听信您在网上不负责任的言论而在跟新中央讨价还价的过程中丧命。</strong></p>

<p>我能从你这段话的误判当中，发现你钻牛角尖在哪。</p>

<p>你默认只要中央都会做一样的事，而忽略了中央只是一个客观机构。</p>

<p>威权主义者的中央，用打天下坐天下的思路执政，才会出现杀人的情况。</p>

<p>这是任何威权主义者上台都可以看得出来的，学生也好，还是民众也罢，普遍都看得出来。</p>

<p>而你逻辑里又默认人们普遍追求权力，却没有观察到生产力进步带来的社会结构变化，无法把两者产生联系，才得出一个人们普遍追求权力的极致这种错误判断。</p>

<p>然后就是立论错，步步错。</p>

<p>日本人可以跟中央政府讨价还价，但中国人不能跟中共的中央政府讨价还价。</p>

<p>根本区别在哪？</p>

<p>你默认人们都普遍追求权力的极致，也不承认生产力进步的社会变化。</p>

<p>也即等于不承认生产力进步后的社会当中，多数人并不谋求权力的极致，而是互相妥协出集体共识，不谋求威权主义下的打江山坐江山思维。</p>

<p>因为那样的思维在当代根本无法生存，也不符合现代经济学。</p>

<p>中共已经被这种思维拖累的财政出现困境，且不可逆。</p>

<p>他们有先发优势，能披着政府的外衣去进行资源征收，然后调用在自己需要的地方。</p>

<p>即便如此，也无法避免结构性危机。</p>

<p>这就是统治与管理的区别。</p>

<p>任何地区都不可能毫无任何组织力量自行起事，一旦你进行组织有了建立政权的能力，你能停留在地方政权本身而不是扩张到全国吗？</p>

<p>共识是组建政权的根基，否则连组织都无法建立，因为压根没人信奉的东西也不会有人付出汗水和努力。</p>

<p>你区分不出农业威权社会与现代自由化社会的差异，因此才会得出上去谁都一个样的这种逻辑。</p>

<p><strong>特别是CCP下台后人民普遍议会斗争经验趋近于零，一时间碰撞在一块，万一对民主失去信心，呼唤专政怎么办? 一个野心家掌控拥核中国，和一个野心家掌控没核武小国，哪个后果更严重可怕？</strong></p>

<p>我前面提到过很多次变量的引入，你始终不乐意，我也无可奈何。</p>

<p>但我还是要说。</p>

<p>什么是变量，变量就是社会的发展与进步。</p>

<p>十几亿人口的经济水平，发展到这个程度，只会进不会大规模倒退。</p>

<p>任何一个你认为的潜在野心家，他都只能也只会是一个人。</p>

<p>如果他想指挥其他人，他必须有名正言顺符合大众预期的行为。</p>

<p>威权社会与落后的社会结构，民众们对政治生态的表达和参与就会很少。</p>

<p>因为产业不够发达，社会上没有形成一批稳定有盈余能对时政有影响的阶级。</p>

<p>中国现在经济很发达，商品经济的发达也意味着对生活质量的追求。</p>

<p>城市资产阶级的兴起，决定了财政的走向，你越专制，你的组织结构越跟这个发展趋势扭着来。</p>

<p>结果就是社会上大多数持有资源的人或组织，不像你这一侧倾斜，因为你们的政治观念不同。</p>

<p>没有任何人一上来就可以呼风唤雨，国内这些大财团和城市中产，他们掌握了极大量的资源。</p>

<p>难道是甘心服从中共掠夺吗？不是，纯粹是因为中共在他们改革开放崛起前，就已经站稳脚跟，有先发优势持有军队。</p>

<p>并且在这个过程里不断消灭其他冒头的竞争者，避免这些城市资产阶级通过某些组织找到内战的代理人。</p>

<p>一个全球化的公司，必然也是分布在国内多处的，这一点多余城市阶级的白领和中产而言也迫切需要在大市场内获得机遇和生活便利。</p>

<p>这也是为什么，一个为独立而独立的路线，根本不会得到他们的支持。</p>

<p>而这些城市阶级，并不谋求权力的极致化，在他们支持下做大的存在，就必须靠拢这些人的政策。</p>

<p>但归根结底在于，物以类聚人以群分，有一样意识形态和观点的人会趋同走到一起。</p>

<p>当代高度发达的工业社会下，任何一个威权主义政权，每一个为了自身生存的操作，都会得罪于人，与社会发展的大方向互相抵触。</p>

<p>政治制度的结构来自于广大社会群众中是否有基础。</p>

<p>王侯将相还是独裁者都好，他们唯一可以无条件指挥的除了他们自己就没有其他人，任何组织都需要一套对内公开的意识形态路线图，人们认可才会为之工作，或者你能出钱也行。</p>

<p>但是如果与社会发展趋势相反，财政问题就会让这种威权组织结构无法生存，而哪些受益于分权制度的城市阶级，也只会支持与他们观点一致的人。</p>

<p>中共上台时，城市人口比例很低，工业化可以说对比人口规模就是为零，彻底的农业社会。</p>

<p>现代呢？中国是个高度工业化，生活水平大幅度提高，且城市居住人口占比为主，有诸多矛盾和社会结构问题的发展中国家。</p>

<p>人的意识形态和价值观取向，也是有趋势的，并不是一成不变。</p>

<p>农业社会的残留惯性，其体现就是中共这样的威权政权，以及现代一些人的威权思想，还有一些人会默认这个世界的交互就是以威权形式为主，这是一种误判。</p>

<p>未来当然会出现部分保守派和威权主义者试图继承中共政权，继续维持次威权的过渡。</p>

<p>从历史来看，虽然这样的过渡迟早会滑向民主化，但是对我来说，没有任何义务浪费自己一辈子傻等。</p>

<p>所以自由主义者积极推动与抓住机会，比威权主义者更早确立一个政权，更早一步完成社会转型，比什么都重要。</p>

<p>中国十几亿人，威权的惯性残留转变慢很正常，也无可避免，但也不代表就一定是威权主义者能赢，相反中共作为威权的极端，已经把火力和人们对这类政权的不满拉到极限。</p>

<p>因此宁可带着威权进行自由化，也比让威权主义者进行少许自由的威权化把所有人拖入泥坑更好，你所提的普京才是后者。</p>

<p>哪怕你想独立，也要拳头硬，不能自保你拿什么提意见？谁规定追求自由化就必须是软绵绵的。</p>

<p>能顺应社会需求，而不是把组织和个人的政治观念凌驾于实际需求之上，然后为了保护这个政治目标去与社会有抵触产生政治运动。</p>

<p>也才能避免权力的无限扩大，在当代民生和民众情绪取向下，不可能跳过一个组织抓起这份权力，如果不顺应社会趋势，它便没有支持的基本盘，如果顺应社会趋势，最终将实现改革。</p>

<p>中国的地理和人口分布，决定必然会有一超多强的格局，历史上反复验证了这件事，南北朝都没有形成能永久性对峙的基础，你可以搞地方自治，然后形成一个集体共识走向宪政，以民生和平为重点达成共识，进行地方分权时代，但如果你直接跳出法理掀桌子，客观上你又无法消灭这个“一超”，那就只有被消灭的份。</p>

<p>并且会挑起一个不信任的猜疑链，“一超”政权是否会担心有其他人有样学样试图掀桌子而进行打击，让原本的地方分权，因为某些人单推的独立路线而被收窄。</p>

<p>人类历史与经济、生产力是高度联系在一起的，现代中国比过去就是一个更少威权化的社会。</p>

<p>你总是认为不相干的，觉着是并行线，威权主义者总是会上台，而不会因为经济发展社会产生变化而减少，本身就是错误的，如果不相干，我们世世代代都应该是部落酋长的子民或者皇帝的臣子。</p>

<p>即便再上台，社会的经济与意识形态结构，最多支撑一代人，可为什么我们要浪费中共给的机会，傻等一代人浪费自己的一生？</p>

<p>历史上威权主义主导快速发展原始的经济时，都是野蛮生长的时代，等过渡了以后，经济开始要求细致和产业升级，民主化的要求就越来越多，社会运动也逐渐出现，这些都不是凭空冒出来的。</p>

<p>国家从来不是你想制造就出来的，要有群众基础，你都默认不存在什么燕人和吴人的受众基础，那么独立出来的就只是政治国家，而不是民族国家</p>

<p>相反，你要镇压民族国家的广大受众，才能保证自身政权的存续，而且你制造的麻烦已经出现了，不想被清算，只能持续压制，到头来反而是自己变成威权主义者。</p>

<p>也因为人人都是独立的个体，你认为的野心家们，想滥用核武器的结果，无论大国小国，最后都会被内部压力倒逼，共产党再威权，到毛泽东死后也必须对外开放改革不合理的地方。</p>

<p>人们不想要专政，所以专政是错误的，也是中共下台的历史趋势。</p>

<p>但不能因为人们不想要专政，你担心呼唤专政，就一步过度到人民群众的对立面，开始打算拆解一个民族国家，然后带来比专政更专政的统治，引起更多的社会矛盾和战争。</p>

<p>要是民众为了解决这种分裂去寻求专政呢？或者即便分裂了，也有威权主义者寻求从独立政权的内部专政，又如何避免。</p>

<p>专政要不得，挑起民族情绪更要不得。</p>

<p>未来中国在统一市场与国体下实行宪政和地方合理的自治，既然符合国族的民族情绪，也符合经济民生，更能避免各地潜在的战争。</p>

<p><strong>不好意思，的确是我当时没表达清楚，使您误解我了。吴国和燕国都是联邦制国家，各有联邦宪法法院，往上没有别的什么联邦法院。联盟不是联邦。不好意思。</strong></p>

<p>我不认为这是误解，我前面不是没有提到过联邦，但你给的反应仍然是基于你修正后的结果。</p>

<p>也即是说，你的逻辑无法内部解释哪怕是在吴国燕国内部为何存在联邦，如果吴国燕国内部能组建联邦，为什么吴国燕国本身不是大联邦的一部分。</p>

<p>这种无限细分，为什么细分到你希望建立的吴国燕国就不再适用了。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>有道理，我接受。</strong></p>

<p><strong>过度期间，获取选民资格：</strong></p>

<p><strong>1） 本地户籍</strong></p>

<p><strong>2） 本地房地产业主及家属</strong></p>

<p><strong>3） 注册在本地的公司法人及家属</strong></p>

<p><strong>4） 出生在本地人士</strong></p>

<p><strong>5） 在本地学习的未成年及其监护人</strong></p>

<p>​</p>

<p>1） 即是按照中共的户籍管理规划，然而中共通过户籍制度限制人口流动才形成了地区差异，继承户籍制度带来的差异并且默认其合理化，是一种对全国人口不公平的体现，也即对劳动力本身掠夺的承认。</p>

<p>2） 这又是一种筛选方式，那如果没有能力买房，长期租房和在本地劳动产生税金，缴纳社保等形式为本地提供贡献，突然被剥夺了合法公民身份，只挑选有能力买方的富裕人士，这种制度的公平性与合理性何在？</p>

<p>而且最主要的是，似乎我说了你才想到给有本地房产的外地人一个身份，那在此之前是不是连这一点都默认不需要管。</p>

<p>接下来又该怎么处理事实的本地居民，而不是通过财产与户籍制这样的贵族身份划分的本地公民。</p>

<p>3） 同上，也即是说，没有在本地有资本注册公司的合法国民，就会被排除在你这套体系外，是否这个体系跟上面一样只接纳有房有公司的有钱人，从而试图排挤那些为本地劳动买不起房的基层人士，他们才是占比绝大多数的外来人口。</p>

<p>能在本地买房和开公司的外地户籍，占比能超过5%吗？</p>

<p>4） 根据现在的制度，父母原籍即子女原籍，你只能从父母原籍出发，而无法判定是否在本地出生，到时候相关资料都拿不到。</p>

<p>5） 如果根据传统的移民规则，对直系亲属的申请条例，这个范围必须扩大，并且逻辑上这是一种对年轻人口的纳用</p>

<p>综上所述你给的这一系列针对有资产、房产、年轻人口，基于中共法理制度下产生的人口政策，完全没有一处涵盖到没有房产、没有公司、没有子女或子女已成年的外来人口，而这群基层劳动者占比绝大部分。</p>

<p>基于户籍本身就是一种无视合理性的存在，给有房产、资产、监护权的人身份，是基本义务，所以我不视之为一种深入探讨，而是把基本的东西才刚刚补全，是分内的基本义务。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>吴国允许多重国籍。原共和国公民（包含港澳台）自由流动，其余外国公民落地签，均享受国民同等待遇，除了买房。只有公民才能买房。各城市移民局依据本地情况自行决定入籍条件。国家不在外设使领馆，节省经费。</strong></p>

<p>所以你的意思是，在你所谓的吴国成为事实居民十几年，但因为没房子、无儿女无资产，只是租房当廉价劳动力，就自动失去共和国原有赋予的法定权力，并且这样的人在本地人口里占了大部分？</p>

<p>那么他为什么作为大多数，要支持这种不利于他自身的政策。</p>

<p>我前面有给你看过人口比例，某些城市这样的外来人口占了相当大比例的多数。比如东莞。</p>

<p>因为无论你怎么分，本国国民永远是与另外一个主权国家有实质性的区别，而这种实质性的区别在此之前并不存在，是你硬生生建立起来的差异化，怎么从民众支持角度的合理性与法理上去解释。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>数量多就不叫核心了。真真正正五月四号北京那天的领头羊哪里有那么多人？</strong></p>

<p>所以你的逻辑就是五月四号当天发生的一件事，而不是一整个全国性的文化和精神革新运动？</p>

<p>即便按照你的说法，五四运动本身也是受新青年以及背后李大钊、陈独秀等人影响，包括那些五四当天在北京的学生领袖，其中很多人都参与到后来的中共建设当中。</p>

<p>为什么故意忽视了这些人的存在，以及忽视了李大钊陈独秀这些人的主导性？</p>

<p>到底五四运动是只是一次五四当天的事件，还是一次全国性的文化和精神革新运动，这难道不是一个验证历史了解程度的分水岭吗？还用明说吗。</p>

<p>为什么要加一个从未否认过，陈炯明并没有打算放弃统一，你否认从何而来我不是很理解。</p>

<p>陈炯明与孙中山主要集中在北伐的进度与方法上，而不是在于政权的统一与否上。</p>

<p>联省自治本质是联邦化，仍然在地方分权概念上，你提倡的是各省区域建立主权国家。</p>

<p>陈炯明提出的也是省宪法，包括章太炎等提出联省自治的本意，就是联邦化中国，而不是拆分成一个个主权国家。</p>

<p>陈炯明也并非反对孙中山统一，而是主张方法有不同，政治上的法统路线没矛盾。</p>

<p>清末的北洋时期，各省事实上处于自治状态，并且也提出了大量的省宪法来作为临时法理来源。</p>

<p>北伐形成一个核心政权后，各地仍然以联省自治的基础进行管理，一直到抗日战争与内战，尤其是中共建立政权后，意识形态矛盾导致这种空间逐渐减少。</p>

<p><strong>寻求外部支援，无可厚非。我是认可的。奇怪的是，明明都是大一统主义者，为什么孙中山和冯玉祥甘愿接受苏联黑钱，收容CCP？极权主义苏联和威权主义日俄性质全然不同。</strong></p>

<p>原因很简单，苏联接壤中国，有强烈的地缘政治需求，并且是接壤中国的国家里最强的，美国英国如果是最大的接陆国家，中国只会更早民主化。</p>

<p>许多军阀都与苏联有接触，包括陈炯明，只是意识形态和政治利益无法统一而已。</p>

<p>并且这些人，包括陈炯明，提倡的都是大一统，他们不反对中华法理建立统一政权，主张的是联省自治。</p>

<p>有人反对大一统，是因为跟鲁迅开天窗一样，想开天窗让中国实现分权和地方制衡，但有威权主义者坚持不愿意，那就直接拆屋顶，去寻求从中华法理彻底独立，来逼人接受联邦化的观点。</p>

<p>你反对的是中华法理本身，并不是拆屋效应逼人退而求其次从大一统寻联邦化的道路，只是纯粹的否定中华法理，从历史来看，你的观点不但无法成功，也找不到近似的盟友。</p>

<p>这一点我们是必须搞清楚的。</p>

<p>中华的法理法统是客观存在的，在这法理范围下的任何分权都是合理的。</p>

<p>但是拆分中华法理本身，去建立主权国家与文化民族，没有市场不说，也不与历史上追求联省自治的统一目的相符。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>为什么重复我的观点？欣赏军阀的下限，鄙视拉低下限的孙中山，不管他是不是共和主义者。哪怕他支持广东独立，他也不对。</strong></p>

<p>因为孙中山没有拉低下限，威权社会就必然出现训政的政党进行统一，而在这样一个威权社会背景下，又没有沦落到跟古代一样的政治斗争恶化到不死不休，是时代进步的体现。</p>

<p>你用未来的逻辑，去硬套孙中山身上说他搞统一是拉低下限，那我好奇问你，凭什么觉得当时社会有基础（哪怕现在和可见未来都没人会广泛支持你），就认为孙中山所处时代的反应是违背某些原则拉低下限的？</p>

<p>你不能在幻想当中建立乌托邦，就跟你没法在中国古代推行共和制。</p>

<p>制度的基础和形成是社会，中国当时的社会基础和构成，只会演化出威权政党，而孙中山的威权训政比后来蒋介石的更好，矛盾性更低，蒋介石的又比中共的更好。</p>

<p>皆因在乱世当中，这就是生存之道，因此演化出了一个极端威权的路线。</p>

<p>恶化政治环境的是外部压力以及内部没有工业化社会带来的生产基础。</p>

<p>各地军阀都在互相吞并，宋教仁想从上往下着手，难道军阀就甘心听命？法律程序是大家遵守才有效的。</p>

<p>袁世凯不管你，你有什么办法？二次革命谁逼出来的，是孙中山么，不是，你有选择余地，才能从顶层架构去设计制度，没有选择余地，就看谁拳头硬，这种环境恶化的滑坡，是清朝自己造成的。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>不符合个人路线的就是坏人？不能这么说吧。宋教仁私德还可以，而且法学素养好，尊重议会斗争，我是佩服的。我称赞您聪明，不妨碍批判您自以为正确的大一统叙事观。</strong></p>

<p>宋教仁与我政治路线一致，这些人都是主张大一统本身，你是反对统一这个事实，而不是追求联邦化和全国宪政议会。</p>

<p>而在我看来，如果一个人的政治路线在明知道在非必要的情况下会引发大量社会动荡与冲突，他必须审视自己的方法可行性与现实基础。</p>

<p>希特勒按这个标准算，个人私德也不错，但他的政治主张，有没有能与现实世界和平共存的方案？没有。</p>

<p>如果我的方案和路线对现实世界可能造成更多的负面影响，我宁可去修改它。</p>

<p>但你不同，你是为了独立而独立，如果独立本身造成一系列社会问题和冲突，你也会为了反对大一统而坚持推行独立，而你知道推行带来的问题和后果严重性，你也要坚持到底，这是你政治上的问题。</p>

<p>本质就是跟农业社会主义一样，把一切资产阶级和地主阶级等叙事换成了大一统叙事观。</p>

<p>而这样的政治观念，缺乏落实空间，一旦获得了政权，并且实践后得罪人，有人反对你（一个省至少20-30%的外来人口且不符合你上述合法公民的获取资格），你为了自保就必须进一步集权。</p>

<p>你能为这个独立坚持到这，就肯定也不会因为别人反对就放弃，否则你现在就该放弃了。</p>

<p>最后就必然走上一个为了维护自身不切实际的政治路线，而不断重复步步错的困境。</p>

<p>任何事都是要顺从社会趋势，如果社会趋势人人喊独立建国，我没什么好反对的，而且还要支持。</p>

<p>可是社会上有哪个是要喊着建立燕国吴国，没有共识，你想建立政权，除了你幻想会出现以外，唯一方法就是靠一个强而有力的组织拥兵自重建国。</p>

<p>然后就重复上述所说。</p>

<p>最主要的是，我不认为你不清楚这个事实，也就是说我很清楚你想的明白，了解到这些问题，但你还是要坚持，这就是“恶”的所在。</p>

<p>谈政治，做键政，出发点不应该是为了个人政治观念，个人观念要依托于大众实际需求。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>何必如此偏激，党同伐异？不过，宋教仁支持分享大量权力给地方吗？那个好像是胡汉民吧。</strong></p>

<p>你要非这么说，那政治的最原始本质就是党同伐异，不是人人当好好先生。</p>

<p>任何民主制国家你看哪个政治上不是党同伐异，民主党和共和党打的厉害不厉害？</p>

<p>党同伐异形成公开公平的竞争，才是民主制互相制衡的要害。</p>

<p>为什么？因为执行决策要么做这个，要么做哪个，一条道没办法南北皆走，所以是轮流执政。</p>

<p>这是个逻辑问题，不是想不想，全世界任何民主制国家，政策、执政与席位都只能有一条决策线实际被执行，不能说两个政治观念完全不同的人，平分所有岗位，这样现实社会怎么治理。</p>

<p>但是，党同伐异的下限在哪，在大家要在一个集体框架内，尊重宪法，不让人有掀桌子的胆子。</p>

<p>就算人人都当好好先生，总要挑一种观点来执行吧？</p>

<p>我的观点执行不好，我下台，你上去。</p>

<p>你不行了，选民让你下来，我再上去。</p>

<p>这是民主。</p>

<p>你说我当的不好，我要独立了，这是掀桌子。</p>

<p>如果你是不基于任何法理，纯粹靠暴力独立，就会回到上面所说的猜疑链，一旦执行错误，有人普遍反对独立，最后你就会要么放弃独立，要么对内镇压。</p>

<p>所以现代社会法理共识很重要，没有的话会有源源不绝的人来反对你。</p>

<p>你只能接受，或者不接受对着干。</p>

<p>宋教仁希望省长民选已是表态，而谈这个话题多数没必要，因为从帝制突然过渡到共和制，没人知道什么更适合中国，这些人都有过摇摆，并且都比帝制更向地方分权与妥协。</p>

<p>区别是，制度的设计者，能不能最后成为制度的执行者，而袁世凯这种执行者一旦掀桌子为了个人政治理念，社会是否有反制措施。</p>

<p>没有法律程序和政治氛围，结果就是军阀混战、府院之争。</p>

<p>说白了，这些所谓的绝密情报就是建立政权后政治宣传的一部分。</p>

<p>你要是了解老一辈党员，在当时改革开放建政化和文革前，都会知道政府职务的实效性，这是独立于政治身份的，这也是为什么六四期间有人提议让万里回来召开人大。</p>

<p>为什么六四是政变？因为不符合程序。</p>

<p>中共自身都在走这个程序，即便很多时候只是过场，区别是政党干预的权力与深度。</p>

<p>韩国第一共和国到第六共和国，都始终是一个政权和国家，政党独大和控制，难道因为几代独裁专政的威权政府，所以过渡到民主化以后，政府人员原地融化了？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>古今中外教导国民历史的方式，与历史研究不同，其实很幼稚，就是讲故事，好人坏人，主角配角。中国民主党派和无党派人士的高层和秘书处相当多人士不是双重党员就是同情者，内战时执行统战部命令，不骂毛和土改，专骂蒋和金圆券。这算好人？建国后他们的势力小到斯大林一死就被扫出国务院，长期被边缘化，文革时还被取缔。这算主角？</strong></p>

<p><strong>国体不改，广大中小学生在言论自由下将了解到前苏联资助了CCP，养大了民主党派和部分无党派人士，缔造共和国，培养了开国所有军官，党魁是反人类罪犯，亲自宣布国家成立并任元首。这些才是真相。面对真相，您妄图通过三寸不烂之舌将他们描绘成仿佛有自主能力的政治柱石，禁不起推敲，骗不了习惯上网查资料的 woke 同学们。</strong></p>

<p>所以你自己已经帮我证实了一点，你明确知道共和国与中共不是绝对一体的，这里你自己都明确说了民主党派和无党派人士是被边缘化，而之前还当他们不存在，这说明什么，说明你心里有数也很清楚。</p>

<p>也即是说，中共建立共和国的开端，本身就是一超多强形式下组建的联合政府，这是法理认同的来源，并且也是早期这些第三方势力资源倾斜的根本所在。</p>

<p>大家都比烂，国民党当时都没比过中共，摇摆的第三方用脚投票，怪谁？</p>

<p>中共消化第三方势力，一直到七十年代文革鼎盛时期才大致完成，并且始终没有办法彻底摆脱统战体系，仍然要对国内不同的利益派系妥协，因为本身就不是所有利益派系都会并入中共内部。</p>

<p>更别提中共自身都不是铁板一块。</p>

<p>政治运动一结束，改革开放后，第三方势力又开始高度参与政治建设，只是以党外或者非公职身份施加影响，现在政协开给谁的？</p>

<p>宋庆龄和荣毅仁出来政府要职，霍英东等人能干预决策层，这都是摆在面前的事实。</p>

<p>你读史钻牛角尖的一个地方，就是忽略了本来这些人就是你中有我，我中有你，何香凝是明确的第三方派别，儿子也继承了相当部分资源，但是仍然是以中共党员身份活跃在历史和政府内部。</p>

<p>中共五老，董必武、吴玉章、林伯渠之类，实际都是孙中山早期同盟会反清人士，甚至有保路运动。</p>

<p>本身就是清末反清势力崛起后的派系分裂，国民党与中共也是同一个本土势力分裂出来的。</p>

<p>朱德更是同盟会出身，也是孙中山派系顾品珍的嫡系，甚至一度有机会成为军阀混战里的其中一支，只不过打不过唐继尧，后来也没有接受孙中山资助。</p>

<p>毛泽东论起步，并不比这些人早，只是在后续的政治斗争和外部压力下，不断做出正确选择成为党魁。</p>

<p>但凡你了解清末政治生态的复杂性，接触到的人物之多，顺着脉络看，就会发现这群人实际都是来自于清末反清势力，区别是后来分裂成不同派系，然后又被国共两党整合。</p>

<p>而不是什么苏联有能力莫名其妙跑来虚空建立起一个体系，然后不断颠覆所谓的合法政府。</p>

<p>而是清末同盟会与北洋为首的两大派别，在经过一系列斗争后，同盟会派系发现斗争不过北洋派系，开始转而引入苏联支援。</p>

<p>意识形态当时本身就开始逐渐分左右，而苏联两者都有扶持，并不是单纯意识形态输出。</p>

<p>你还停留在：</p>

<p><strong>苏联资助了CCP，养大了民主党派和部分无党派人士，缔造共和国，培养了开国所有军官，党魁是反人类罪犯，亲自宣布国家成立并任元首。这些才是真相。</strong></p>

<p>你没有构架一个基本认知，就是清末以来，左右的思潮冲突已经复现，在苏联干预之前，苏联成立之前，左派思潮就已经在社会上有很大的吸引力，只不过被反清和反帝制的浪潮盖过，到五四后的二十年代早期开始全面爆发。</p>

<p>蒋介石都把儿子送到苏联，这是一种社会风气，留苏是浪潮，区别在于留苏回来后的方向选择，中共单独培育干部，他不把人往莫斯科送还能全送美国吗？</p>

<p>似乎你的视角还只是，外来的势力扶持了一个中共，然后这个代理人政党建立了一个共和国，而实际情况是反清势力分裂左右派后，左派形成了共产党，右派形成了国民党，他们的人才库都是共享的，路径也相同。</p>

<p>都是从孙中山的训政体系里分裂出来，问题就出在训政期间，国共两党对包容的阶级问题产生不可逆的分歧，关键就在于扶助农工和小资产阶级的差异上。</p>

<p>孙中山走的是包容路线：</p>

<blockquote>

<p>尤其是<strong>我们主张解决民生问题的方法，不是先提出一种毫不合时用的剧烈办法，再等到实业发达以求适用</strong></p>

<p><strong>我不明白为什么您用这个词。提胡赵万是为了说，在追求大一统道路上，统治阶级内部素质高于平均水准混不下去，掌不了权。在某种意义上，我在夸您的偶像。</strong></p>

<p>我没提的东西，你自己能用出来，就起码应该明白其他人能听得出来阴阳怪气和好赖话和用词用意，这三者具体是什么你应该仔细品，你看事物和对人的评价基准出发点就有问题，我没义务迁就你，就跟你对孙中山的评价一样，本质都是在服务于你自己的政治立场。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>胡从小参与土改，大人杀地主，红小鬼旁边补刀。经过长征抢过粮，延安四大整人王之一。赵在老家和广东土改作风极其血腥，大跃进为了凸显自己向中央提醒农民藏粮。万里个人生活不正常。</strong></p>

<p>胡耀邦小时候自己老师被打成AB团被杀，自己差点因为AB团被杀，延安整风自己老婆李昭都差点被搞死，整风时期做试验，找人吓唬一下，发现有人认了，反应过来有不对劲地方，后面政治任务摊派给他，推不掉的都尽可能消极从轻处理，被批糊涂主义。</p>

<p>你要说他办事积极，这是性格上的，跟赵紫阳号召反瞒产一样，后来回过味了都不积极主张自己原来的路线，甚至政治上完全相反。</p>

<p>本身拿来当话题输出的，一是毛左针对改革开放，二就是传这些东西深究很多都无法立论的人，其动机我这里就不先谈，下一段立刻可以表出来，我都能猜到你后面说什么。</p>

<p>再有看之前蒋介石堡垒战术出处，德国军事顾问就德国军事顾问，非要说： 德意志普鲁士容克阶级退休军阀 Von Schlecht 指点的。</p>

<p>不明白掉哪门子的书袋，而且还说的不准确，之前就想吐槽这点，见微知著，你到底对这个情况从什么角度给的判断，准确不准确，是不是主流，胡耀邦死敌说他不整人，那整风里他到底是公事公办，还是有私人目的的针对谁？不言而喻。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>我什么时候说过政治必须洁白无暇？这个帽子扣得没有技术含量。污点归污点，政绩归政绩。他们审时度势，懂得现代化要点，是很厉害的政治家。但爬到他们那个位置的匪徒，血债累累，过分夸赞，对冤魂不公平。实事求是就好，不用偶像崇拜。</strong></p>

<p>果然是吧，我前面就说了，拿来话题当输出的，一是毛左诘难改革开放，二是什么？</p>

<p>二就是喜欢拿来当支点进行输出，试图瓦解历史叙事体系的人。</p>

<p>推特和某些地方很流行，一是姨学，二是希望完全跳出中共客观存在历史叙事的群体。</p>

<p>本质上这些人都是有趋同迹象，并没有真正意义上做到实事求是，史料问题都未必过关，如果孤证不立，那何来许多无法验证的说法。</p>

<p>比如最经典的，赵紫阳反瞒产，然后上升到是大跃进主要推手等一系列荒谬的论调。</p>

<p>说白了，主张这些观点的人，要的不是为受影响的人伸冤，而是以此作为政治攻击的话题。</p>

<p>但深究呢？我们会发现，赵紫阳的确是提出反瞒产，但在其位谋其职，真正的问题是毛泽东自己把这份报告扩大来执行推广，所以赵紫阳就莫名其妙一跃成为大跃进的主要推手了。</p>

<p>尤其是这类群体里，我最多听到的一句话就是“<strong>爬到他们那个位置的匪徒“</strong>，之类的说法，传的最多的是什么，胡耀邦靠延安整风、反右上位当打手。</p>

<p>刘宾雁当时反右被胡耀邦督办， 刘宾雁到最后还为胡耀邦说好话，自己亲自说当时胡耀邦为反右做了多大缓冲，那这些都不考虑，何来的实事求是。</p>

<p>刘仲敬就是最不爱谈史料，甚至批沈志华等，然后一系列的话术体系是认为中共是苏联扶持的，并且毛泽东是石敬瑭，认为沈志华在回避一系列说法，很多人都有高度趋同的描述，那基本上我就清楚大概怎么回事了。</p>

<p>倒不如反问一下，他们在那个位置，之所以不会成为被责难的主流，因为在其位谋其事，有什么就做什么，毛泽东要反右，有你不推的余地吗？这是个体制问题，而不是个人选择问题，所以当个人决定政治走向时，问题才会归结到更高层有决策权的人身上。</p>

<p>也即是说，集体趋势是制度问题，个人选择是个人反思，说的好像胡赵这些人做了很多坏事，主观上刻意整死害死了很多人，那他们后来的行为都是自己反对自己，党内外的同僚风评都是假的么？显然不是，他们反对自己是最激烈的。</p>

<p>所以没有什么过分夸赞，而是中国历史叙事主体早就接受了中共这个政权的客观实际存在，这才是实事求是，而不是非要被说成偶像崇拜。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>不是，社会并没分裂，行政线的治理整顿运动已然开始，军区运行也很稳定。乱只是干部队伍内部人事关系混乱不堪，政权整体对外还是高压的。</strong></p>

<p>别社会并没分裂了，文革末期，毛泽东没死时就已经有公开反文革和各类反文革的内容被流传或贴出来，四五运动和南京反文革都是类似例子。</p>

<p>民间治安也十分不稳，出现了大量的地方团体组建政党、邪教、组织的情况，并且货币问题迟迟没有得到解决，地方机关陷入了无组织发展的状态。</p>

<p>军队的资源供给已经不能良好维持，到八十年代快速进行了待遇改善。</p>

<p>你的错觉是在于因为后面改革开放经济好转，所以没发生的东西就没有状况出现，那么不如反推，为什么被迫改革开放，连毛泽东嫡系都意识到要改革。</p>

<p>这是基本逻辑问题，不赘述。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>顺着您这句原创的抖机灵话往下说，邓一个风烛残年的老矮子党员，都能拯救濒临崩溃的独裁政权并以一手之力埋葬自由化风气和人才仕途，那说明您坚持大一统下的民主方案没戏。</strong></p>

<p>趋势在我们这面，人是一个观察历史窗口期非常短的单位。</p>

<p>所以为什么说你意识不到全局状况和历史趋势，不能引入变量来观察社会发展。</p>

<p>一旦社会的底层结构和生产力秩序到了一定程度，制度和观念的变革就是不可逆的。</p>

<p>邓可以压制，是因为社会基础不存在，只有少数知识分子形成了自由化的声音，而社会无实际的需求，或者说这种需求本身还没到必不可少的程度。</p>

<p>你在这种地方判断错误，就能以小见大，让人搞清楚为什么你不理解可以落成大一统下的民主方案。</p>

<p>因为你根本就没搞清楚社会为什么会转型成民主化，所以才有钻牛角尖与现实实际需求不符的情况。</p>

<p><strong>“苏联解体后，苏联势力范围内，原本的国家被解放出来，共产党失去执政地位，政权直接改组成一个新国家。”</strong></p>

<p>苏联解体后原卫星政权改组新国家，没关系。抛弃苏联资助建立的中华人民共和国，不行。双标？！</p>

<p>苏联是一个政治性联盟政权，中国是一个法理统一的主权国家概念。</p>

<p>苏联加盟国本身就有退出的法律权力，有法理依据。</p>

<p>中国是一个概念，你要么靠暴力逼他人承认，要么靠超能力抹除他人对某块土地应该属于中国法理的认知。</p>

<p>所以从这点上能看出你对何谓中国，是没什么具体认知的。</p>

<p>而且还停留在经典的苏联资助建立中华人民共和国的逻辑上，跟上述所说一样，没跳出框架，想获取一个法理，结果还是要找中国自身来要。</p>

<p>所以是双标吗？难道不是基于你对基本事物认知都出现偏差，我还需要照顾你的感受不说的那么直白才会有这种情况？</p>

<p><strong>为什么不接受？现代国民国家领土统一加上地方自治，在绝对意义上没人不赞同。</strong></p>

<p>但首先你就是不接受的那个，你本质是为了追求独立而独立。</p>

<p>因为这个语境下我们都知道在谈中国，如果接受了，你独立的立场何在，你自己在下面也说了前置条件是中国。</p>

<p>也就是说，你的立论，把中国人这种存在，跟其他地区人类是区分开的。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>本人政见的前置条件是中国，不是别处。如您所言，地理环境使统治者天然倾向闭塞政策，排斥向外界开放，哪怕在今天，CCP的干部已然接触到现代文明的情况下。历史惯性之强，可见一斑。矫枉应过正，故提倡独立。</strong></p>

<p>但你不可能分不出农业社会的政治构成，以及工业社会的政治构成。</p>

<p>追求矫枉过正，以国民利益为牺牲去实现个人政治远景，本身就是一种幼稚的做法。</p>

<p>或者说你根本没有，也不愿意引入变量，即便我帮你引入以后，你也不愿意接受变量的存在是观察没有充分的主要原因，因此走了死胡同。</p>

<p>比如，农业社会的威权成分更高，但工业社会下，人就是人，没有本质区别，社会会随着构成改变而形成现代化的民主国家。</p>

<p>但你不愿意接受这个客观规律，也即是一种对客观现象的否定。</p>

<p>认为只有矫枉过正才能得到解决，这就是典型钻牛角尖，</p>

<p>你说CCP干部接触到现代文明就必须瞬间开放达到你的政治要求，就跟你说大韩民国的独裁政权，接触到美国以后就必须立刻达到现代韩国民主化一样。</p>

<p>只是你单方面的要求，而不符合客观实际规律。</p>

<p>正常人知道社会发展趋势后，下台的是中共。</p>

<p>如果谈条件，对你让步，最多共和国换个名字。</p>

<p>你不接受一切温和相对有讨论空间的区域，只接受中国必须各地裂解成没有来由的燕国吴国，并且只以该目标为结果。</p>

<p>从中引入变量解释也不管不顾，那么从这里可以推导出一种逻辑来判断。</p>

<p>可能都谈不上是拆屋效应，拆屋是你的根本目的，用拆屋效应来打掩护才是真。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>咱们的分歧主要在于对中国的定性。中国是多民族ethnicity，多语言，前民主化的帝国。帝国是捏合起来的政治国家，而中华国族nation则是瞎编的大杂烩。不强推普通话，彼此很难交流。类似人类历史上其它帝国（古罗马/奥斯曼/沙俄/墨西哥/奥匈/西欧和日本殖民帝国），转为国民国家nation-state是无法保持领土完整的。因为帝国各地区生活水平天差地别，生产力越是进步，富庶地区越想离开，而民风彪悍的老少边穷也不愿再受剪刀差的剥削。</strong></p>

<p><strong>帝国若是解体成若干小型国民国家，这些内部文化更融洽的小国这辈子单独民主转型的概率更大。吴国内民俗饮食语言相似，国族成立。</strong></p>

<p>分歧在于，你会拿现实根本说不通的主观表达作为一种客观定义。</p>

<p>比如中国是捏合起来的政治国家，还停留在中国是个奥斯曼式，多民族有自己生存固定的领土与独特文化社群的政治实体。</p>

<p>吴国没有所谓的民族、文化，都只是汉民族的地缘文化分支，这是已有且被广发接受的事实。</p>

<p>所以我建议不要学某人一样凭空造民族，你替江浙人民创造，他们是不会承认的。</p>

<p>也即是说，你不能用只存在于极少数人中的极少数人的小圈子自嗨的观念，套用在客观现实绝大多数人的观念上去做解释。</p>

<p>本质上你其实也是在避谈现在汉民族文化认同，汉语的流行程度等，官话推行历来有之，根本不是强推普通话的结果。</p>

<p>假设一个地区对政权高度不认同，有非常独立的民族和国家认同感，就会不断反抗来自外部的压力，然后像你说的一样真正意义上的政治国家，会伴随核心统治区的衰落而分崩离析。</p>

<p>但中国并不是罗马，也不是奥斯曼，并不存在多个民族原本就分治不同地区，有很大差异且文化冲突的情况。</p>

<p>如果有一个客观的民族主体，有非常强烈的意愿与反抗行动，试图从政治中国里独立，那么你的论述才成立。</p>

<p>否则，没有的东西，你不能凭空造出来假设他有，然后立靶子打。</p>

<p>而且，只有这种异民族不愿意充当劳动力的前提下，反对剪刀差才有价值，贫困地区的异民族才想积极尽快独立。</p>

<p>同民族的状况下，边远地区只想在人口流动政策结束后，尽快能到更好的地方生存。</p>

<p>而你凭空没有任何民族基础、法理依据造出来的国境线，只会阻碍他们追求更好的生活。</p>

<p>异民族独立是因为剪刀差来自于不同民族之间的剥削，对他们来说，生活社区与族群文化本身就有差异，交流困难且无法互相融入。</p>

<p>但在国内，我看不出山西人河南人去江苏浙江有什么压力，相反，吴国利用剥削剪刀差剥削边远地区人口发展起来，却不愿意让他们获得合法公民身份，会引起众怒，道义上也不公平。</p>

<p><strong>秦以降便是中央权威所覆盖处严格控制到户。乡村大宗族，至少在北方内陆，自南宋起愈发减少，经常遭受打压。部分乡绅与官员沾亲带故，朝廷便予以地位，让其负责宣传教化，但平常必须接受胥吏巡视驯服，参与横征暴敛，摊派徭役，与村民对立，导致自治空间不大。清廷更是登封造极，州县佐杂官分辖乡村，形成数以千计居县城之下的固定的正式区划体系。耶鲁教授 Mattingly 的“The Art of Political Control in China”阐明二十一世纪CCP看似现代化的网格化管理其实和晚清社会管控制度别无二致。</strong></p>

<p>古代社会根本不具备对所有地方严格控制到户的能力，这是一个基本常识，或者说不是历史常识，而是生活常识。</p>

<p>直到现代科技联网，都依然无法避免有严重遗漏现象，古代社会更是长期实行郡国并行制度，你对中国历史的了解似乎很有限，就好比我说郡县制，六国都实行，然后呢？这种地方一抓一个准，完全没融会贯通，只能自己捏书袋。</p>

<p>汉代实行郡国并行，地方治理由国进行统治，封邑长期实行，宗族管理就是皇权节约行政成本的事实体现，以汉末为例，地方宗族数百到数千偏安一隅，这些人的管理都被集中在地方势力受伤，或以豪族，或以士人名义。</p>

<p>并且战乱过后，有大量的人逃避徭役征发，导致名义户籍数字大幅度减少。</p>

<p>类似的社会管理模式，一直沿用度过这个南北朝时期，地方大族作为民户的庇护，用以减少徭役摊派或者税务征收。</p>

<p>这些地方势力，事实上就是自治主体，到了明代集权的一个新巅峰，其户籍制度，尤其是军户的卫所制更是无法维系，导致多户出一人，行使顶替的情况出现，中央政府根本不管，只要你能按户出够人就行，至于有这些户籍身份的地方大族具体派谁去无所谓。</p>

<p>如果对明代历史有基本了解，都应该清楚明末根本无法进行有效税收，并且出现了两次困难，以此是张居正改革前，税金甚至无法用稳定媒介征缴，以此是万历到崇祯时期，粮饷无法有效通过税收征集，地方根本无视朝廷的直接政令，且上缴时又形成阻碍。</p>

<p>你把实际负责地方行政自治管理的实体视为中央威权的一部分，本身就是完全错误的，他们执行是因为在中央政权的覆盖下，不可能不服从，但不意味着中央政令下达即在当地有效实施，否则明朝不会收不上税金。</p>

<p>真正意义上到巅峰是通过工业技术与资金的当代，这是一种因技术与环境带来的时效性最优解，而时效性一定过了，就会出现动荡与不稳定，也即民主化。</p>

<p>威权没有滥用，本质并没有区别，执行的不同，不代表威权就不是威权，威权只是权力形式与其运作的体现。</p>

<p><strong>而中华帝国的土壤恰恰轻视法统，偏爱僭主，鼓励其无所不用其极，以统一为名守护王土。北洋政府实行威权统治，地方自治，纷纷展现独立倾向，袁世凯立马化身僭主称帝，以保统一。</strong></p>

<p>统一是客观事实，也是普遍的国族情绪。</p>

<p>从过去民间就有家国统一，这种法理认可是非常普遍的，因为历代都不缺乏这类的文学创作可以反应民间的观点。</p>

<p>最典型的有南宋，对秦桧的愤怒，对岳飞北伐的肯定，对辽金元南下时造成的冲突态度区别，更别提后来明朝建立政权号召人心的口号，再到明末、清末，尤其是同盟会等明确的民族主义口号是驱逐鞑虏。</p>

<p>华夷之辩的意识形成与普及，以及中国概念的诞生，都决定了地区意识的崛起，这种意识是以华夷之辩为主体继续延伸变体，你主张说中共是苏联资助建立共和国，本身也是这种意识的一个延伸。</p>

<p>陈炯明主张通过联省自治，形成稳定的趋势，但实际情况是所有人都在军备竞赛应对即将到来的战争，尤其是对外的。</p>

<p>在这一点上的事实，把你想象希望看到的各地联省自治形成稳定局面否定了。</p>

<p>孙中山的训政思路，就是通过形成主干政府，实现名义全国统一，然后进行训政期间建立各地自治与工业基础，形成社会事实，最后宪政达成省份自治。</p>

<p>从结果来看，孙中山的主张是正确的，如果联省自治，可以参考蒋介石在中原大战后，无法控制军阀的问题，直接导致抗日或剿共失利。</p>

<p>蒋介石在此前也未曾真正实权控制全国，反而是抗日战争让蒋介石通过军事手段逐渐获得了各地控制权。</p>

<p>而当时背景，就是内外交困，农业社会背景下，集中权力获得最大效率。</p>

<p>社会的基础便是如此，哪怕蒋介石在台湾推行新政，也是持续到台湾接近发达国家的边缘才有社会基础进行转型。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>结果几十年后，后者布的局，定的法，均被其政敌传人取消，二十大更违反斗而不破的规矩，公然掳走前党魁，只因他容许门徒召开十万人大会并派遣空军大佬陪同总理去深圳示威。</strong></p>

<p><strong>任何政权的基础是枪杆子，枪杆子的态度看尉官和军士长。习成功连任，说明强力部门大多数冥顽不灵，对本已薄弱得可怜的法统不屑一顾。虽然独裁神经衰弱不少（谁也无法否认，杀的人确实越来越少），这些中国顶层军政要人，连带他们从小所浸淫的帝制僭主思想，不会因为CCP下台就原地蒸发消失。</strong></p>

<p>决定社会基础的是经济形态，中共坚决开倒车就是因为到了他们的生死存亡关键时期，形成了一种不死不休的零和竞争状态。</p>

<p>再者，中共是党指挥权，而不是枪指挥党，军队并不具备独立政变去阻碍政党内部事务的空间，也即是说军队本身内部的政治结构与往来也是散沙化的。</p>

<p>而且你说从小浸淫，那现在全国又有多少人是从小就有的威权主义观念。</p>

<p>即便工业化进步，还是有很多人是威权主义者，那独立出去后，是否还会变成地方独裁。</p>

<p>这些人也不会原地消失，你怎么确保不被威权主义者夺权。</p>

<p>道路不给出来，还提出一个毫无民众共识基础的观念，凭空硬造，若国内舆论以统一为共识，争夺是威权化或宪政自治体制，这时候你跳出来说独立，如果说你也是希望宪政民主化阵营的一部分，那算不算拖后腿的队友。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>物质影响意识，意识反作用于环境，哪怕拖延，阻碍发展，无聊地站在历史对立面，他们也坚持僭主统治，多一天赚一天；老百姓，则度日如年。</strong></p>

<p>不存在坚持的余地，按趋势发展下去，只会进入威权主义者的残余与保守派联合，与追求宪政和权力下放的自由化中间道路，在统一的基本共识下进入竞争。</p>

<p>即便再快，这个加速也是在这个范畴里的。</p>

<p>你跳出去，还打着一样名号干舆论和民族情绪上离心离德的事，即便不谈支不支持你的立场，事实上你都是在拖累其他人。</p>

<p>这也是为什么现在很多人跟轮子切割，主观直觉还是客观经验上都能知道他们是累赘。</p>

<p>所以你突出一个完全不成熟，甚至可能是政治负资产的观念希望作为集体的一部分，用长远点的视角，那就是在资敌。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>我借用您的话来回应您：“到头来反而是自己变成威权主义者”</strong></p>

<p>你跟我的其中一个重要区别是，制度演变受社会趋势影响，又受社会发展程度影响，你自己也意识到了，但是你不愿意顺从符合社会事实，大众所需的发展利益而谋求政治立场。</p>

<p>不以人为本，顺应社会潮流去出发，才会陷入有威权主义需求的结果。</p>

<p>威权本身是中性的，任何国家到现在都有威权。</p>

<p>区别是，通常语境里的威权是单方面的弹压不需要任何逻辑。</p>

<p>比如中共存在的法理基础和群众基础，其实都已经不复存在，唯一还存在的原因，是有先发优势，能对民众实施弹压的威权管制，来形成寒蝉效应，所以财政一旦玩不转他们就崩了。</p>

<p>但是如果你顺应社会主流，基于大众利益的去追求政治立场和观念，你就具备事实基础，不需要担心，而不会坠入威权化的陷阱里。</p>

<p>中共为什么担心，因为他们的政策与社会发展背道而驰，六四后更是怕被翻旧账到底，才有了经济发展合法性的逻辑。</p>

<p>民主国家的选举结果，也是威权的体现，但这种威权来自于大众认受性，形成了社会最大公约数。</p>

<p>那你办事就是名正言顺，有法理有依据。</p>

<p>这也是为什么我说你根本就没有办法避免陷入威权陷阱，而我们的路线可以。</p>

<p>因为的追求的是基于现在社会大众需求的制度改革，不是要为了拆屋子而拆。</p>

<p>你追求的完全独立论，没有社会群众基础，也就没落实空间，你想执行，人人都会跳出来反对。</p>

<p>你们没有任何现实感，不贴近现实，玩政治术语和黑话在小圈子里尚可，出来了反而自己把自己兜晕了。</p>

<p>什么是现实感，现实感就是对客观现实的承认。</p>

<p>比如是否有所谓的吴国燕国独立的群众基础，如果真的有，我没法说没有，如果没有，你不能默认有。</p>

<p>否则就变成了明明没有，你非要默认有，然后认为有可实行性，但具体方案也给不出来，进而导致基于这一点的一系列逻辑推演，对现实问题处理方案的手法，出现了大量逻辑不自洽的地方。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>1） 独立的吴国人口不到1.7亿。</strong></p>

<p><strong>2） 七十年代后，各国超发货币，制造通货膨胀，全球货币使用量虚高。</strong></p>

<p><strong>3） 自由银行 + 解除土地管制 + 全国变成面向全球的贸易自由港 = 成本戏剧化降低</strong></p>

<p>​</p>

<p>1） 连群众基础都没有，就自己划分了人口范围，里面有多少人是跟随你的，有多少人是外地不符合你国民定义的，你自己算过吗？如果完全没落实空间，那你一切推演都无法逻辑自洽，前面已经说过了。</p>

<p>江苏八千多万人口，两千多万是外来的，乱七八糟算在一起至少三千万近四千万人口具备高度流动性。</p>

<p>2） 没有对应的全球市场，连供应链都断了，拿什么作为进出口的资本，进入你货币市场的价值在哪，别说外国人不承认了，本地人更不承认。</p>

<p>你搞清楚一件事，你是突然从中国的土地上划了国境线，社会现实的问题都是被你制造出来的，没有一个逐渐发展的过程给环境自我改变。</p>

<p>光是供应链问题，第一个起来反对的就是所谓江浙沪当地的中小企业主。</p>

<p>供应链都在国内其他地方，这不是游戏没有几个人反对，你做任何事都会牵扯到现实里的人。</p>

<p>3）首先，自由银行根本不可行，认为这个可行本身就是没常识的体现。</p>

<p>单一金融企业别说十四亿，你就算是1.7亿的所谓吴国，也根本没企业可以承担。</p>

<p>其次，解除土地管制，会直接导致大量的土地兼并，而还有许多压根没有土地的人，你连土地产权的问题都无法立刻解决，怎么敢快速开放土地，市场挤兑会发生什么你清楚么？历史上类似的可借鉴例子太多了。</p>

<p>以及，你哪来的自由港资本？</p>

<p>基本的逻辑问题，江浙沪赚钱的一个根本原因，是因为背靠中国的庞大市场，有廉价劳动力，有稳定的降低成本的供应率和基建。</p>

<p>当你成立吴国的那一刻，工厂在外地的供应不复存在，本地工厂甚至没有原材料和零件，你的出口会暴跌。</p>

<p>出口暴跌意味着大量的企业减产，然后就是通缩裁员，大量的人口失业，你的进口也会下降，并且因为你没摆脱出口导向经济，出口一完蛋，就没有经济增长的核心来源。</p>

<p>没有廉价劳动力，生产成本暴增，本地人口可以拓展的产业变得非常有限，原本一些价格很低的生活消费品，会因为人口产业不足以覆盖，价格开始大幅度提高。</p>

<p>你甚至连到国外建厂的资金都没有，因为你这个时候处于关键商品过高通胀，原本流通在全国市场进出口，而本地消耗不足的产品通缩。</p>

<p>很多自由港集中转口贸易，你要么背靠一个庞大的消费市场，要么你自身高度经济发达，然后能产业转型提供特定服务，香港就是建立在背靠大陆市场和本地金融服务为增长源头。</p>

<p>失去大陆的人口优势，你的用人成本会保障，吴国所谓的1.7亿人，剔除水分能有几千万？还想维持原来的生活水平？不可能。</p>

<p>通过自然演化诞生的独立国家，其人口结构和流动方向，都会被时间逐渐沉淀下来有一个合理区域。</p>

<p>你这样突然划分，根本就没有什么逻辑可言，带来的只有混乱，这也是为什么瑞士跟你举例的完全不是一回事，瑞士是长期历史沉淀的结果，吴国是你瞬间划分出来的政治概念，民族甚至社会关系都没变。</p>

<p>李震死因现有史料有疑点无定论，以自杀论为主。</p>

<p>具体只能等党史档案公布，现有说法是与林彪或周有关。</p>

<p>周在国务院，分为两个情况，一部分是表面遵从和贯彻毛的要求，五一六进行清查，另一面依仗国务院官僚系统进行保护性对抗。</p>

<p>而五一六通知被中共相当于二次执政的政治总结 《 关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的决议 》定为文革纲领。</p>

<p>造反派之前整官僚系统，毛中期转变风向进行平衡，反过来变成行政系统整造反派，周在这个过程里扮演的角色显然不光彩，借毛泽东的政治需求找补。</p>

<p>可以理解为五一六当中行政官僚整肃造反派和波及平民范围大，周对整肃问题参与和积极性高，五一六衍生的一系列冲突扩大化后非常严重，否则不会出现中央党校教授金春明在八十年代索要档案被拒，说明不予公开。</p>

<p>如果确实与周积极肃清造反派，导致扩大化波及平民有关，老国务院派系的人不想公开的理由就很明显了，会影响周的政治声誉，明面上再次把周跟文革捆绑，意味着他们这一系的人直接从文革整肃过程里继承了党权，而实际上都知道周是文革的消极抵抗者，另一面也同时是贯彻毛政治要求的推波助澜者。</p>

<p>中共对外党史的说法，问题都在四人帮和造反派，周的形象是毛有错，文革中周艰难支撑大局，保护了很多老干部，这也并不算说错。</p>

<p>但涉及周整人，贯彻毛意志的地方，被淡化或抹除了，黑锅全部甩到造反派身上，自然官僚系统反击时的一系列情况，不过糊涂账太多没法细究，党史档案完全公开肯定有不利于国务院派系，尤其是周本人的资料。</p>

<p>等同于彻底失去否定文革带来的派系继承合法性，不过计划经济时代过去，毛左彻底完蛋，现在不提更多是维护周恩来个人对整个中共建政的作用，因为国内舆论宣传就是周恩来总理的健全形象，描绘毛朱周的和睦。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2004.30</strong> —–2023-03-18 04:15:09+08:00:</p>

<p>因为扩大化波及平民，改革开放的政治依靠就是对文革的彻底否定，不过否定的黑锅给了四人帮，把对毛神圣性的影响降到最低，周也是被动或主动的参与者，但这里直接把周摘出去了。</p>

<p>如果周、四人帮、毛都是文革参与者，否定四人帮的立场就站不住，两者不可共存，只能是周顶着四人帮压力，四人帮单方面的整顿老干部和平民，让叙事上将官僚和平民划到统一战线。</p>

<p>因为本身多数时糊涂账，归结于四人帮从方向上讲是没问题的，但对他们来说也有必要省略官僚体系肃清造反派时波及的平民问题，否则站不住脚，要谈改革开放得人心的基础，就要有文革不得人心的事实。</p>

<p><strong>欲加之罪，何患无辞？我没说过“瞬间”。四十多年了，CCP干部子女移到发达国家就一大堆，习明泽自己上完浙大，再上哈佛。CCP不是韩国威权军阀，接触现代文明后，第一，阶级条件反射，自觉形秽，第二，按照您热爱的大一统的逻辑，拒绝分权。</strong></p>

<p>威权政府本质没有区别，只是程度不同，中国能从帝制过渡到军阀暴力为依托的共和，并且后面进入工业化背景与农业思维残留的高度集权，并且还能从中走出来，让社会形态更进一步，哪怕现在再次集权，也根本没有改变社会在进步的事实。</p>

<p>改革开放才四十多年，放到历史角度来讲就是瞬间，非常短，一个人都到不了中年，还在壮年。</p>

<p>假设未来二十多年伴随经济发展，社会存在了客观的自由化需求，已经能达成和平分权，或者最低成本的自我改革。</p>

<p>无论现在还是未来，我都可以说人们追寻的是保证市场统一、法统完整下，追求最低成本的改革，并且会持续有这种需求。</p>

<p>因为中国不可能倒退回农业时代，民主化是一种工业社会发展到一定程度的必然产物。</p>

<p>而不是通过拆解一个法理完整的民族国家就可以获得的，认为这种办法可以获得，本身就是一种本末倒置，病了直接杀掉的做法，这绝不是欲加之罪何患无辞。</p>

<p>社会发展是客观可触及的，社会才是国家的主体，开倒车只会让社会的矛盾加剧最后爆发内战，人们寻求的是正常体制，而不是过激或落后体制。</p>

<p>你要是说现在有很多人都寻求独立，我没什么好反对的，但客观上就是不存在足够形成一个阶级、群体的声音。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>您的敌人是谁？我没有恨之入骨的敌人，只有讨厌的政治对手。历史教导我，同阵营可以干出烂事，对立面也可以干好事。政坛沉浮，集中权力就要当心，分散权力值得推广，只此而已。如果独立派的人独裁，就得打倒。</strong></p>

<p>你追求的是什么，我觉得应该是民主化吧。</p>

<p>不如排个序：</p>

<p>民主自由化（分权社会）、国族独立（吴国燕国）、威权独裁（对内不同意的弹压），哪个排第一位？</p>

<p>我肯定是分权社会＞国族独立＞威权独裁</p>

<p>然后这里有一个问题就在于，我有办法去很好的处理威权独裁过渡到分权社会。</p>

<p>而你认为不通过吴国燕国独立不能达成，并且交流过程里，我很大程度发现你似乎比起民主化本身，更注重独立这一事实。</p>

<p>所以我很难不去自作主张给出一个主观判断，认为是国族独立＞威权独裁＞分权社会（如果是你认为的大一统的话）</p>

<p>因此问题就来到一个分水岭。</p>

<p>我的政治观点是，社会必须达成分权，应该保持统一状态。</p>

<p>你的政治观点似乎是，社会必须达成独立，否则即便统一分权也不如没有。</p>

<p>如果你默认是追求分权社会，而不是追求独立大于分权社会，那你应该是同样反对威权独裁的阵营。</p>

<p>但客观现实是，全国绝大部人，压根不会寻求吴国燕国的诞生和存在，也没有这种思潮，甚至键政群体里都是个小圈子的话题。</p>

<p>那么假设有一天，自由化阵营跟威权化阵营对线，全国搞比例对抗，你在同样反对威权独裁的这个阵营里，至少是被第三方中立群体划分到这个范畴来的。</p>

<p>然后你提出一个与社会大众主流观点、情绪和历史观背道而驰的极端论调。</p>

<p>威权化阵营有没有可能通过利用你这个跳板，攻击自由化是要分裂中国，因此中国更需要威权化的集权</p>

<p>现实当中远不如你给出观点魔怔的普通宪政派别，就已经随时被扣上分裂中国的帽子，未来社会状况下滑，民生和放权议题有了社会基础，但不代表国族独立这种话题存在。</p>

<p>所以尽管我不反对你提这个议题，但政治上的关键分水岭时期，可想而知你还是会打着近似的政治旗帜，去分裂有限的有生力量（虽然我不觉得实际能有多少影响，但舆论负资产从香港运动就可以看出来，总是被敌对力量抓住无限放大）</p>

<p>假设你不觉得跟希望分权、允许你发声存在，但不接受和支持国族独立的自由化阵营是一条战线。</p>

<p>本质只要支持统一，无论民主化与否，都是你的政敌，你会在这个政敌身上狠狠刺一刀，区别在于，同样统一派别，威权化阵营轮不到你捅，因为压根不允许你存在和发声。</p>

<p>那么只有对你温和的，允许你发声和存在的自由化阵营会以最大善意，受到来自独立派别的最大伤害</p>

<p>这是一个基本的政治账。</p>

<p>自由化阵营你起码有存在的权力，威权化阵营没有。</p>

<p>但你可能就不会因为这个原因靠拢某一方，那么独立派别是否会成为自由化阵营的负资产，就是个显而易见的问题了。</p>

<p>如果说客观存在很多人要独立，那你们反而是要拉拢的存在，可现实里面你们根本没群众基础，出于好意允许你们的观念存在，是否会成为搬石头砸脚的事，好心办坏事坑死自己呢？</p>

<p>因为客观上就是大众都支持统一，所以自由化阵营原则上出于民生考虑，不反对独立观念的存在，但也不可能支持。</p>

<p>这也是为什么在我看来，不去基于现实群众基础谈独立与否是幼稚的原因。</p>

<p>怎么与独立派别相处，这些都是需要长远考虑的事，香港问题已经预演一次了，我不会也不想在这种问题上二进宫。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>词用对了。国族 nation 是政治虚构产品，民族 ethnicity 是人类学民族学概念。中华国族，吴越国族，皆是编出来的，而第二个比第一个在语言和民俗上更自洽，疆土管理成本更低。</strong></p>

<p>除非你有强大的军事力量，强大的组织和社会现实存在基础，否则你没有余地进行宣传，也不能改变人们的观念。</p>

<p>一地不可能打全国，你在确保拥有对抗全国的资源的同时，就需要外地的资源，这个过程里就会出现扩张，也就违背了独立的初衷。</p>

<p>而最后为了保护政权自身，就会形成一个全国性政权，北洋政府到国共内战已经完好演示了，哪怕不考虑民族统一的需求与情绪，客观现实带来的利益矛盾也会走上那步。</p>

<p>我没兴趣停留在说和幻想的环节，因为你们要么就做，要么就没有群众基础在小圈子玩自己的。</p>

<p>这个话题跟有群众基础的又不一样，你是比谁都清楚的，所以要杠必须是你确实认为有可施行的事实基础才有足够依据。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“ 农业社会的威权成分更高，但工业社会下，人就是人，没有本质区别，社会会随着构成改变而形成现代化的民主国家。”</strong></p>

<p>我非常接受这个客观规律。再说一遍，</p>

<p>如果你接受就该公开承认一点，中国社会也能伴随发展本身，形成一个民主统一的国家，而不必刻意谋求国族独立，进行额外成本，劳民伤财的一系列政治性运动。</p>

<p>因为，如果是要靠独立达成对社会的制衡，那么既然天然发展刻意得到制衡，为什么还需要独立？</p>

<p>客观规律下，也就不存在所谓的暴秦大一统思维这种超脱于一切物质，好像会从亚空间天降到每个出生人口大脑里的跨时代思维。</p>

<p>说白了，过去所看到的，只是物理与科技带来的一个社会最优化结果。</p>

<p>而产业发展，工业化社会，能打破这个结果。</p>

<p>你所在的时代，看到的是“以为无法打破，所以需要独立来治一治”</p>

<p>但实际上，我们是处于“按照正常道路走，虽然人口多进度慢，但还是会进步，不需要谋求独立这种极端伤害社会大众的办法。”</p>

<p>如果你能接受，就没有独立和统一的矛盾，我们也没必要争。</p>

<p><strong>威权是独裁的一种。您通篇说的应该是独裁。</strong></p>

<p>独裁，是威权的一种。</p>

<p>你可以把威权定义为一种在社会当中有浓度比例的存在。</p>

<p>民主化国家也有威权存在，美国的威权状况到民权运动后才慢慢被淡化，但你不能说一二战美国不是民主国家，包括日本也是，日本仍然有相当的政治威权现象，但还是一个民主国家。</p>

<p>只不过它的结构从诞生开始就是稳固的，这不妨碍社会当中有资源的人形成一个威权存在去积极施加一些影响和力量，监督更少，社会相对更黑暗，对族裔歧视和压榨也是公开的。</p>

<p>更别提法理威权了。</p>

<p>新加坡就是一个威权国家，但实行事实上的民主制度，然后依赖法理威权，和制度下上先发优势有利于自己的制度，单一政党可以获得最大话语权，但如果选民观念完全改变，他们也必须面对挑战，是利用民主制度实行威权管制的存在。</p>

<p>只不过通常语境里我们提到的威权是专门指专制独裁之类的存在。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>您还未掌权，便已学会代表人民。</strong></p>

<p>这是一个基本的现实问题，你到墙内网站也好，还是中间立场的这个SUB里都好，或者现实生活里各地走一走。</p>

<p>我都敢说，为了独立而独立，要从汉人当中分裂一个独立民族，然后成立独立民族国家的人，1%都没有，1%就人口比例都够你成立国家了。</p>

<p>这不是一个我代表不代表的事，而是一个基于现实感的社会生活常识。</p>

<p>你不能因为你这种观点自己知道根本没人支持，所以我说这种纯粹是让你想清楚的常识问题，你就说我是代表人民。</p>

<p>我只是就事论事，事实就是这样，你要是真的很多人支持独立论，我也不能说不存在，对不对？</p>

<p>没有的，我也没法说存在，所以这不是代表人民，不要搞得好像很多潜在支持者一样。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>首先，舆论是意识形态机器造出来的。</strong></p>

<p>首先，键政圈里你们都是极少数，你们要有基础才能获得组织力量，然后才能造你想造的观点，但获得组织力量的过程就无法达成，是个死循环。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>其次，民族情绪？什么族？哈萨克还是土家族？情绪怎么衡量，您哪年哪月做的民调？</strong></p>

<p>其次，代表中间立场的一些社区是否建立X族的做法为主流，如果从模糊反共立场，你可以在很多地方得到临时性的支持，但是如果从民生立场，切入到实际状况，你很难有人支持到落实这个环节，香港和台湾都是例子。</p>

<p>基本的生活接触、常识，我没在现实或墙内这些人流量最大的地方，在汉族主流当中看到有所谓你提出的要求，那么你如何从汉族的主体人口和土地上建立一个敌对性的民族和政权？</p>

<p>这就是为什么我吐槽你们，因此每次到这个地方，不是我没有现实感，而是你们没有，并且你们很大程度不是完全没有，而是也意识到了自己走的是死胡同，但沉没成本太高不愿意掉头，变成了为独立而独立，钻牛角尖。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>再次，离心离德…… 咱俩谁更唯心？</strong></p>

<p>我不愿意时常把话题归结于你个人，是因为我觉得浪费时间，你观点被驳斥了就没存在价值了，也实际已经完成的。</p>

<p>但你一定要说个人身上的情况，我认为就是你更唯心。（你一定要问，我是不会因为怕驳了你面子，惹怒你，就不去说我认为的实话的。）</p>

<p>但凡有一定生活常识，不可能不知道中国压根不存在你提出的，从汉族里分裂一个民族来，你可以做，但你从何入手？你也不谈。</p>

<p>你不谈，其实就是一种对实际情况的回避。</p>

<p>诸夏理论不是没有在墙内存在和流行过，但为什么到最后都高度提纯了，只保留部分黑话（因为有趣和逃避审核）</p>

<p>就是因为没有受众市场，作为过滤器把一批跟不上主流，离地没现实感的人网进去，就跟轮子对我说过，你怎么知道中国境内法轮功受众很少。</p>

<p>就….老实说，我真不知道怎么吐槽这种话。</p>

<p>我有时候说出来，不给人面子，不好，因为我觉得就事论事而已。</p>

<p>但是如果我不说，对方又时常没这个自觉，非要我说出来，然后我还拉仇恨，好像我做的很不对一样，可是让我怎么办才好。</p>

<p>这种问题就是要靠自觉，而不是一个常识问题还在拉扯，比如什么现实中国是不是有极其大量的法轮功信徒之类的说法。</p>

<p>你在国内生活成长并且了解国内社会，对吧？</p>

<p>基于这个前提我才跟别人交流，大家无论是抬杠还是争论，都起码要有一个共识的基础。</p>

<p>在我看来上面都是纯粹废话，根本不应该由我说出来，而是一个有中国生活常识，简中互联网深入了解的键政人士的基本素养。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>最后，您没有诠释现实的垄断权。</strong></p>

<p>习近平在执政，这就是客观事实，有人说习近平权力不稳，是傀儡，我说这是纯粹扯淡，别人说我这叫做对诠释现实的垄断权，大体就是这样。</p>

<p>或者，黑猪是黑的，白猪是白的，黑猪凭什么是黑的，白猪凭什么是白的。</p>

<p>人们都是主观看待世界的，但是客观轮廓的形成，则是多数主观的描述重合，形成的一种普遍认知，而独立于人的认知之外的客观，怎么去探求这个结果，我觉得完全是有迹可循，而非无处可寻。</p>

<p>前面说很多了，不赘述。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>两千年来，帝国主义需求有，小国寡民需求也有，所以天下大势，分久必合，合久必分。然后，您不是从自发秩序的角度看待问题，而且您心里清楚。帝国领土，您自己承认过，是靠暴力，不是自愿，粘合起来的。既然是暴力，那么跟马列式历史趋势，先进生产力，毫无关系。正相反，多国多元体系所能保存的科技知识，比祖传文化遗产动不动失传的历代帝国更代表先进生产力。</strong></p>

<p>你没搞清楚的一件事，那就是古代的暴力糅合，跟后来近代民族国家的确立，法理上的健全，是完全两回事。</p>

<p>古代杀再多人，你的法理也追溯不到那去。</p>

<p>两者并不是并列存在。</p>

<p>也即，不存在所谓现代中国是帝国主义靠暴力糅合所谓多民族（燕人吴人等）的产物。</p>

<p>因此你无法从中创造任何民族，因为人的主观认知情绪就是都是汉族、是中国人。</p>

<p>奥斯曼或罗马，都是从统治开始，就建立在多民族基础上，并且这些民族有相当占比、影响与居住地，也从来没有被融合到一起。</p>

<p>类似类比，就是奥斯曼和罗马，不但存续到现代，还在十到十八世纪逐渐完成了民族国家的社会基础，民族高度被融合，十九世纪则转型为一个完整的民族国家。</p>

<p>奥斯曼和罗马人就不再是一个政治身份（如罗马早期也是文化和地理身份）。</p>

<p>就跟为什么日本人、美国人，那些世界上同样庞大有多元基础的国家，不会继续裂解？所以如果区别中国本身去看待，那么也无法解释为什么日本一样是各地自治多元化，但还是走上了军国主义，德国和意大利同理。</p>

<p>所以能看出来，社会的工业化与经济发达程度，才是遏制的最好基石。</p>

<p>欧洲并不缺乏多元制衡，但仍然长期处于威权时代，所以你的多元体系观念在现代是无法成立的。</p>

<p>撕裂中国市场，与工业化背道而驰，只会造成各地独立的威权专制政府如与雨后春笋一般诞生。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>野心家擅长将个人教条打扮成所谓玄乎其玄的集体利益，言必称“大众”，“国民”。</strong></p>

<p>那么寻求多元独立，本身也是与之相同的产物。</p>

<p>而即便大众都接受两者全是所谓“野心家”的观点。</p>

<p>你觉得大众在现有基础下，会接受莫名其妙自己变成其他民族，说的话不是汉语，国家被撕裂，经济严重受重创，资产价格暴跌吗？</p>

<p>所以一切都是民生问题，哪怕你认为是野心家的选择。</p>

<p>但是区别在于，其中一方允许全国人用脚投票，而坚持独立者却反对外地人在本地有票权，还不能解释为什么本地的外来流入人口突然变外国人，法律上无法解释。</p>

<p><strong>“那算不算拖后腿的队友。”</strong></p>

<p><strong>我希望独立诸国宪政民主，但众反CCP者算同路人，互帮互助为佳。</strong></p>

<p>事实上就香港而言，类似事情已经发生过背刺问题，我上面已经说了。</p>

<p>在我看来持此观点者，最终目的是独立与反对大一统，宪政民主和反独裁是实现这两者的工具，而不是目的。</p>

<p>因为达到宪政的温和办法客观存在，却不被接受，而被划线到“邪恶”的大一统阵营，所以其背后动机逻辑，是可以在这种情况凸显出来的。</p>

<p>要是拆屋效应，为什么可以开窗户了还坚持拆屋，这件事本身就无法逻辑自洽，尤其是引入引发社会进步的变量后。</p>

<p><strong>手里有权，面目乃现；原句奉还，与君共勉。</strong></p>

<p>什么是权力的构成，我觉得你始终没搞清楚这一点，这也是为什么我说这类政治和对社会形态的观念十分的原始，本质就是没脱离威权主义者的架构。</p>

<p>权力不是你给一个命令人家就去做，任何人来到世上都是孤独的，除了自己肉体外无法命令他人。</p>

<p>权力的体现是一个命令的合理性，这个合理性要有许多构成。</p>

<p>你在一个威权主义社会，权力可以靠自我思考不多的个体，用等级制度来执行。</p>

<p>你在一个高度发达的工业化社会，威权主义慢慢褪色，你的每一个命令都必须符合你在这个集体里的位置，而集体的诞生也必须基于共识。</p>

<p>要是你违背这个共识，你的基础就会不稳固，日本军国主义就展示了下克上的状况，上层想踩刹车与下层违背，就出现了刺杀事件。</p>

<p>川普想表现出威权化的一面，但没人鸟他。</p>

<p>必须让人相信一个命令是来自于内心认可合理的，符合其价值观的，否则根本不可能执行下去。</p>

<p>就跟我要在现代搞帝制，称帝然后封国一样，可能吗？有人鸟我吗？八成当我弱智。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“你根本就没有办法避免陷入威权陷阱，而我们的路线可以“</strong></p>

<p>不可以。无人不渴望独裁，区别在于程度。最终达到何种地步，部分取决于强有力竞争者的数量和意志。客观上，您的存在制约我，我的存在牵制您，彼此不情愿地提高自身水平在军政界激烈竞争，才能避免个人落入独裁陷阱。自由化时代背景下，工业化的土耳其匈牙利和波兰近年由新自由主义法西斯控制，已为您敲响警钟，虽然我认为您其实不在乎。原因：您党同伐异的过激反应，对符合您个人政治路线的独裁家，事物，的宽容态度，证明了您的专政倾向。</p>

<p>1）大一统的孙中山</p>

<p>制约来自于权力的来源，而不是制造障碍，障碍最终会形成矛盾，但障碍不解决谁能赢，反而提供了一个“赢者通吃”的可能。</p>

<p>魏玛共和国同样存在大量的选民和自由主义者，该机制最终还是让纳粹有可趁之机，然后纳粹借这个跳板发动政变来最终夺取权力。</p>

<p>你不可能在一个社会还没完全过渡到自由化的时期，就指望这种完全不切实际的结构能解决问题，尤其是脱离国族体系，已经完全不是为了分权制衡存在的时候。</p>

<p>而且土耳其、匈牙利、波兰，都压根没有达到所谓足够高程度的工业化。</p>

<p>他们的国家都有制衡的障碍存在，但有没有解决社会环境带来的威权主义者存在？</p>

<p>没有。</p>

<p>这恰巧证明我说的对。</p>

<p>所以制衡论已经破产，制衡是相对概念，权力构成和来源才是关键，威权主义者可以随时靠数量和掀桌子打破制衡，除非他们自身的合法性来自于可以被结构的设计。</p>

<p>他们不能违背支持自己的基本盘，构建一个认可现代法理的基本盘才是要紧的事。</p>

<p>这样一旦利益冲突，基本盘就会转而支持他人，或者被取而代之。</p>

<p>如果靠制衡，就会进入土耳其靠凯末尔改革运动的军方等形式不断介入政治，或者泰国一样军方干政的反复矛盾。</p>

<p>没有普遍社会基础，在威权主义者尚存的环境下，只有被干倒和干倒对方的情况，制衡参与者，总有强弱和不同时期的变化，不可能恒定一个强度，所以分权、权力结构才是制衡根本，而不是树立两个木桩希望平安无事。</p>

<p>还有强反例就是沙特与伊朗，被外界经济影响，不得不进行一定程度的世俗化改革。</p>

<p>你可以说我是专政的，但你不能解决问题，判断路线错误，带来一系列混乱时，社会将自然站在你的对立面。</p>

<p>实用主义角度并不会因为你要拆屋子，所以开窗户的人就是错的，因此乱叫专政，若与事实推演和发展不符，只是在告诉别人拿专政大棒乱敲。</p>

<p>历史上要制衡的国家要多数有多少，没有人是脱离了工业化背景就进行宪政民主的。</p>

<p>因此主轴可以确定的情况下，社会背景调查你没搞清楚，就是添乱。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>您不赞同专政？引进列宁党制度，以党训政，倡导党国一体，这是民主主义者所为？”如离开我而讲共和、讲民主，则是南辕而北其辙“ 这是自由主义吗？</strong></p>

<p>​</p>

<p>清朝是在空中解体瞬间进入了民国状态。</p>

<p>仍然是一个威权主义社会，没有人能跳脱这个背景。</p>

<p>如果孙中山不用威权主义去执行共和，难道用同样是威权主义但更落后帝制？军阀管理制度来幻想问题可以得到解决吗？</p>

<p>这也是为什么制度有其先进性，当农业社会转型发展时，就会必然诞生出一个近似的政党。</p>

<p>就跟你在春秋战国幻想其他国家不推行郡县制一样，实际上各国从一开始就都在试图统一，只是做不到而已。</p>

<p>北洋时期更是如此，没有人能做大而已，袁世凯最大时，想称帝被人反对罢了。</p>

<p>国民党的先进性在此时就体现出来。</p>

<p>四亿人口的威权社会，没有工业化输入，最后内卷的产物就是中共。</p>

<p>但是了七十年代末也维持不住，被迫改革开放，因此冒出来自由化思潮。</p>

<p>那么，社会的威权成分是恒定不会变的吗？不是。</p>

<p>既然会变，为什么要在未来威权更低的时候，采取对所有人伤害最大的方法（即便这种方法没有任何实行的群众基础和渠道）</p>

<p>否定社会在进步，中国的社会成分比例随着更进一步的工业化，十四亿人口的广大需求，必然会衍生出一系列来自于威权自由化互相斗争的历史事件，否定自由化本身可以获胜来让社会良性运作，出于何种逻辑。</p>

<p>一个社会，一个时代会有一定进步，如不是恒定不变，即否定独立拆屋的说法可成立。</p>

<p>孙中山所执行的，就是符合当时中国社会真实构成的产物，是威权主义下的共和制，既非蒋介石时期的做法，也不是共产党后来的路线。</p>

<p>相反，后来国共两党实际都一定程度偏离孙中山的路线，没有完全落实。</p>

<p>我反对的是在大清搞民主，在民国谈帝制，这些不合时宜的制度，不符合社会的生产力与发展背景，同样在民国要求一步到位，只是缺乏现实感的幻想而已。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>您推荐顺应潮流？钱玄同1925年评价孙中山：“孙先生确乎还是‘国民之敌【…】国民愿意苟安旦夕，喜欢维持现状；孙先生偏要提倡奋斗，主张革命。【…】一句话，国民要静坐或倒退，而孙先生要抖擞精神地跑。“</strong></p>

<p>钱玄同是章太炎路线的人，孙中山早期也并不执着统一，国内也的确存在宋教仁建立一个从上而下法理的可能性，前提是宋教仁没死，可以凝聚国内许多派系力量。</p>

<p>指望袁世凯，有可能吗？你会指望习近平吗？</p>

<p>孙中山为什么PTSD后来坚持政党要有力量和组织，就是因为宋教仁死后，各地军阀发作，拿他们当名头和炮灰。</p>

<p>章太炎在这个时期跟孙中山产生分歧，二次护法说白了就是章太炎被打出PTSD，但却认为搞孙中山路线没出路，反而寄托旧军阀有可取之处，</p>

<p>为什么章太炎搞联省自治，就是因为在他的逻辑下，认为没可能靠一个强而有力的政权打败所有军阀，所以退而求其次选择这条路线。</p>

<p>而且章太炎不傻，他知道自己被军阀当夜壶，也没能力平衡让军阀之间遵从某些逻辑。</p>

<p>当时社会就是谁拳头大谁说话时，兵强马壮者为天子，因为清朝没有留下完整改革，突然解体，让落后的北洋军阀和革命党都准备不足。</p>

<p>这就像，如果中共烂透了，还有一定程度拥护中共威权执政的人的学生，来锐评更先进符合时代状况寻求民主化的政权。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“孙中山的训政思路【…】最后宪政达成省份自治”</strong></p>

<p><strong>1922年8月12日，孙中山指出：“中国此时最可虑者，乃在各省借名自治，实行割据，以启分崩之兆耳“。</strong></p>

<p><strong>根据他割据广州毁掉当地自发秩序，接受苏联钱财分裂民国，执意北伐中原各自治体的行动来看，在孙中山眼里，不听他命令的自治跟分裂没有区别。这就使我给您对于地方自治的支持打一个大问号。</strong></p>

<p>孙中山的训政和宪政时期，就是基于完整法统下，要对地方分权。</p>

<p>而联省自治背后，本就是各国列强扶持代理人而已，东北有日本人，英法在华南华北，德国也有参与。</p>

<p>那么，区别在哪？没区别啊你要硬说孙中山是苏联代理人，那无论毛泽东还是蒋介石，最后实际都并不是苏联的傀儡。</p>

<p>尤其是蒋介石，后来干脆清党，中共内部苏联派也被排挤出去。</p>

<p>你不可能忽略或者否定中国境内客观存在的左翼势力。</p>

<p>广东就是孙中山的基本盘，陈炯明也是他的人，两个人有主张冲突，为什么？一个主张快，一个主张慢慢来。</p>

<p>袁世凯称帝、宋教仁被杀，护法运动过后，再加上军阀大战。</p>

<p>已经确定了当时民国的底层存在逻辑，就是兵强马壮者为王。</p>

<p>旧军阀统一全国会实行宪政民主？他们连改革自己都做不到，互相攻伐，不用孙中山来敲门都打的一锅粥。</p>

<p>既然军阀和孙中山，都声称自己是中国合法政府，那么谁决定到底有权力做最后的决定。</p>

<p>孙中山不是一开始就坚持北伐的，军阀混战和袁世凯、宋教仁遇刺，都反应了当时政治环境险恶。</p>

<p>不是你想坐下来谈全国联省自治组建一个集体政府就能做到的。</p>

<p>有冯玉祥这种人存在你还想好好谈话，民国虽然下限比历朝历代都高了，但那是乱世，就像你没法要求曹操刘备袁绍孙权吕布袁术，坐下来好好谈谈如何重建一个统一政权一样。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>”从结果来看，孙中山的主张是正确的“</strong></p>

<p>您主观认为事情结果是好的就行。假设结果是好的（不是），能正当化孙中山之作为？目的达到了，手段不重要？</p>

<p>手段有什么问题？</p>

<p>军阀混战，军政府打来打去，有没有出现你说的各地之间和平共处？</p>

<p>历史上证明了不存在。</p>

<p>孙中山的路线政治上有什么问题？</p>

<p>建立一个政党，组织政府有效管理地方，新式政府、军队和作风。</p>

<p>从南往北，北伐形成国民政府，最终达成统一。</p>

<p>既然各地都默认武力是唯一沟通工具，那国民政府打赢了，做的最后也的确比军阀更好，手段就是军阀之间最基本的交流工具-武力。</p>

<p>要是能靠嘴皮谈判，说服本身就混战的军阀，何须跑到广东二次革命。</p>

<p>你该问问，袁世凯为什么要称帝，宋教仁死了怎么办，军阀都不服从法律和制度，搞出府院之争，外面有日本人虎视眈眈，现在该怎么做才能对陷入内战的全国民众有利。</p>

<p>是放任不管，等几十年，然后分裂状态下各自为战，被日本人征服更好。</p>

<p>还是快速组建一个行之有效的政权，结束内战，发展积攒力量，来应对日本人的最终必然发生的入侵更好。</p>

<p>不扫清军阀，我们现在要么说日文，你在用日语反对日本人的大一统，要么就是作为日本的劳动力转嫁成本，把中日变成一个超大号的城乡二元体系，跟国内现在靠户籍剥削农民一样，学战时纳粹德国掠夺我国劳动力。</p>

<p>你觉得威权社会主义，军阀混战，朝不保夕的年代，一个政权的建立完全来自于妥协？</p>

<p>所有从当时发展起来的政权，都是靠斗争占到最后一步。</p>

<p>正如我说的一样，我们每个人来到世上，都是孤独的，除了自己的肉体谁也控制不了。</p>

<p>救亡图存，要么左要么右，清党难道就是对的吗？</p>

<p>极权导致的体制问题，是社会的悲剧，如果说在这种庞大浪潮里，必须要求每个人都完全脱离于它，本身就是按自己的要求去诠释时代。</p>

<p>中共存在对共和国还是未来都不荒唐，我前面说过了，李承晚等历代军阀存在，有碍于大韩民国吗？</p>

<p>荣毅仁、宋庆龄、霍英东，本身要么就是同情左翼，或者有家国情怀的人，但他们并不是中共政治组织的核心部分。</p>

<p>也即是证明了，这个国家的运作，始终是政党垄断执政权，而不是没有框架的问题。</p>

<p>所以你从一开始试图否定共和国法理就站不住脚。</p>

<p>现代两个中国都是分裂于孙中山一系，并且这些政权的政府实质性运作于各个层级。</p>

<p>只不过割裂出统治与被统治阶级，公务员和政府架构存在，没有被实质性消灭，共和国也只是换了一个执政党派，最多换国名，变成第二共和国，仅此而已。</p>

<p>全世界任何一个有君主专制到立宪，军政府专制到民主化的政权，南非和美国如何解释种族隔离时代的，奴隶制社会如何解释取消奴隶制后的？</p>

<p>所以叙事从来不是问题，你只是想否定法理，给自己不从历史里太多近似情况找由头而已，跳脱现实里的方案否定才是荒唐的，尤其是假设好像没有其他情况出现时。</p>

<p>就原地硬变，只要国务院和人大这些机构客观存在，就只剩下实权化与否。</p>

<p>因为第二共和国，必然伴随大规模动荡，重新建立起政权，也依然是来自于中共的第一共和国，甚至快速过渡，连第二共和国都没有，也是完全可能的，隔壁台湾又不是没例子。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>集权换取效率，是独裁者的经典台词。农业社会，独裁是常态，不假。但农耕社会独裁家之间硬要比较也有差异：杀人少比动辄屠城好；发展经济比漠视疾苦好；止戈缓和比穷兵黩武好。</strong></p>

<p>那么，到底是袁世凯称帝，孙中山才二次革命然后开始走上武装路线，还是孙中山是天生战狂，带头挑起中国内战。</p>

<p>军阀内战都打成一锅粥，你乱说时能不能不要提止戈缓和？</p>

<p>让军阀停止内战的是谁？打赢那个。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>在政坛，天下乌鸦不一般黑，五十步也是可以笑百步的。孙中山和同时期军阀都专政，只有他连续收受取消私产的苏联钱，容纳CCP，改组国民党，毁掉广州自治。相对来说，他就是该批判。集权，在任何时代，都是危险的，千万别把黑锅都扣在生产力上。</strong></p>

<p>第一，没毁掉广州自治，陈炯明就是他的人，纲要三部曲的核心思想不是新鲜事物。</p>

<p>第二，军阀普遍都在收受代理资源或者寻求资源，区别多数在于有人能找到，有人找不到。</p>

<p>第三，军阀内部自己混战，不闻不问？孙中山建立国民党，最后北伐结束内战，难道也不闻不问吗？</p>

<p>说白了就是因为反对大一统，孙中山完成了，炮就打到孙中山头顶，张作霖要是完成了，就要骂张作霖了。</p>

<p>但归根结底这些军阀哪个都是要打仗，还没能力结束乱局。</p>

<p>你说收外部势力的钱没问题，那孙中山能快速利用外部资源，还能确保政党独立性，又可以结束内战，那就是最优解。</p>

<p>并且孙中山训政是确实想推行地方分权，联合左右，而不是排斥左翼，现在台湾就是行宪时期，孙中山意志的最终体现。</p>

<p>问题出在哪，不是出在孙中山的制度设计，而是外来力量阻止发展，没有社会改革基础，给蒋介石有长期执政的空间。</p>

<p>我完全从实用主义出发，明确指出了你既无经济、社会与行政上的可行性，还会给社会带来巨大的伤害，只是一厢情愿的政治幻想。</p>

<p>如果你没有社会与人民基础，要强推一个路线，比如共产党在中国，结果是灾难性的。</p>

<p>这些非常贴地的判断分析摆在面前，坚持一意孤行，在没有任何社会基础和群众基础的前提下，如果要自嗨，我不管你，我反对的从来不是情绪上的反对独立，而是没有任何方案，却要跟我这样认真讨论方案的人做没有内容的假设。</p>

<p>单纯从你对人口政策的语焉不详，我们已经可以公开向所有在看的人证明一点。</p>

<p>你根本没有实际可用的具体执行策略，一切都只停留在假大空层面。</p>

<p>至于民众的生活质量，本就不是你优先考虑的东西。</p>

<p>明明有影响，让你拿具体方案，出来行不通，还是说没影响。</p>

<p>真正要到你负责的地方，你就当甩手掌柜了，这就是为什么我有时候瞧不上这种论调，不粘锅。</p>

<p>包括你上面回复我，非要说我代表人民，我寻思这不是基本键政的现实认知观？国内是独立者多？证明呢？</p>

<p>还停留在幻想阶段，毫无可实行性的东西，没有一点是真正能落地的，所有人就好像NPC一样会接受你的做法。</p>

<p>独立，是不是一种社会客观有需求声音的东西？</p>

<p>但具体怎么做，没有任何一点是能说得清的。</p>

<p>你是有广大人民群众，还是有组织支持能最终武力建国，如果没有，那你是不是会去做？不去做，就始终是大脑主观脱离客观的单方面构思而已。</p>

<p>而且，你要搞清楚，是在为政治观点抬杠，还是辩论。</p>

<p>我也不美曰其名，我感觉你这面就是在抬杠，没有主动留出求同存异的余地，这是你跟我的区别，我不反对合理的独立，所以实际上我比你更温和。</p>

<p>因为民主化的根本目的是为了国民的生活质量、幸福与长远利益，按户籍制分人口，就是承认中共法理，又跟你否定的自相矛盾。</p>

<p>你拿到公共场合，非要让我给你掰扯，就必须有实践可行性，否则就是个人主观的构思，不代表有实际可行性。（似乎你现在还没跟我明确，这到底是有广泛可实践的真实政治路线，还是只是平时自己希望看到的观点，我也没法说我想民主化，就真的立刻有民主化这么扯淡，我必须考虑现实方案。）</p>

<p>想让人接受和服从你的观点、方案，要么拿出合理方案来获得群众支持，要么你拳头大你说话算，现在看，前者是肯定没有的，在地人口投票这件事你都过不去。</p>

<p><strong>“中共存在的法理基础和群众基础，其实都已经不复存在”</strong></p>

<p><strong>CCP以前，现在，将来，从未有过法理。否则，他们就不会对中华民国（台湾）虎视眈眈了。</strong></p>

<p>八十年代学生追求自由化，目的也不是政党更替为主，意识形态本身就有其支持者。</p>

<p>现在的政党法理来自于经济增长，政权法理来自于共和国自身的体制架构。</p>

<p>一旦脱离过高，就会出现更多问责，最终形成政党或国名更替。</p>

<p>而国务院和人大，各级政府不会凭空消失，他们是一个完整体系，有没有中共存在，他们都是一个事实政府，区别只是最后政权的名字叫什么而已。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>他们对自身卑微地位，比外人要敏感，把解决合法性缺失的方案错误地寄托在打完内战上了。</strong></p>

<p>中共首先在内战时就有大量的中左人士立场上支持。</p>

<p><strong>而群众基础，大跃进结束后就消失殆尽了。跟列宁一样，您口中所谓社会发展规律是为您的价值观服务的。</strong></p>

<p><strong>中国一切腾飞的条件五十年代就具备了，否则毛泽东在窑洞里也不会有资本和底气骗代表团说未来CCP夺权后会开放外资直接投资建厂，承接西方业务。</strong></p>

<p><strong>苏联资助邻国起源于清末革命党的两支团队，嫡系团队则利用了落后环境内部分落后分子，打败另一支队伍。</strong></p>

<p>其次群众基础到放弃意识形态后才彻底破产，城市和农场是两回事，农场对意识形态的判定都没有，这就是没发展带来的保守问题。</p>

<p>所以发展才是进步根本，中共政治宣传，并不能解释为什么还是很多人在文革后信任中共，因为确实存在理想主义，只不过国人自行把中共区分开来。</p>

<p>而中共也的确是一个整体，让其有可分割空间，并且改革开放的政策路线正确，平反后的经济政治正常化，老一辈理想主义者还在，耳目渲染维持了一定时间的意识形态合法性。</p>

<p>直到六四后，彻底破产，并且经济合法性也渐渐不牢靠，习近平走上集权对付的道路。</p>

<p><strong>活活阻碍了中国本应前进的势头。这就是物质影响意识，落后的意识反作用于已然转变，非机械静止的环境。</strong></p>

<p>我说了很多次，人是观察历史窗口的基本单位，你要看，就看仔细些，结果是没理解我说的历史趋势。</p>

<p>几十年到一个世纪，对历史来说非常短，一眨眼而已。</p>

<p>中共前三十年妨碍了经济的发展，但是为什么最后必须回到改革开放上？</p>

<p>中国现代的经济发展、社会形态转变，实际基本上只来自于1978年后改革开放出现的一系列变化。</p>

<p>这就是一种趋势，是不可逆的，因为庞大人口必然需要合理的生存资源，一旦生活水平进步，就必然形成推进的趋势。</p>

<p>你观察似乎觉得过了很久，但是实际上只是摇摆了三十年。</p>

<p>习近平现在能靠个人意志，让中国回到计划经济吗？不可能了。</p>

<p>毛泽东是压根没发展，直接走了计划经济路线，浪费的是发展时间，相对应的是外部客观环境，以及一个人有限的一生，而不是对整个历史趋势有阻碍。</p>

<p>几十年的摆动，一眨眼罢了，前面有说过。</p>

<p>有环境不代表必然有发展，内部的思潮整理，路线选择都很重要。</p>

<p>你选择错了，万劫不复，苏联就是最好例子。</p>

<p>因为外部市场是有限的，而等待工作机会发展的国家更多。</p>

<p>中国晚几年，都可能落后于人，被印度、越南分走不少机会，虽然越早越好就是了。</p>

<p>人的选择在历史里，对趋势的影响很有限，你感觉很长，如前所述，是因为你作为一个人感觉很长。</p>

<p>这就是为什么更不能让错误的思潮，破坏中国现有的市场一体性。</p>

<p>可以给你走独立路线（不考虑任何现实因素）</p>

<p>但万一你是错的呢？我们要付出多少年才能回归正轨。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“军队并不具备独立政变去阻碍政党内部事务的空间”</strong></p>

<p><strong>不是政变。现代社会已经全球化了，科技、贸易航运发达等等因素使得三国式剧情很难重复。不过，一个政权若想站稳脚跟，取信于民，须得广大尉官和军士长鼎力支持。光靠您党同伐异，口诛笔伐，挥舞伟大计划，政治对手不怕，厌恶风险明哲保身的普通人更不搭理。</strong></p>

<p>取信于民，但却要得到军队的鼎力支持，你用后脚跟想一下，他们会支持独立还是统一方案，这些人生活与成长在分裂的环境还是统一的国家里？</p>

<p>再有，你起码应该去了解政府工作的基本逻辑。</p>

<p>你从来没说过为什么要获得这些人支持，军队的工资是谁发的，军队的补给、维护和民用设备谁提供维持的？</p>

<p>执行层面，士兵知道他们服从的是政府，军官也知道，后勤补给的人也清楚。</p>

<p>你连电力都是从政府控制的电网里获取的。</p>

<p>一切资金物资名册，都是靠政府的系统维持运转。</p>

<p>军队本身并不产生税收，也没有渠道征收税收，三个月发不出薪酬，联络不到家人，没有网络你看看还能不能维持运转。</p>

<p>基本的政治口号，对士兵、军官和普通劳动者而言哪个更有吸引力？</p>

<p>A.取消户籍制、维持原来的统一市场、资金仍然由原地政府发放</p>

<p>B.取消国民身份，取消统一市场、资金不确定。</p>

<p>军队里会有多少人因为家人和自己一夜之间变外国人而放弃你。</p>

<p>即便不考虑现实利益，到底是一个支持统一市场的政府能得到更多的企业支持，创造更多就业岗位。</p>

<p>还是一个不支持统一市场的政府能有更多企业支持，创造更多就业岗位？</p>

<p><strong>独立，不是闭关锁国。国门大开，废除海关，供应照旧。</strong></p>

<p>那其他地区不同意，企业主不同意、工人不同意，本来没有阻碍的，你突然建立起阻碍。（为什么本地和外地都要服从这种秩序，我很费解）</p>

<p>就算你再国门大开，也是外国，不是本国，欧盟内部还有经济纠纷呢，不可能不存在阻碍。</p>

<p>我很难理解你这种默认国与国之间毫无差异的做法，就瞬间建国了是出于什么逻辑。</p>

<p>你要有一个过程，对不对？从哪个环节开始的。</p>

<p>尤其是任何产业跨省，国与国一个关税协议往往扯皮不知道多少年才最终敲定全部细节的情况下，就默认了一个突然独立的地区，其他地区必然接受你的要求。</p>

<p>如果你无条件接受，不就是拿本地人当凯子么。</p>

<p><strong>莫信口雌黄，请引述！我始终强调别崇拜这三人。批判缺点，学习优点，够了。政界和社会其它层面运行，没道德是不行的。再好的体系，不靠人的素养去维持，也不灵。</strong></p>

<p>你的做法是通过先树立观点，然后来寻找一些符合自己立场的切入点，从而去试图在话题里解构，但却忽略了时代性本身，更别提细节有时候都错了。</p>

<p>强制要分裂出优缺点，然后立靶子打，给自己找个理由去说服自己中共没好人，这不是什么批判优缺点，而是先有观点后续为了维护观点去给”理由“。</p>

<p>而我们知道，时代有自己的落后性，这是一种趋势，</p>

<p>如果问题来自于制度，那你最初的苛责出发点就站不住脚，因为所有人包括你我都知道制度本身的建设很重要，能在负面制度里做出正面行为，才是难能可贵，但你提到的却不是崇拜与否，实际上你都不了解他们，反而一开始就是以”中共没好人“的逻辑，有更深层目的才拓展的话题。</p>

<p>正因为你一开始批判的不是来自于制度下的时代趋势，用现代道德规则去要求当时，并且你明知道这种区别根本树不起合理靶子的前提下还要硬说，才显得前后矛盾。</p>

<p>辛德勒也是个纳粹，一句话已经结束你一开始的表达，建议不要切换立场。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>莫信口雌黄，请引述我原句。</strong></p>

<p>“ 这些国家的单一存在法理是不具备的 ” <strong>先秦春秋战国</strong></p>

<p>“而全国统一的法理也来自于先秦。” <strong>侵略全国各地的法理依据是秦始皇，促使各地独立的法理依据只能是春秋战国，半斤八两。</strong></p>

<p><strong>现代省级行政区继承帝国主义郡县制精髓，旨在分割原本的政治实体。独立反对的就是这种武断恶劣的土地划分方式.</strong></p>

<p><strong>号称尊重法理，但我指出您所引用僭主暴秦和由胜利者书写的大一统史观毫无法理可言，您却默不吭声。共和国跟CCP高度绑定，不存在后者下台同时保存前者的可能性，否则国史由谁写，您？怎么写？</strong></p>

<p><strong>您到底尊不尊重法理？暴秦彻底瓦解封建礼法，法理何在？对于符合您帝国主义倾向，为您大一统观点辩护的国家，法理居然成了次要议题。</strong></p>

<p>你连自己说过什么都记不住么？</p>

<p>一面责怪郡县制是暴秦的帝国主义产物，另一面又说独立法理依据只能是春秋战国。</p>

<p>却又不知道春秋战国都在尝试与秦朝一样的郡县和社会制度改革，只不过秦朝是其中的赢家而已。</p>

<p>那么春秋战国在内，做的事都一模一样，按你的逻辑来说，就不是秦国本身的问题，而是当时的地理环境必然催生出这种结构，那又何来统一是人为设计的产物？</p>

<p>毕竟，谁都知道春秋战国有能力的都想集权统一，只不过赢家只能有一个而已。</p>

<p>你连前后说过什么都能随时忘记，本质就是压根没有真正观点，一切只为了立场服务，这不是抬杠是什么？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“ 评价一个人的好坏，挨个问责是否作为中共党员有没有在体制内脱离去反对体制吗？ ”</strong></p>

<p><strong>您跟“好坏”较上劲了吗？主题是不歌颂凡人。</strong></p>

<p>你执意要问责去服务于自身立场，所以不是我跟好坏较上劲，而是对你这种逻辑和目有态度。</p>

<p>是人都知道有灰色地带，需要制度建成，但这与人做的好并不矛盾，你为了解构和反对这种叙事，刻意去强调你也清楚不适用于个人的制度性问题，来作为批判的切入点。</p>

<p>这到底是什么动机？推崇制度解决问题，跟不歌颂凡人是不矛盾的，为了推行制度建设，而刻意在自己也知道合理的时代背景下挑刺，这种行为没人会认为公平。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>那又怎样？最后还是开枪了！枪杆子出政权，您的政权什么德行，得看基层官兵（基本盘）的道德底线。所以基层官兵的支持很重要，他们的道德水平更重要。</strong></p>

<p>这一点就是为什么你压根搞不懂事情是怎么运作的原因，因为你没明白这些东西的逻辑何在。</p>

<p>现代社会，一个政权的基本盘来自于他的税收和资源提供者，而不是基层官兵的道德底线，因为现代军队高度职业化，需要非常大量的资源才能维持体系运作，这也是为什么军政府时常难以维持下去。</p>

<p>军队是一个封闭执行命令的环境，个人道德水平的影响有限。</p>

<p>因为比起一个人的道德因素，首先服从集体，以及遵从个人的利益（工资）才是最常见的。</p>

<p>一个政权的基本盘，来自于为其提供资源的群众的意识形态和道德标准，而不是来自于军队基层士兵的个人道德水平。</p>

<p>任何人都需要收入，包括政权也不例外，不能提供合理法理和靠拢大众的价值观，就不可能有税收和资源基础。</p>

<p>更别提军队建设过程中，本身就是要通过提供收入和意识形态上的靠拢，来吸引人力。</p>

<p>好比你现在说要独立，没人支持你，不但没士兵，就算有人，也没有给你提供税收和资源的市民阶级。</p>

<p>就算你能通过一些外部资助获得一时间的军队优势，却也不能阻碍人们的反对浪潮。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>李承晚 不等于 润之。威权主义，不等于极权主义。前者认可法理和私产，后者否定法理和私产。还有，李承晚一介书生什么时候成军阀了？</strong></p>

<p>李承晚这样从独立运动出身，到韩国民主化之前的历任军队出身的独裁者，都是威权主义者，这就是时代客观背景下的产物。</p>

<p>极权与否，只看个人主观，以及客观能不能达成。</p>

<p>李承晚之后的军政府，包括李承晚在内，都试图用强硬军事手段来维系政权稳固，而不是说李承晚就是军阀，这里语境本来就包括后来军政府。</p>

<p>威权是极权的根基，国家规模和内部斗争的程度决定了结果。</p>

<p>李承晚想镇压学生但失败了下台跑路，后续朴正熙就手段更狠，说明社会的形态仍然是高度威权化的。</p>

<p>而后续因为韩国体量小，经济在高速发展，社会观念开始转变，原本就存在的分权框架开始能逐渐有其实际意义，而不是纯粹橡皮图章。</p>

<p>实际上包括李承晚还是朴正熙在内，都压根不承认所谓法理，毛等人否定私产是马克思主义带来的意识形态，是更激进的做法，不意味着不否认私产的李承晚和朴正熙们就跟他们不是同一种政治生物。</p>

<p>我看不到朴正熙军事政变的时候哪里尊重法理，只是包括李承晚在内，历代韩国独裁属性强的政府，都无法做到绝对独裁，因为这个国家太小了，同时经济发展，无法形成这种解构。</p>

<p>所以朴正熙后期，再到他死后，韩国就渐渐开始有了来自于民间民主化的基础。</p>

<p>那么这个时候反过来看看，你主观判断出来的：</p>

<p><strong>您的政权什么德行，得看基层官兵（基本盘）的道德底线。所以基层官兵的支持很重要，他们的道德水平更重要。</strong></p>

<p>还存在吗？</p>

<p>军政府在光州事件里并没有因为军队士兵的个人道德，所以就不服从命令导致镇压无法执行，相比李承晚，这样反而算倒退了，这就是威权的进化到一定程度，出现了分歧。</p>

<p>一面是军政府的极端，一面是社会层面民众的进步思潮。</p>

<p>两个高峰同时出现，碰撞后的结果，则是全斗焕败退，背景是什么？</p>

<p>是韩国经济的现代化发展，社会基础带来了制度的落实，所以任何破坏社会经济与改革基础的，都只会让经济倒退，继续给威权主义生存空间。</p>

<p>事实上就算是士兵的个人道德进步，也是来自于经济发展，一旦资源不足，饭都吃不下去，就会回归到威权化的思维，</p>

<p>在服从命令跟喝水呼吸一样自然的军队里，依赖士兵个人道德，而不是去考虑什么让士兵愿意效忠，是本末倒置的思想。</p>

<p>虽然并不是说个人道德不能左右，但先有物质还是先有精神， 一目了然。</p>

<p>这也是为什么我说你想东西离地的原因。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“ 本身要么就是同情左翼，或者有家国情怀的人 ”</strong></p>

<p>宋荣两人经过种种考验入党，成为国家级领导人，在某种程度上已与政权高度契合，不是普通的同情者。霍英东只是跑腿的生意人。</p>

<p>吸收精英入党，进入统战体系，本身就是统战的一个环节。</p>

<p>你搞错了基本的因果关系。</p>

<p>是首先因为同情和左翼思想，参与了运动和组织当中，但游离于中共核心组织，才会有后来被统战，但这不代表他们是政权的决策层的一部分，共产党人更近似于组织上的荣誉身份，包括霍英东也是。</p>

<p>能调动人们在利益层面以外的主观能动性，本身就是意识形态靠拢的结果。</p>

<p>这是中国左右翼思潮斗争的体现，而不是中共自身如何如何，因为中共本身就是中国左翼的最终本土化产物。</p>

<p>左右翼都可以是威权政府，威权与左右翼是平行的两个轨迹。</p>

<p>威权与社会发展程度挂钩。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2004.37</strong> —–2023-03-29 23:15:55+08:00:</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>您可能希望生活在朱元璋或者陈友谅治下，我相对来说偏向偏安一隅的张士诚。</strong></p>

<p>张士诚偏安一隅是因为打不过朱元璋，而且张士诚根本不打算偏安，朱元璋派杨宪去通好，拿历史上偏安割据的军阀称赞他，还引起了张士诚的不悦。</p>

<p>张士诚也有派兵进攻朱元璋，打不赢后来环境恶化，被迫降元。</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>元璋遣儒士杨宪通好于张士诚，书略曰：“近闻足下兵由通州，遂有吴郡。昔隗嚣据天水以称雄，今足下据姑苏以自王，吾深为足下喜。吾与足下，东西境也，睦邻守国，保境息民，古人所贵，吾深慕焉。自今以后，通使往来，毋惑于交构之言以生边衅。”士诚得书，<strong>以此己于隗嚣，不悦</strong>，留宪不遣。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>查下隗嚣是谁就知道为什么张士诚不开心了。</p>

<p>在这里，朱元璋才是那个追求让张士诚割据的人，这样他有空腾出手来发展。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>要打您自己和您孩子去打。我没有争夺帝国的野心，也不想让别人送命。</strong></p>

<p>你想独立的这件事本身，就是在让别人送命，哪怕不打仗，你也要剥夺数以千万计的合法公民身份与权益来建造一个区别人民身份的主权国家。</p>

<p>这也是为什么你不正面谈这点和其深入细节、逻辑推演的原因。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>请别睁眼说瞎话。政坛瞬息万变，没有永远的朋友。苏联顾问帮助孙中山和浙江人蒋介石击败陈炯明，将其赶到香港。之后，孙废除了所有陈掌权时的自治政策。</strong></p>

<p>第一，你上面连张士诚在明代处于什么情况都不清楚，一大堆历史问题基本门槛都没到，后续也不认真查一下公开的资料去理解事实，我很难说你有什么见解称得上可谈。</p>

<p>第二，陈炯明跟苏联也有沟通交流，甚至比孙可能更支持左翼思潮。</p>

<p>第三，广东是孙中山的基本盘，不是陈炯明的，这也是为什么孙中山能赢，苏联军队又没传送到广东代打。</p>

<p>第四，陈炯明是孙中山的人，双方是主张有不同，而不是统一不统一。</p>

<p>我再强调一次，你追求的是独立主权，不是自治权，陈炯明追求的的统一下的自治权，更靠近于我而不是你。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“ 因为反对大一统，孙中山完成了，炮就打到孙中山头顶，张作霖要是完成了，就要骂张作霖了。 ”</strong></p>

<p><strong>第一，没错。谁掌握帝国骂谁。</strong></p>

<p>所以这一点证实了一件事，实锤你压根不追求地方分权和自治权，只是要求独立，拿民主化和地方自治当掩饰来推行自知不得人心的政治目标。</p>

<p>因为哪怕是一个高度分权民主化的地方自治国家，在你逻辑里也是帝国，但你也会双标否定现代所有发达国家，而唯独针对中国。</p>

<p>显然，是希望从中国的领土上建立一个主权民族国家，发明民族和无视法理。</p>

<p>而并不是真正意义上追求拆屋效应，去寻求更激进方案来逼迫人们接受相对温和的手段。</p>

<p>你自己主观定义的帝国，如果是民主的，也是该灭亡的。</p>

<p>你主观定义的独立，若是独裁的，你虽然嘴上不愿意说，但若你反对”帝国“而支持民主化的统一中国也活该灭亡，那也能看得出你是独立＞民主＞独裁</p>

<p>若有必要，独裁还可以大于民主，但是大家都知道民主化是政治正确。</p>

<p>自然你也没法大张旗鼓拿出来说宁肯地方独裁的独立，也不要统一的民主。</p>

<p>一旦说出口，就连反对统一的立场都没有了。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>第二，有错。孙中山不配跟张作霖比。张反苏，而且从没引出高度变态的列宁党制度，更没包容CCP，令本已险恶的政治环境进一步恶化。</strong></p>

<p>按你的逻辑推演，张作霖跟日本人合作，日本人入侵中国。</p>

<p>都是威权，苏联人的威权比日本人的威权更先进温和。</p>

<p>所以你认为日本人统治中国，比苏联间接干预更好？</p>

<p>如果没有日本人入侵，也无苏联在中国发展共产主义组织的可能，更无中共喘息的机会。</p>

<p>张作霖如果坚决与日本人对立，张学良抵抗下去，蒋介石是否又有多数年时间能用于剿共？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“ 那就是最优解 ”</strong></p>

<p><strong>” 手段有什么问题？“</strong></p>

<p><strong>在帝国主义者看来，是最优解。在真正的民主主义者和地方主义者看来，他的目标和手段没有一个符合地方自治和自由主义的。</strong></p>

<p>因为在经济未发展的威权主义社会，去追求自由主义，本身就是极其幼稚的，也不符合现实结果的。</p>

<p>我说了很多次了，你不可能在帝制时代搞民主，整个近代都是过渡，帝制是瞬间结束的，但社会不可能瞬间转变。</p>

<p>因此对比帝制，威权主义的共和制就是进步。</p>

<p>外力入侵和内部内卷竞争，促成威权政权不得不极端化。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>而且，自治就自治，党国一体训政算什么？还是专政思想在作怪。Dictators and their Secret Police （Greitens，2016） 挑明，列宁化的国民党所成立诸多特务机关散播恐怖肃杀气氛，将暗杀普遍化，正常化。</strong></p>

<p><strong>不仅如此，它们和宪兵出于削藩分拨破坏地方治安组织，降低其面对侵略以及赤化的免疫力。与此同时，它们彼此不通气不沟通，互相恶性竞争，造成海峡两岸的劫收惨案。</strong></p>

<p>同上，你一直不会引入变量，看历史和社会发展非常死板甚至压根没看明白。</p>

<p>因为当时是处于高度威权化社会，根本没有什么所谓的自治和地方民主化的经济与社会基础。</p>

<p>军阀有枪杆子，无视一切现代社会规律，袁世凯的行为，逼迫孙等人寻求二次革命。</p>

<p>这种意识形态和共同利益都无法达成的环境，孙中山的国民党成功北伐前，也根本就不存在稳定可言。</p>

<p>反而是这种威权化下人人有枪杆子的环境，既无经济发展的政治基础，也无稳定进步。</p>

<p>如果你能说服军阀放弃军队，让军队国家化，那自然可以谈地方自治。</p>

<p>你跟土皇帝谈放弃权力，为什么不去跟中共谈放弃权力还政于民呢？</p>

<p>因为土皇帝是割据一方无力做大，有什么所谓独立的苗头就对之暗暗赞赏偏袒，却全然不管这些人才是混乱的根源，合理么？</p>

<p>全球无一例外，任何没有经济基础的社会，威权化政府如果没有一个合适的接入点发展经济，在内外交困的情况下，都会出现极端化的情况。</p>

<p>所以发展经济和对外贸易，给社会公民提供稳定身份才是最关键的。</p>

<p>一切要剥夺这三点的，都是社会不稳定的来源和罪人。</p>

<p>所以我实在想不出，没有任何理由和民众支持，突然从国土建立一个主权民主国家，破坏经济，剥夺公民身份和合法权力，跟威权政权有什么区别。</p>

<p>如果你是在近代或者古代，我没什么好说的，但你是在现代社会，高度发达的工业化环境下。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>孙中山用的不是威权 authoritarian。军阀才是威权主义者。孙所引进的列宁党是极权主义 totalitarian 体制，改组后消灭北洋的国民党是半列宁式僭主党派 tyran。不仅不先进，还反动 reactionary。</strong></p>

<p>威权是极权的基础，然后是程度问题，孙中山是典型的威权政党，但不是刻板的威权主义者，明确提出了训政，但又有别于军阀，提出了宪政。</p>

<p>这一点已经根本性区分中共、军阀了，蒋介石虽然做的不好，但起码明面有按照孙中山的三部曲走。</p>

<p>再有就是很难理解你为什么刻意用英文的做法，中文已经足够交流，有时候甚至不是名词使用上减少分歧，而是一种习惯，难道你不太会用中文吗？还是说你已经脱离这个环境，不在中国了？因为根据前面的经验，一个德国顾问非要叙述成普鲁士容克阶级退休军阀的操作，就让我感到很尴尬了，不知道怎么吐槽。</p>

<p>同时，孙中山引入的党政体系，在威权社会的氛围下更先进，能更好处理事务，这也是为什么军阀们败退，最后来来去去都只有孙中山的徒子徒孙们在历史舞台上竞争。</p>

<p>区别在于，国民党和中共，都并没严格按照孙中山的路线执行到底，起码就政权属性而言，孙中山提出的路线是完全符合时代背景，并且优于后来的国共两党的路线的。</p>

<p>不但能包容左右不同阶级，还能允许地方自治，最终目标是制定宪法行宪。</p>

<p>历史就摆在那，建国纲领也在那，不是你说什么就是什么。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>而引入包容他们的是…….</strong></p>

<p>客观事实。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>从您对孙中山独裁行径百般谅解来看，和您所宣扬的相反，您心中，大一统大于分权法治。您，不在乎民主民生。重视民主民生，分权法治，得使用相配套的手段。而您毫不在乎。</strong></p>

<p>难绷，你前面自己都暴露了，现在还想扣我这个帽子？</p>

<p>不在乎民主民生，好，既然你这么说，那我们来看看。</p>

<p>就单独谈给你独立以后怎么处理国民身份待遇，你有时间花大量工夫跟我谈别的，我追问半天你才支支吾吾提了几句，稍微深入反驳你，马上就不再谈及。</p>

<p>自己是什么性质心里没数吗？</p>

<p>我不怕任何人质疑，我可以从最根基的逻辑和社会事实解释为什么不能和为什么应该这样做。</p>

<p>你连跟现实社会都高度脱节的说辞都拿的出来，不是为了独立而独立，难道是为了民主民生独立？</p>

<p>有人为了民主，却要剥夺数千万公民合法权益，这个人难道是我吗？</p>

<p>你都完全不敢深入谈这件事。</p>

<p>还非要扣我帽子。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>“ 你可以说我是专政的 ”</strong></p>

<p><strong>没错。</strong></p>

<p>所以只要不如你意，你可以说任何人是专政的。</p>

<p>你可以说任何人是，但你不会给我有任何自我辩护的权力。</p>

<p>而我会给你自我辩护的权力，并且从客观证据上证明你是错的。</p>

<p>这就是差异。</p>

<p>第二次难绷，孙中山的政治观点都直接写成纲领，你起码去查一查可以吗？</p>

<p>国民政府建国大纲，孙中山已经规划好了三部曲。</p>

<p>清除各地军阀，发展实业提供经济基础，给各地制定地方宪法，结束党治还政于民。</p>

<p>孙中山一百多年前的人，都知道制度落实需要经济基础，你一百多年后的现在都还没搞明白。</p>

<p>倒不如你自己说说，孙中山错在哪了？就因为不符合你脱离现实的政治臆想，所以就皇帝是好的，永远是其他人的错？</p>

<p>孙试图联合左右翼，从平民到商人、工农 ，还主张扫灭影响社会稳定的军阀，在各地制定地方法律进行高度自治。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>你知道你最恶心的一点是什么吗？</p>

<p>北伐之前，段祺瑞被拉来当临时执政，在善后会议给出的方案，是以各地军阀和实权者为主的最高权力机构。</p>

<p>孙中山对此提了两点：</p>

<p>第一， 善后会议能兼纳人民团体代表，为所云现代实业团体、商会、教育会、大学、各省学生联合会、工会、农会等。</p>

<p>第二，会议事项，虽可涉及率制财政，然而最后决定之权，不能不让立国民会议。”</p>

<p>从头到尾孙中山的重心都是在把权力推向更基层的广大民众，反而是你推崇的北洋各军阀，一直不想放权，希望在权力决策层做小圈子拉起来办事。</p>

<p>段祺瑞就拒绝了这两项提议。</p>

<p>仔细看下孙中山在北伐矛盾爆发前在当时的态度就知道了：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>使预备会议而能实现，则国内知识阶级如教育会、大学校学生联合会等，生产阶级如实业团体、农工商会等，皆得与有军事、政治之实力者相聚于一堂，以共谋国家建设之大计</strong>，既可使此<strong>会议能表示全民之利害情感</strong>，复可導<strong>国民于通力合作之途</strong>，<strong>民治前途必有良果</strong>。善后会议<strong>所列构成分子，则似偏于实力一方面</strong>，而于<strong>民意方面未免忽略</strong>，恐不能矫往辙、成新治，此鰓鰓之虑所为不安者也。固知于善后会议之后，尚有国民代表会议在；然国民代表会议由善后会议所诞生，則善后会议安可不慎之于始，況其<strong>所论议者尚广及军制、财政乎</strong>？</p>

<p>如果不是国民党自己正面战场打不过，中共对后方长期剿匪和打击，还乡团带来的问题，某些干部的问题，会直接把中共的基层管理空间压缩到影响政权生存的程度。</p>

<p><strong>蒋亲口承认” 也就不啻给予他渗透、潜伏、发展蔓延的大好机会“（苏俄在中国）。边区戒备森严，国民党很少长久潜伏。延安压根进不去。首先，地方无甚秘密，中央机要部门才是要害。其次，CCP钻国民党，反之不成立。最后，全中国身份模糊的双重间谍，基本上，给统战部卖力最大。</strong></p>

<p>国民党是主要政权和执政党，本身就是一个公开身份，两个政党的意识形态和组织架构大有不同。</p>

<p>知道戴案在建国后的波及吗？因为戴的单线联系，他死后国民党内部都不知道具体谁以及多少人的细节。</p>

<p>再有，别延安都压根进不去了，查一下不行吗？</p>

<p>汉训班出来的沈之岳，都做到了毛泽东秘书，在政治局内部负责机密要务，后来还被毛派去协调各种工作打算培育，因为推荐人暴露才跑路的，吴南山就是跳反后去延安开会时，发现特训班同学祁三益居然也在延安才让中共反应过来有问题。</p>

<p>603专案里发现至少670人潜伏，结果还有几百人不知身份，一直到现在都无法确认。</p>

<p>吴南山跳反挖出来的都只是冰山一角，说到底是因为国民党自己正面战场打不过，戴笠死后他们就永久性静默了，而不是长期潜伏与否的问题。</p>

<p><strong>十九世纪前欧洲哪个国家高度工业化了？但是英国瑞典就是比法国俄国因为各种原因权力更加分散，绝对主义更少一点。这就够了。</strong></p>

<p>到这里真没受不了，英国就是工业化的起源，你怎么还能问我哪个国家高度工业化了？大革命难道是一战前才发生的吗？瑞典可是一战时君主权力才彻底被夺走。</p>

<p>英国最早进行工业化改革，权利法案诞生时，就已经开始了早期工业化的苗头。</p>

<p>工业化说白了是生产力增长到一定质变的代名词和生产秩序，这也是为什么文艺复兴时期明明没工业化，但君权却普遍衰落，因为资产阶级兴起，到工业化开始更是突飞猛进。</p>

<p>瑞典跟法国比？瑞典到差不多十九世纪末二十世纪初，君主才很大程度上失去权力，1809宪法对君主权力的限制根本没有得到贯彻。</p>

<p>古斯塔夫五世在二十世纪初发表庭院演讲跟政府对立，一度还引发宪政危机，在此之后瑞典的君主权力才被彻底收回，比英国晚了近两百年。</p>

<p>俄罗斯远在东欧，本来就是工业化传播最慢的地区，没有什么好说的，他们自己不改革，工业化下不妥协跟进，庞大人口规模很快就造就了超级威权政府。</p>

<p>法国我也说过了，你特地注册账号专门杠我，起码也要搞清楚我说过什么吧。</p>

<p>任何人口多的国家，在威权上转型都是困难的，法国就是典型例子。</p>

<p>因为统治阶级的坚决不妥协或者延迟改革，导致问题不断被拖延做大，而庞大人口让社会转型困难，总有威权基础。</p>

<p>而实际上，拿破仑称帝后的君主制，已经也不是传统意义上的绝对君主制，更接近于保持帝号和法统的头衔，因为此时法国已经有了庞大的资产阶级和市民阶级。</p>

<p>因为法国的人口庞多，旧君主制度的改革缓慢和拖延，导致法国在这种改革过程里反反复复，但总体上他们的制度和社会是在进步的。</p>

<p>欧洲哪个国家不是从制衡权力的封建制走过来的，但唯独生产力发达能产生市民和资产阶级的才能更快从产生社会与制度变革。</p>

<p>你反对这一点，本身就是反智的，因为到这里资产阶级兴起推动制度改变的叙事不是我一个人的说法，而是全球历史学的共识。</p>

<p><strong>“ 就会进入土耳其靠凯末尔改革运动的军方等形式不断介入政治 ”</strong></p>

<p><strong>破产？我说的制衡就是武力制衡。只有像您这样的专制同情者和自由主义者在武力上达成恐怖平衡，大家才可能开始讲法律。魏玛的民主爱好者，比如社民党和中间党派，在军队根本没人。掌握武力的军人，威慑街头的德共和纳粹，三方是完全不喜欢民主的，侵略性十足的德意志国族主义者，所以在海内外大资本的支持下推翻了议会。土耳其16年以后还有政变吗？就是新一代认同选举的威权法西斯和老凯末尔主义者势力倒转了。</strong></p>

<p>那你怎么保证武力不被滥用？</p>

<p>现实历史的真实情况，就是压根没发生你所谓的制衡，各地军阀混战，府院之争让北方长期处于荒废无管制的状态。</p>

<p>哪怕一百多年后的今天，也被认为是二十世纪以来除抗日战争外，最混乱的时期。</p>

<p>已经给你实践过的机会了，并不是各地有武力后就和平相处，而是人人都会互相斗争，但你只怪赢了的国民党和孙中山，仅此而已。</p>

<p>追求民主化的组织需要有武装力量，避免任何保守和激进势力的干预，这叫做制衡。</p>

<p>大家都有武装，不代表政治理念能兼容，因为走中间和大众路线，如果最后回归到投票选举决定谁主导政权，必然会有人掀桌子。</p>

<p>原理推演很简单，你要独立，你也有客观事实的武装力量。</p>

<p>大家和平共处的前提是遵守同一套游戏规则，也即在一个桌子上谈事。</p>

<p>因此你要独立必须在这个规则内，按照游戏规则达成才行，因为你要独立出去的领土、民众都原本属于一个系统，他们有自己的合法权益需要被尊重。</p>

<p>所有人都是持份者。</p>

<p>基于这一点，我不允许你独立，单靠我的武装力量就算能打得过，也没有法理。</p>

<p>那么我作为更大规模政权下的持份者，就必须尊重选择，相对的，你也必须尊重，这叫做平等和制衡。</p>

<p>如果你不愿意走程序，想否定你希望独立地区国民的合法权力，这就叫破坏规则掀桌子。</p>

<p>这时候你就算有军队，也还是会发生战争，因为你的独立行为不合法，也没遵从当地民众、全国持份者的意愿，而我尊重这种意愿给你投票表决权了。</p>

<p>你一味认为靠武力制衡就能站得住脚，而不是遵从持份者与民意作为权力构成来源，这样的思想非常危险。</p>

<p>武力也要来自于人民出人出力出物资，如果你都不尊重程序和他们的利益，又怎么可能真是为民生而独立。</p>

<p>而且我不清楚所谓军工复合体到底是什么，所有人的利益都不会撒手。</p>

<p>重点是我们要实现什么？</p>

<p>我们这一代人要实现的，如果谈这个话题，首要是政治制度改革，只有政治制度形成了绝对优势的法理来源，施政才能通透清明。</p>

<p>若单方面受来自于各方利益的牵扯，就会举步艰难，因为这意味着你要负责的人包括了利益集团。</p>

<p>但你的主要靠山是选民时，你的施政广度就不需要注重那些集团。</p>

<p>同样的，假设一个这样的利益集团能支持政治改革，那自然是最好的，从历史来看，顺应社会生产力结构的变化，那他们就是站在我们这一边的。</p>

<p>然后就是基于法律下的内部矛盾，而不是政权生存的问题。</p>

<p>基本的逻辑道理，他们是否还是帝制？</p>

<p>如果用帝制时代的工业化来看，威权共和-民主体系，那就是工业化下的进步。</p>

<p>但是我们是现代人，所以我们用欧美的发达国家民主制水平来看发展中国家合格与否。</p>

<p>用现代人的民主标准去看一百年前的欧洲，也会发现不合格，一百年前的欧洲人眼里，绝对君主制就是落后和威权的体现。</p>

<p>我可以确信，未来一百年，这些国家只会更进步，而不是停留在一个威权阶段永久性不变，更不需要被拆解才来达成某种民主化，因为许多发达国家民主化也不需要。</p>

<p>中国很多地区落后不如他们的发达水平，就更加印证我所描述的，工业化与发达程度，决定了一个地区民主化的基础，而即便中国这些地区落后，也不是帝制的等级森严社会。</p>

<p><strong>2）您的理论偏决定论，解释不了为什么工业化程度不高的博茨瓦纳在主流民主指数排名榜单上（经济学人，Freedom House) 比很多OECD国家，包括新加坡，要高。</strong></p>

<p>因为民主指数是人定的，而不是一种客观现象。</p>

<p>到现在你居然还在用少数可以被解释的例子，去作为全部来阐述客观现象。</p>

<p>人定的就意味着只是参考指标，而不能解释现象，尤其是当它不是为了解释现象而建立的模型时。</p>

<p>就像中国，许多人，尤其是国内，也拿来宣传是民主制度的破产，证明了新的政治道路是可行的，当初是苏联，再上一个是纳粹德国。</p>

<p>说白了，历史尺度上，所有的观察都不可能忽略趋势和客观环境的，尤其是当人口与资源稀缺时不对称导致的问题。</p>

<p>但谁都知道，纳粹苏联都倒了，中国不可能不面临社会运动，只是时间问题，这也是为什么趋势的客观现象难以被解释，反而很多人认为福山的历史终结论错了，连他自己都要修正去针对性解释。</p>

<p>而且最重要的是，我前面已经说过很多次这类情况了，还问，那你专门注册一个账号就为了杠我的意义何在？</p>

<p>地理、人口这些都是一个国家的物理环境因素，这些我反反复复说了不知道多少次了。</p>

<p>从最基本的表象来看，博茨瓦纳的人均GDP也在泰国、北马其顿、南非这些国家之间，但是没有明显战乱，有丰富自然资源，最重要的是他们跟同样在民主指数前20的毛里求斯一样，是先有了殖民地制度建设，然后快速经济发展，直接对冲了任何潜在的冲突风险，且主体民族存在，更重要的是人口相对产业、资源来说很少。</p>

<p>所以，真的工业化程度不高吗？如果不高，没有形成稳定的资产和市民阶级，是怎么形成稳定的政治生态的？</p>

<p>最重要的是，博茨瓦纳是长期一党执政，博茨瓦纳民主党已经执政超过半个世纪了，早期运作本身就是威权民主到现代化民主过渡，这个过程里经济持续高速发展，不断巩固民主制度的事实，现在跟新加坡一样出现了反对党开始逐渐做大的情况，刚好印证了我说过的，社会的发展会为制度带来对民主有需求的阶级。</p>

<p>最后，收不上税是个物理问题，距离过远，许多税收是物资，无法运输，兑换成银两，明末缺银，明征税高，财政运转效率低，所以所谓的雁过拔毛，才是维持政府正常运作的模式。</p>

<p>【 <strong>服从代表一切。不是中央政权的一部分，为什么要服从？大跃进时期浙江省部分基层干部直接阳奉阴违，与百姓合作搞自留地，难道他们不算CCP治理体系的一部分了吗？</strong> 】</p>

<p>既然于中央治理体系不一，阳奉阴违，开始质疑起中央政策，又何来是治理体系的一部分？中央政令下达都不服从，甚至故意对着来了，你怎么还能得出是治理体系的一部分的结论。</p>

<p>【<strong>误把清末民初旧日统治机器崩溃所制造的基层政治真空视为中国农村历史常态。</strong>】</p>

<p>这就是中国古代农村的常态，这是一个常识问题。</p>

<p>因为古代根本不具备那种科技水平深入执行到每个地方，到明清征税都无法避免实物征税，甚至有工业化科技加持的共和国也无法避免，税收实现货币化是改革开放以后的事。</p>

<p>正因为银本位的建立困难，到明清交替才形成，所以税收才难以落实，长期存在徭役和实物税，清代因为银本位的建立，对农村的管治权已经有所进步，但仍然无法做到摆脱地主阶级，中共则是靠党委和地方村落，大部分取代了原来的地主和宗族体系。</p>

<p>而不是什么清末民初才有的基层政治真空，清代又不是没有信息记录，捻军和太平天国、白莲教，都是民间权力真空逐渐爆发起来的。</p>

<p><strong>民国知识分子留日留美是社会风气，留苏是革命党潜在工农干部集中短期培训。蒋介石送子赴苏是表忠心，不然当年他国民党左派的名声怎么来的？找德国人要钱要装备的时候不就把蒋纬国送当地了吗？</strong></p>

<p>苏联当时本来就是就近最适合的留学地点，就跟清末日本是国内留学圣地一样。</p>

<p>表什么忠心，表忠心还清党？</p>

<p>儿子前脚去，后脚就清党？</p>

<p>中央研究院近代史研究所的余敏铃早就已经写过文章说过这个情况。</p>

<p>蒋介石羡慕的是苏联的政党组织和制度水平，但是对苏联于中国的意图和资助很有怀疑，且认定不能实行共产主义。</p>

<p>蒋经国一开始留苏是自己的决定，并且遭到蒋介石反对，经陈洁如劝说后才同意。</p>

<p>什么年代了还需要人质，不想给你的就是不给你，蒋介石清党是还始终有踌躇。</p>

<p>清党是27年，跟德国合作26年就开始了，更早追溯孙中山时代中国已经开始与德国合作，蒋经国留学是25年，本来要去法国，因为一些事耽误了，后来他阴差阳错接触了俄罗斯人和苏联的事物，开始感兴趣想去苏联，这是哪门子的表忠心？</p>

<p>蒋纬国时，跟苏联已经无法完全信任，还能送他去吗？</p>

<p>【 <strong>添油加醋。“虚空”一词是您的吧。</strong> 】</p>

<p>我觉得对你用虚空这一次非常适用，一开始你还好歹回答一下，现在连质疑都不愿意回应。</p>

<p>是你先有了孙中山这些都是苏联走狗的观点，然后又要说。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>古今中外教导国民历史的方式，与历史研究不同，其实很幼稚，就是讲故事，好人坏人，主角配角。中国民主党派和无党派人士的高层和秘书处相当多人士不是双重党员就是同情者，内战时执行统战部命令，不骂毛和土改，专骂蒋和金圆券。这算好人？建国后他们的势力小到斯大林一死就被扫出国务院，长期被边缘化，文革时还被取缔。这算主角？</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>我给你那么多的不同回复，就哪怕不谈这一段已经彻底把你反驳了，我把你每句话都单独拆出来一句句给你捋清楚，那你都不愿意细说了，什么性质当别人不懂吗？玩不下去，自己找茬玩砸了，又拉不下来脸，因为一开始就是你自己来碰瓷和阴阳怪气的。</p>

<p>然后最可气的是，我一没阴阳怪气，二就事论事，三我在不同政治异见上比你更温和。</p>

<p>还我给你几天时间，你只选了其中 <strong>“ 而不是什么苏联有能力莫名其妙跑来虚空建立起一个体系”</strong> 这一段话来阴阳怪气。</p>

<p>就说你这个人别扭在什么地方。</p>

<p>你跟我不熟，还专门注册一个账号，三句不离我，给自己上什么发条一直找我抬杠还每次都被驳倒，我没挨个抓之前话柄数落你，就是我知道分寸的表现，也是你政治不成熟有问题的地方，因为不具备求同存异的认知。</p>

<p>既然不熟，你盯着我回复的用意又何在？</p>

<p>政治观点还是数据、历史事实，你都没争过，觉得丢脸了？我都没觉得怎么样，你自己到对我阴阳怪气来找平衡，不好吧。</p>

<p>到现在依然是不熟的话，何来一个人一边用您，一边阴阳怪气？这里就是你的问题了。</p>

<p>那么到底是什么情况，已经高下立判了，这种情况最近就个例子，有朋友提醒我说，有人为了否定另一人而批判他盲目崇拜，但为了达到这个目的，又必须特地去捧毛左臭脚，而毛左却是最乐于偶像崇拜的群体。</p>

<p>就这种事，实在难绷，尤其是如果这个人知道他赞同的是个毛左会怎么样。</p>

<p>属于为了某种目的，扭曲了自身，或者说趋同。</p>

<p><strong>1）言论和结社自由不是青天大老爷出于好意的施舍，而是天赋人权。请别暴露您对自由民主的真实理解。</strong></p>

<p>人出生皆自由，但需要承担对应后果，责任也是天赋人权。</p>

<p>结社自由不包括暴力或违法，更不包括非法侵害公民合法权益与财产。</p>

<p><strong>宋荣两人经过种种考验入党，成为国家级领导人，在某种程度上已与政权高度契合，不是普通的同情者。霍英东只是跑腿的生意人。还有，这三人哪个是您心心念念，幻想独挑共和国大梁的民主党派？</strong></p>

<p>你是不是这里有点问题？</p>

<p>我在给你举例，政权本身并非只有中共的存在，而是包括了大量非中共核心权力层的第三方，共和国是一个非常庞大的组织与集体，你莫名其妙重新解释成了<strong>幻想独挑共和国大梁的民主党派。</strong></p>

<p>这是不是说明你在看我回答的时候，是有选择性和敌意的。</p>

<p><strong>日本人欺负中国人不行，中国人欺负中国人就行？这不是双重标准吗？</strong></p>

<p>我看不出我哪里有描述过这种观点，我也不认为你能具体指出来。</p>

<p>如果我的确有，你具体的指出来。</p>

<p>在我看来，你试图独立但故意忽略无视该政策对民众的负面影响和苦难，也一样是在欺负中国人。</p>

<p><strong>况且中国人欺负还更厉害，内战韩战历次运动劳改义务劳动全是人间惨剧，是日本人的责任？</strong></p>

<p>这里反应一个问题，你把我放在中共的视角去批判，但事实就是虽然中共也是折腾中国人，但也比日本人强。</p>

<p><strong>让日本人统治，缺点和CCP一样多，起码私产不被否定。</strong></p>

<p>在日本人治下，中国人已经不能被当作法律定义上的人了，所以私有产权这种属于人的法律概念，在日本人统治的社会里也不适用于中国人，毕竟他们已经精细到不让吃特定食物了。</p>

<p><strong>货真价实的左派从不把狭隘的国族主义放在首位，阶级意识才是最重要的。至于统治阶级说什么语言，很重要吗？</strong></p>

<p>我不自诩左派，因此是实用主义者。</p>

<p>国族是客观存在的，你的否定在现实来说才是后冒出来没有群众基础的东西，我不能背离大众去倾向于你，你也不能背离大众，把自己的观念凌驾于大众福祉之上。</p>

<p>以日本统治阶级为例，对中国实行人畜分离政策，吃什么都要管，说什么语言也要控制，名字都要规范。</p>

<p>如果实行全面统治，按满洲国的做法，大概率把绝大部分汉人强制迁徙到边疆或农村，禁止使用现代工业产品，尤其是煤气水电，并且会定期屠杀定居点作为威慑，日本的屠城慑敌政策也是少有近代军队保留古代风俗的例子了。</p>

<p>从日本军国主义打算一亿玉碎，就算是日本人也只是可以牺牲的炮灰而已，被这种疯狗管制已经无法用理性去看待，起码可以确定国共虽然各有各的烂，但再烂国民们也知道与军国日本的区别。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-23~2023-01-29的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-23~2023-01-29的言论" /><published>2023-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1072.1</strong> —–2023-01-23 16:29:20+08:00:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that kind of grand comparative history doesn’t really exist, at least in the wider historiographical consciousness. The ‘Great Divergence’ in economic productivity, as it is sometimes called, is essentially purely one of Europe vs the Middle East, East Asia, and South Asia; Central Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas are all considered peripheral to that. The irony, of course, is that surely the ‘Greater’ divergence would therefore be that between Eurasia and the rest of the world, before Eurasia itself bifurcated into a more ‘dynamic’ West and more ‘stagnant’ East, but, well…</p>

<p>So what you end up with is that a lot of the <em>good</em> comparative history doesn’t attempt to answer your question, whereas what <em>does</em> try to answer your question – at least, from the broader, systematic perspective of why there were emerging divergences in economic power, military technology, organising capacity, and such – tends to be bad. There’s a few exceptions of course, and I’d recommend, as one option, James Belich’s recent book <em>The World the Plague Made</em>, albeit as a <em>perspective</em> rather than as a definitive statement. There are some economic historians who take umbrage with his numbers, and his argument also rests on the not-uncontroversial position that the evidence for the Black Death in China and India is relatively tenuous. I will also note a personal bias in that he’s one of my professors. But, that all being said, it is at least an attempt at the ‘Why Europe’ question in grand geographical and chronological scope that comes from someone with a background in the historical method.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1072.2</strong> —–2023-01-23 21:55:12+08:00:</p>

<p>I wonder if you’re misapprehending /u/Ramses_IV’s point here, which is not that popular history deserves no credit, but rather that it is not creditable for an author or work to <em>only</em> draw attention to a topic if its presentation of that topic is flawed and if the most obvious follow-ups are as well. It’s not that people shouldn’t write biographies of Charlemagne for a popular audience; rather it’s that people shouldn’t get credit <em>for</em> writing them for a popular audience, people should get credit for them being <em>good history</em>.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1072.3</strong> —–2023-01-24 07:46:39+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s worth adding that the two milhist books you mention there are, er, not unambiguously well-acclaimed. To quote the more critical parts of some reviews of <em>Special Operations in the Age of Chivalry</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Errors in analysis and data reduce the persuasiveness of the book… Moreover, the final notes to each chapter contain the line, ‘based on the following sources,’ which is then followed by a litany of studies and accounts in no particular order. It is thus impossible for the reader to correlate the author’s claims to his data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– John Hosler</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But can medieval special operations be so readily identified? One difficulty is that, with the possible exception of the Nizari assassins of the Middle East, there were no medieval equivalents to modern ‘special forces’. Another arises from the fact that, as the character of war changed in the twentieth century, so too did the relationship between special operations and ‘regular’ forms of military effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Andrew Ayton</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not easy to generalise from the varied kinds of military actions considered in this book. One of the arguments is that technological change, particularly the advent of gunpowder, had little impact; another is that special operations had a particular importance in siege warfare. Does the type of warfare analysed in this book deserve special treatment? Part of the case is that ‘most medieval special operations have been forgotten’, but not all the types of action discussed have sufficient in common to warrant being lumped together as a specific category. This is, however, a wide-ranging study, which sets medieval warfare in a novel perspective. The relevance of some of the films listed in the bibliography, such as Star Wars and Twelve Monkeys, is not immediately clear to this reviewer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Michael Prestwich</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fifty years ago, those who wrote about military history, often soldiers themselves, tried to analyze medieval warfare in the terms of its modern-day counterpart. This book is reminiscent of that type of writing – on finding some similarities between how people fought 500 years ago and today, the author tries to explain medieval warfare in a way that can be recognized as something like what we see today. But the argument in this case is stretched too thin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Peter Konieczny</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The book does not, however, move much beyond detail. It lacks a coherent narrative and analytical framework… Moreover, the author’s examples of special operations do not quite fit his own definition. He notes in the introduction that they involved four basic features: destroying infrastructure, eliminating weapons systems, killing and capturing individuals, and attacking symbols (p. 4). Later, however, he excludes weapons systems on the grounds that they do not apply (p. 34) to the Middle Ages since they were of little importance. He observes in the same place that although special operations existed during the period, there were no special forces to carry them out. The distinction between killing and capturing individuals and attacking symbols seems to fall apart of its own weight, as the author repeatedly shows with his examples that the former involved the latter in the Middle Ages. All this raises the question, why bother with the term, which seems more relevant to the present than the past. Or perhaps we can invoke the author’s own caution with respect to the ambiguities and complexities of naval warfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Renaissance Military Memoirs</em> actually has quite a few more supporters, especially in that it is more a work of literary than military history, and appears to pull that off well. That said, the comparative approach he uses wasn’t universally acclaimed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The book uses a fundamentally anachronistic and ahistoric approach, as Harari repeatedly juxtaposes examples from twentieth-century memoirs with passages from Renaissance memoirs. The author assures his readers that approach ‘may seem to be dangerously anachronistic, but… is in fact the best safeguard against the danger of anachronism’ (18). This technique produces endless frustratingly facile or misleading contrasts between Renaissance memoirs and modern texts, such as: ‘whereas the normal mode of the description in twentieth-century junior-ranks memoirs is experiential, in Renaissance memoirs it is factual’ (71). When confronted with Renaissance memoirs that do not fit into his categories, Harari scoffs that ‘such exceptional descriptions merely prove the rule’ (81). The depth of the author’s ahistoric attitude can readily be seen in the presentation of the historian’s craft: ‘the cornerstone of late-modern historiography is abstractions such as “Protestant ethics gave rise to Capitalism”’ (105). The book abounds with absurd pronouncements such as, ‘At least two of the most important twentieth-century wars, World War I and Vietnam, have memoirs rather than a history’ (185).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, it’s not that he hasn’t made an interesting contribution or two: ‘The Concept of ‘Decisive Battles’ in World History’ is, in my view, a reasonably cromulent read. But essentially only one of his two books before the pivot to evo-psych was particularly well-regarded.</p>

<p>Is it? This is, I kid you not, the <em>first time</em> I have seen that explanation, and I’ve done a decent amount of study on the Great Divergence thesis over the past few months. That’s anecdotal of course, but the fact I cannot name a single historian in the last 20 years to have proposed that is telling as to how mainstream that view is.</p>

<p>Stephen Platt’s <em>Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom</em>, hands-down. It’s meticulously researched, extremely well-written, and historiographically innovative. If I were to be asked what one book to read on the Taiping, this would be it. Now, its coverage is decidedly incomplete. It does not cover the leadup to the uprising in the 1840s, nor its first nine years or so from 1851-59. What it does do is narrate, in meticulous detail, the last five years of the Taiping War, in which the Taiping sought to gain control of Shanghai while as Qing gradually pushed downriver along the Yangtze towards their capital at Nanjing. The key thing is it is fundamentally a connected history. The resurgence of the Taiping in 1860 is placed in a context with the concluding phases of the Qing defeat in the Arrow War against Britain and France; the British decision to tacitly, and later actively, support the Qing is considered in conjunction with British approaches to ‘neutrality’ in the concurrent American Civil War. The Taiping can often be trivialised as a curiosity of Chinese history, but Platt manages to reframe it as a key event of <em>global</em> history.</p>

<p>It’s popular in the sense of being intended for a general rather than a narrowly academic audience. It’s published by a trade press, it has a narrative format, it uses end- rather than footnotes (though that’s not uncommon in academic press books either), and so on. It just happens to also be written by an academic and provide a fresh perspective that enhances our academic understanding.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1074.3</strong> —–2023-01-24 06:43:48+08:00:</p>

<p>I would consider it to be popular history written by an academic, yes. My benchmark is not to do with provenance but rather to do with intended audience: generally speaking, a narrative history published via a trade press is going to be intended to be both affordable and approachable to the general public in a way that an analytical history via an academic press will not.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1074.4</strong> —–2023-03-20 02:22:22+08:00:</p>

<p>It hasn’t been as overtly impactful, but it still is a very good read based on what seems to be a justified reading of considerable primary evidence. I think the key caveat it’s worth remembering that it is not a history of the Opium War itself, but rather about Sino-British relations.</p>

<p>I mean, a good chunk of those fields – even if not those specific ones, Xinjiang in general – are being farmed by slave labour, or near-equivalents like prison labour, conscripted from the internment camps. It’s hardly some kind of whataboutism. Like, if you saw a photo of an 1850s plantation in the American south, it’d hardly be inappropriate to mention slavery if it wasn’t highlighted in the original post.</p>

<p>‘Free countries’ ideally recognise that international cooperation is preferable to militarisation and brinkmanship. This is why there are things like the Schengen Area, which is a case of several countries undefending their borders so much they don’t even have civilian border controls with each other.</p>

<p>Also, ‘leave border regions undeveloped’ is a hell of a way to frame ‘not doing a colonialism by deliberately migrating a favoured population into a region while committing cultural genocide against its indigenous people.’</p>

<p>—– <strong>1077.4</strong> —–2023-01-24 08:41:35+08:00:</p>

<p>I mean there’s any number of reasons to do it, but if China is looking at things in terms of having a stronger border, then yes, expanding it economically offsets the cost of administrative and military strengthening. The economic side of things is made more efficient by having cheap Uighur and Kazakh labour thanks to being able to essentially conscript prison labour from the interment camps, of course, but that doesn’t inherently mean farming up against the border is beneficial.</p>

<p>If by ‘savvy’ you mean ‘an effective method of colonialism whereby Han Chinese people are transplanted to outpopulate Kazakhs and Uighurs, at the same time that there are programmes of cultural genocide <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-weekend-reads-china-health-269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c">and literal eugenicist policies to force abortions and sterilisations of Uighurs</a>, then sure, it’s ‘savvy’, but I will not give China that ‘credit’.

<p>As for the word ‘colonialism’, it absolutely is. Historians have been using colonialism to describe Chinese policies on Taiwan, in southeast China, in Tibet, in Mongolia, in Manchuria, and in Xinjiang for at least the last 2 decades. Colonialism isn’t just what white Europeans do to people who aren’t white Europeans. When China settles Han Chinese people in Xinjiang, blows up mosques, and rounds up Uighurs and Kazakhs into ‘re-education’ camps, that’s textbook colonial policy, just with the technology of modern totalitarianism.</p>

<p>As an addendum, Peter Perdue has made the case that the expansion of the secret memorial system and the establishment of the Grand Council were closely linked with the Qing military effort in Central Asia. The Grand Council was, of course, officially the <em>Junjichu</em> 軍機處 or ‘Department of Military Secrets’. While their function was to circumvent the more traditionally Han-run, Ming-era inheritances in the Qing civil service, it was made imperative by the costly, and largely Manchu-run, Inner Asian-interested campaigns the Qing waged on their western and northern frontiers. Hence, among other things, the almost exclusively Banner makeup of the Grand Council in its early iterations.</p>

<p>Peter Perdue’s <em>China Marches West</em> (2005) goes into this in more detail than I do here; as an addendum on matters in China Proper and the ‘inner’ vs ‘outer’ court, Wensheng Wang’s <em>White Lotus Rebels and South China Pirates</em> (2014) is the book to read on the Jiaqing-era reforms to Qing political mechanisms and the ideological struggle over the balance of power between the two.</p>

<p>When was the classic ‘pith helmet’ pattern of Foreign Service Helmet introduced in the British military? I’m aware of the older ‘air-pipe’ type being used in India, China, and East Africa from at least 1857 to 1868, but I don’t know when the version without the raised vent spine was used. On a related note, was this style of helmet also worn by Royal Navy personnel, or just the Army?</p>

<p>Jean Chesneaux’s edited volume <em>Popular Movements and Secret Societies in China, 1840-1950</em> is a bit old, but it covers quite a lot of the late Qing secret societies and I think is worth a read. Dian Murray’s <em>The Origins of the Tiandihui</em> is an in-depth look specifically at the Heaven and Earth Society, the antecedent to the Triads, which for the mid-nineteenth century was certainly one of the more influential entities. David Ownby’s <em>Brotherhood and Secret Societies in Early and Mid-Qing China: The Formation of a Tradition</em> is one I haven’t read but covers a slightly broader period. Ownby’s edited volume with Mary Heidhues and others, <em>Secret Societies Reconsidered: Perspectives on the Social History of Early Modern China and Southeast Asia</em>, is probably one of the better modern works on the subject, but it does focus mainly on the Southeast Asian cases over the well-trodden grounds of Chinese societies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the standard infantryman didn’t aim as we know it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t wholly true, although I admit I’m not familiar with the possibility of changes by the Napoleonic wars: <a href="https://twitter.com/RobbieMacNiven/status/1614995851713339393">1770s British manuals routinely refer to the bayonet lug as a ‘sight’</a>, which certainly implies that the ordinary musketeer would have been aiming with it.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1080.2</strong> —–2023-01-27 02:43:45+08:00:</p>

<p>To quote the 1764 publication <em>A Manual of Military Exercise and Commonly Practiced Manoevres</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Front Rank (Kneeling).<br />
…<br />
Present !<br />
Bring the Firelock briskly down to the Present, by extending the left Arm to the full Length with a strong Motion ; at the same Time spring up the Butt by the Cock with the right Hand, and raise up the butt so high upon the right Shoulder, that you may not be obliged to stoop too much with the Head, the right Cheek to be close to the Butt, and the left Eye shut, and look along the Barrel with the right Eye from the Breech Pin to the Muzzle ; keep the left Elbow down in an easy Position, and stand as steady as possible, the Thumb of the right Hand to remain in the Position as described in the third Explanation of the Manual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems pretty unambiguous that when volley firing, you were supposed to use parts of the gun to aim at the enemy rather than just pointing it in a general direction.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1080.3</strong> —–2023-01-27 07:33:21+08:00:</p>

<p>We are in fact referring simply to different parts of the same 1764 manual. My quotation is from page 26, which is part of the more elaborated-upon set of drills, while yours is from pages 1-2, in the shorter introductory segment. That aiming is not specified in the introductory segment would imply to me that it would have been readily intuitive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I’m not sure if we’re speaking of the same 46% here, but 46% was the accuracy achieved at 150 paces <a href="http://kabinettskriege.blogspot.com/2016/02/how-accurate-were-regular-soldiers-in.html">during Prussian volley fire trials</a>.</p>

<p>I’m simply very doubtful of the claim that you didn’t aim to hit – simply <em>trying</em> to be somewhat on-target, in the window you had between ‘Present!’ and ‘Fire!’, would have been a trivial action that would have paid off, and that is precisely why it was done.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nijisanji, Japanese member Gwelu Os Gar is <a href="https://twitter.com/nijisanji_app/status/1620315958547218432">returning from hiatus tomorrow</a> after a nearly 6-week suspension, possibly self-initiated, following his posting of a cover of a song parodying fans of Hololive’s Usada Pekora, to the significant and understandable consternation of said fans. Gwelu had claimed that Pekora’s acknowledgement of said song constituted blanket approval of its use, which is… a take, and led to some wondering if, and crucially how, management actually signed off on this. Nijisanji’s message announcing his return today explicitly stated that he ‘has committed dishonest acts’ (不誠実な言動を行ったため), which is a pretty public castigation.</p>

<p>This <em>also</em> comes amid the recent… mixed reception of a stream by NijiEN’s Millie Parfait <em>attempting</em> to mock various Internet rumours, as discussed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/10o8x58/hobby_scuffles_week_of_january_30_2023/j6f5g4d/">earlier in this thread</a> by /u/OPUno.</p>

<p>So yeah, needless to say things are <em>weird</em> in VTuberland at the moment.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1085.3</strong> —–2023-02-03 06:12:30+08:00:</p>

<p>Not just that, we’ve seen Indonesian talents – some but not all – complaining about not being forwarded their fanmail, and Nijisanji’s official Twitter explicitly accusing a member of having ‘committed dishonest acts’ as the cause of their recently-concluded suspension. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/10o8x58/hobby_scuffles_week_of_january_30_2023/j6ogwsf/">Both are summarised and linked to here.</a></p>

<p>—– <strong>1085.4</strong> —–2023-02-03 07:52:30+08:00:</p>

<p>The Poirot adaptations starring Peter Ustinov are generally considered a mixed bag. <em>Death on the Nile</em> and <em>Evil Under the Sun</em> are regarded as decent but a bit below the later Suchet-starring adaptations, while <em>Thirteen at Dinner</em>, <em>Dead Man’s Folly</em>, <em>Murder in Three Acts</em>, and <em>Appointment with Death</em> are not by and large thought of as <em>bad</em>, but are considered somewhat ‘meh’. They’re <em>weird</em> or at least different, especially inasmuch as the three TV films (<em>Thirteen</em> through <em>Three Acts</em>) relocate the setting to the 1980s and also have a more Americanised cast, and there are one or two rather odd adaptational changes. And the theatrical ones also have a few alterations that are not <em>bad</em> per se but do stand out to some. But, having watched all of the Suchet adaptations (save for <em>The Lost Mine</em> because <em>ho boy</em> the racism), I decided to have a look at the Ustinov ones.</p>

<p>To be honest, I do not think they’re that bad, or even bad at all. I don’t generally mind some creative license in terms of setting, casting, and so on, that really tends not to bother me. What did rub me the wrong way was how <em>Death on the Nile</em> employed the well-worn and, shall we say, deeply problematic device of Indian characters with exaggerated accents and mannerisms for comic relief – Mr Choudhury, the cruise manager on the <em>Karnak</em> played by I.S. Johar; and an unnamed staff member on the ship in an uncredited cameo by Saeed Jaffrey, who discovers the second murder. But as another user of this subreddit can attest, whatever the qualities of the adaptations on the whole, Peter Ustinov absolutely <em>nails</em> Poirot. It’s a <em>different</em> interpretation than Suchet, but it is still a cromulent, fully-realised one, and it’s not hard to see why Suchet thought that Ustinov very well could have established his performance as the definitive rendition.</p>

<p>It will also never not be amusing seeing Suchet play Inspector Japp in <em>Thirteen at Dinner</em>, 15 years before playing Poirot in another adaptation of the same story.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1085.5</strong> —–2023-02-03 10:30:44+08:00:</p>

<p>Speaking as someone whose familiarity with NijiEN is quite poor outside the odd Selen stream, I nevertheless find this all quite bewildering.</p>

<p>The first thing is the timeline: First off, a trailer dropped, and then the announcement of ‘cancellation’ (instead of postponement as at least some of the talents have stated it is) came a mere <em>11 days</em> later. Secondly, while it cites covid as a reason, which is not inherently implausible, the sheer vagary sticks out. It is <em>very</em> difficult to grasp why that would manage to impose a sufficient delay that the event in question – whose original scheduled date would still have been over 2 months away as of writing – can’t even be definitively rescheduled. By the time you have a trailer, you really <em>ought</em> to be confident that your event can and will go ahead.</p>

<p>The second is the existence of those tweets: They indicate to me that the talents, who appear to have known that an announcement of postponement/cancellation was coming, were <em>heavily</em> blindsided by the <em>nature</em> of that announcement. While I appreciate the notion that this is deeply unprofessional, it’s also not unlikely that Nijisanji’s internal communications are not in great shape. The fact that NijiID members recently publicly tweeted about their not being forwarded fanmail, that implies that recourse within internal management structures either hadn’t been forthcoming in that instance, or that prior precedent had indicated that would be probable. Either way, not a great situation to be in, and I can understand if there had been increasing strains internally that are just now boiling over.</p>]]></content><author><name>EnclavedMicrostate</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spinkcat在2023-01-23~2023-01-29的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/Spinkcat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spinkcat在2023-01-23~2023-01-29的言论" /><published>2023-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/Spinkcat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/Spinkcat/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1994.1</strong> —–2023-01-24 04:54:43+08:00:</p>

<p>任何文化产业发展，都依赖于人口从农业社会转型工业社会时爆发出来的上升力。</p>

<p>一个国家在这个时候既有年轻的人口构成，也有未拓展的文化版图，还持有传统文化在身。</p>

<p>这种多类型文化构成的社会潜力十足，经济带来了消费上的活跃，年轻人的思考，对过去与未来的诠释，创造了全新类型的文化。</p>

<p>日本动漫就是一个再典型不过的产物，但是随着人口老龄化到来，经济发展潜力到头，这种完全新兴的文化发展就逐渐陷入低增长时期，一些主要的文化概念基本都在上个世纪出现完毕。</p>

<p>所以这就带来了一个疑问，文化产业的发展，是不是一旦错过或者发展完成了，相当一段时间里都不会再出现。</p>

<p>日韩都很好抓住了这个文化产业的上升期，做到了将自己的文化标签伴随经济成长，一起融入和推广到全世界，成为标志性的流行文化。</p>

<p>而中国也许在中共的拘束下，可能已经永远错过了这种机会，人口老龄化意味着即便中共退出历史舞台，他们对中华民族文化的伤害也是永久性不可逆的，主观上的政治需求，倒闭文化退化，让中国在文化升级与推广的关键期失之交臂，导致我们成为东亚三国里唯一没有日韩对应的经济-文化黄金双周期的存在。</p>

<p>这种永久性不可逆的文化伤害，或许会导致中国在未来不止是经济主导权上被边缘化，更重要的是国际文化上的边缘化，让中国地区诞生的原生文化成为一个长期弱势，位置较低的非主流文化。</p>

<p>过去那些年经济增长时，一度有进入主流视野的倾向，但近年又开始回落。</p>

<p>其实看日韩可以知道，他们也不是靠传统文化走出去的，始终是年轻一代在创造文化，然后对自己国家传统文化的再解构和利用要素，拼接出来的也是包装后的新产物，比如武士和忍者文化，但武士和忍者文化不是靠剑戟片走向全球。</p>

<p>相反日本自身对文化的解构与新诠释就很神奇，他们对外来文化有很强的融合能力，不做作就能做出让人在文化感受上接受程度高且很自然的文化产品，这是我们应该学习的，恰巧现在这种对文化的解释权被垄断在官方手里。</p>

<p>而我们的人口老龄化问题非常严重，未来更糟糕，如果不能在产业升级的最后窗口期，抓紧剩下这点经济红利去创造新时代的文化，而不是反复唠叨传统文化的遗产，那我们很可能会在二十一世纪道二十二世纪中叶都处于一种去全球文明和文化上的边缘人。</p>

<p>看着后来居上的越南、印度、乃至中东非洲等国，都出现了能融入全球的现象现象级文化，就会重蹈苏联覆辙，俄罗斯未来可见的几十年都会处于经济与文化的边缘人位置，我们也因为中共的拘束处于这样的不利状况。</p>

<p>问题最严重的地方就在于，发展是个有时效性的东西，一旦错过了，就算中共滚蛋，也无法补救。我们这个国家从农业社会的儿童期，转型到工业社会的过渡青春期正在一点点结束。</p>

<p>就跟一个人青春期如果缺乏营养，错过了，一辈子也长不回来。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.2</strong> —–2023-01-24 14:29:56+08:00:</p>

<p>那你看看有没有一直由老年人主导创造流行文化的社会。</p>

<p>这个答案其实非常简单，远的都不用说，就近几年国内的网络梗，蔡徐坤、马保国、东北往事，全都是年轻一代的产物。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.3</strong> —–2023-01-24 15:32:27+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>太深刻了，进入工业社会传统文化就凭空消失了，发达国家不发展文化，文化发展还得看咱发展中国家</p>
</blockquote>

<p>因为文化的出现和存在依附于个体与社会整体的生产方式，十八到十九世纪，欧美非常流行戴帽子，一直到二十世纪早期也很常见，然后慢慢没落。</p>

<p>阿米什人这样用旧生产力方式坚持传统的族群就是个活例子。</p>

<p>再举一个例子，忠字舞从秧歌舞逐渐演化而来，而这种文化形式后来又逐渐有部分往广场舞发展，一旦生产方式改变，脱离过去的环境，一些依附于某一阶段的生产方式所诞生的文化，就会渐渐消失。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>深刻，进入工业社会的中国不如转型中的中国文化影响力大，昨天是最好的一天，s大真的善于一本正经说一些和事实相反的话</p>

  <p>是那个题材就那么多水，挤完了就没新意了，要去开发下一个形式，和经济、人口老龄化关系很小，和有多少水、多戳观众G点关系很大，同质产品你不做有人去做。</p>

  <p>文化传播就是大家以前没见过这套把戏、异域风情，看过后喜欢上了，就传播开了。流行内容交替的原因是下一个更有意思的东西出现了，大家时间有限，挤了你的生态位，而不是因为你国人口老龄化了</p>
</blockquote>

<p>姜文、张艺谋、李雪健、葛优、冯小刚、陈凯歌这些人在职业生涯上快速发展的时候，是改革开放后到两千年早期，这个时期的转型力度是最大的。</p>

<p>现在即便他们还在，但是很难创作出跟当年一样的作品，除了他们自身年纪大的状态下滑，也包括了他们所需的制作班底能力下滑。</p>

<p>最经典的例子，四大名著的拍摄，技术资金都在进步，但是作为影视剧的内核，反而是难以比拟的。即便不看四大名著，看大宅门的拍摄，就算是同一个导演自己拍，也拍不出原来的水平，更别提央视自己了。</p>

<p>从古代文化的衰退可以看出来，即便当时再好，社会环境一定改变，顶替上来的永远都是新东西，唐诗宋词之间的过渡到现代的衰退也可见一斑。</p>

<p>包括港台也是，在香港开始早期工业化的短短几十年里，哪怕不去看邵氏的成就影响，也出现了李小龙、四大天王、双周一成再到张国荣、梁朝伟、许冠杰、林青霞、邓丽君等等的艺术创作者。</p>

<p>目前中国影视界基本都还是这一群人在承担主导角色，但同样的香港，同样的大陆，同样的台湾，出不来这些人才，更别提他们的作品了。</p>

<p>并不是我们单方面的主观怀念过去，而是过去仍然存在于当下，时间跨度没有带来跟过去一样的杰出人才，而恰巧这些人蓬勃发展与冒头，都是诞生自社会生产秩序转型的上升期。</p>

<p>也不是说现在没有新一代演员和好作品，但是比例和影响力的差距是显而易见。</p>

<p>横向去看日本，全球流行最广的次文化起源地之一，以动漫为例，押井守、宫崎骏、富野大光头、大友克洋等等，都是在日本经济蓬勃发展的转型上升期开始进入大众视野，七十年代到九十年代（甚至可以延续到两千年初），就是日本现代文化形成与爆发式增长的一个关键时期。</p>

<p>晚一些的庵野秀明贡献了现象级的作品，漫画家上例子太多就不一一举例了，三浦、鸟山明等等天才，他们定下的路数都是成为后来作品参考的主要来源。当然也包括游戏层面，任天堂的崛起，在游戏产业上塑造了世界性的话语权。</p>

<p>他们创造或者拓展的文化，都不是日本的传统文化，相反相当多都成为了现在流行文化里“传统”的那部分，并且新一代的演化，仍然没有超出他们的框架，甚至有倒退的痕迹，新海诚已经是新一代里很不错的了，经济成就有目共睹，但对比过去的巨人仍然难以从创作和创造文化的角度企及，漫画产业更是青黄不接。</p>

<p>画的好的人越来越多，但创造性的内容越来越少，一个异世界的模板反复用到烂，能吸引人的只能是模板套搞笑桥段，更别提现在动画产业作画上的倒退，这种倒退就像过去能拍出霸王别姬的陈凯歌，现在拍的一塌糊涂一样，退化的不止是个人，还有整个产业。</p>

<p>过去并不是套模板，而是不断发明模板，相反只能不断套模板的情况在现在反而普遍化，过去时代也有很多素质很差或者抄袭的作品，但并不影响新事物和文化的诞生。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>那个题材就那么多水，挤完了就没新意了</p>

  <p>文化传播就是大家以前没见过这套把戏、异域风情，看过后喜欢上了，就传播开了。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>那么问题来了，“把戏”又是从何而来，任何文化的表达都需要有内在自我的逻辑自洽性，人们的创造决定了文化的诞生，就像特摄片一样，把原本技术不足的手段，直接变成了一种特定的文化产品，没有什么是凭空诞生的。</p>

<p>如果溯源，总是会找到一定继承痕迹，但在这个继承基础上，这些文化创作者又能搞出新东西，然后演化成新文化，现在套皮游戏、动漫和非常死板的电影拍摄技巧并不是理所当然的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>顺便，要是人多就是力量大，那毛泽东就是中华上下五千年第一伟人，因为他的生育政策给中国带来了5e人口增量，冷血点看饥荒文革相比这个就是毛毛雨</p>
</blockquote>

<p>也并不是人多力量大，一个国家如果10亿老人，2亿年轻人，还是会一潭死水。</p>

<p>因为人变老带来的技巧、思维固化，是一种物理和生理困境。</p>

<p>一个人的价值观、行为模式与取向，在青年时代会逐渐定型，并且如无意外都会延续用到死，他们会认知与使用的文化也会固定在他们青年到中年这段时间的偏好。</p>

<p>而新生儿、孩子出生是没有固定模板，他们会根据自己的理解对已有事物进行再解读，并且在这个过程里发明创造，这也是为什么青年到中年时期是一个人创作能力的高峰。</p>

<p>社会文化的迭新需要更多年轻人口与经济发展，而不是单纯人多。</p>

<p>毛时代就算人口增长10亿，没有对应的经济发展和改革，张艺谋这群人这辈子也没机会拍好作品，那为什么偏偏是农业社会转型工业社会的上升期很关键？</p>

<p>农业社会依赖于人口作为基本生产单位，缺乏工业化下反而需要更多人口作为耕种的劳动力，因此农业社会往往有一家生七八个甚至十来个的情况，因此农业社会化的比例越高，该社会的人口构成中年轻人的比例也越高。</p>

<p>工业社会的育儿成本高涨，导致很多夫妻不生育，但有充足的技术、资源可以给年轻人口发展，在这个发展的过程里，无论工业产业还是文化产业，都会迸发出大量的新事物。</p>

<p>但是一旦接受了工业社会的全部，社会又将回归到工业化必然出现的低生育现象，无法跟农业社会转型期提供婴儿潮，从而带来大量无既定观念的年轻人口，进而引发新生人口数量不足，产业没有新人，部分技巧甚至失传。文化的发展仍然在继续，只是变得非常慢。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.4</strong> —–2023-01-24 15:44:17+08:00:</p>

<p>文化碰撞与大型历史事件当然会带来文化的大规模变化，因为这意味着人口的更替与交融，因为文化本身就是依托自人类个体与族群所产生的。</p>

<p>农业社会到工业社会的转型逻辑在于，农业社会依赖人的个体作为生产力基本单位，导致大量生育人口，而又缺乏足够技术供养老年人口，这样的社会人口结构永远是偏年轻的。</p>

<p>工业社会反过来，有足够资源供养老年人口，但更重要的还是生育率低，不像老年人一样受年轻时接触的文化与价值观影响的新生人口数量骤减，因此工业社会里不靠外来的资源与人口输入，很难单纯通过社会本身去扭转这种局面。</p>

<p>而恰巧农业转型工业时，既提供了农业的人口优势，也保有工业社会文化探索缺失的背景，并且有工业社会的消费和生产力，弥补了两者优点，这也是为什么中日韩在转型期都有大量的新兴文化或代表者诞生。</p>

<p>更简单的来说，文化发展是依托于新出生人口对世界的一种认知。</p>

<p>老年人口对世界的认知是已经固定的，基本不会再衍生出什么新东西，除非有生产力爆炸。</p>

<p>工业化社会的老龄化与少子化是不可逆的出现，中共下台后取消掉他们的错误政策，的确会带来创作上的自由以及一定的人口增长，但能到什么程度，会不会跟预期一样，到达日本以一个多亿人口在战后创造的全球影响力，我虽然大体是很乐观的，但不能不也从悲观的顾虑去思考。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.5</strong> —–2023-01-24 23:34:26+08:00:</p>

<p>我觉得你没搞明白我要表述什么，这不是单纯艺术史或者美学上的如何如何这种议题，而是文化上人们创造新事物的能力在显著有区别于过去，这种问题出现的根本原因与背后逻辑，这是我不担心有BUG，可以随便说，完全能通过举例表述出来的一个情况。</p>

<p>因为客观事实就是没有任何理由，一个文化产业的巅峰凑巧出现了大量足以青史留名的创作者与作品，每一次生产力进步带来的产业改革或革命式增长，有充足人口的前提下都会出现大量的人才，并非偶然。</p>

<p>也跟古代人和现代人的资质区别无关，跟单纯的字面意义的人口数量也无关，跟有钱有闲的人创作的著名艺术品也无关。</p>

<p>到时牛顿爱因斯坦的出现揭露本质，能刚好让你理解我到底在说什么。</p>

<p>爱因斯坦或者牛顿式的科学家出现是必然的，因为科学研究有了长期累积，他们的横空出世将经验转化为贡献，可能把这个进度推进了数十年更早出现，在以我们出生那一刻为坐标的认知观里，他们就是天降伟人。</p>

<p>也就是说技术、文化的繁盛发展，完全可以证明是离不开阶段性的累积与拓展创造。</p>

<p>并不是不喜欢或不了解现在的东西，而是能通过一些客观变化来证明事物确实存在变差的情况。</p>

<p>最简单的例子，星球大战系列，新三部曲技术上的进步是有目共睹的，但是为什么大众公认越拍越烂，甚至连星球大战原本的味道都丢了，比如说经典的模型道具。</p>

<p>如果我举例这些客观现象，然后单纯归结于是我不了解或者我不喜欢，那么就变成单方面认为是我个人的主观问题，而不是客观上确实存在的现象。</p>

<p>成了否定这种现象客观存在本身了。</p>

<p>就好比你自己说出来的邓丽君的唱法，如果她现在不会受欢迎，就无法解释为什么那么多人在各类音乐平台下循环，显然这群人都是现代的年轻人，不泛00后与90后，他们大部分甚至都是在邓丽君死后才出生。</p>

<p>那什么决定了他们在邓丽君死后又成为邓丽君的粉丝？然后转头说华语乐坛如何如何，说明好坏大家能分出来，客观现象是存在的，这不是一种叶公好龙，因为音乐是确实听到了人们的耳朵里，人们根据好与坏去给出评价。</p>

<p>四大名著更是明确，口碑显著，因为对比参照物都太差了，这些老电视剧不是完美的，如果你深究会发现拍摄技法也有出问题的地方，可是作为剧作本身，为什么连选角都做不好了，就像很多人吐槽现在的小鲜肉，那个谁，汪海林吐槽来着，说小鲜肉连台词都背不好，成龙也说过。</p>

<p>你看现在成龙那个年代香港动作的技术就开始逐渐流失，更多是人员流失，就很难再有人做到了，这个是成家班自己都公开承认的，过去没有CGI技术时，对实景拍摄的要求很高，全世界范围内的著名导演对现场的调度能力要求都很高，这种操控大量人员实拍能力和对自然光、灯光的把控理解能力，现在导演并不多兼具。</p>

<p>这些东西还没古老到因为时代原因才被尊崇，而是因为这些东西就是货真价实的好，你去B站看就知道了，人们是直面感受这些作品年代的一切好与坏，并不是叶公好龙听说了几句话就有个滤镜去称赞。</p>

<p>人们能区别好坏之余，判断出哪些是时代带来的技术差距，而不以此作为一个好坏的判断，所以无论时代先后，卓别林的电影和猫和老鼠也依然优秀，现在的小时代不能被主流接受还是不能被接受，即便确实会有人喜欢这东西。</p>

<p>而是真真切切有大量的年轻人先接触新三国这样的作品，然后发现还有老三国，跟着马上就出现对比，人们反而感叹的是老三国这样的作品很难再有了。</p>

<p>这是纯粹的新观众去看老三国，没有任何时代滤镜，拍的不好的地方也会说出来，但瑕不掩瑜。</p>

<p>好就是好，不好就是不好。</p>

<p>姜文的让子弹飞和一步之遥就是最经典的反差例子，人民群众是有感受的，不好的东西就不给你面子，没有那些所谓因为是姜文我就必须给好评的逻辑，</p>

<p>像陈凯歌，那就是靠霸王别姬、刺秦这些早年作品立的地位，假设单纯看后续作品的新一代，没了解过去进行对比，那陈凯歌会是什么样其实从作品口碑来看一目了然。</p>

<p>这些人拍不出当年的水平一直是国内热烈讨论的客观现象，不是说崇古滤镜。很多国产电影，除了港澳台那些老经典外，我看的都是两千年后拍摄的，小时候对老电影就不怎么感兴趣。我成年以后先看的新三国和其余的四大名著翻拍。</p>

<p>所以后续我看老三国时是非常震撼的，类似的震撼感还包括看霸王别姬，原来我们国人早就拍出这么好的东西。</p>

<p>大部分人是可以区分什么是好与坏，什么是自己不喜欢不感兴趣。</p>

<p>反过来，应该解释一下，为什么偏偏那么多人在同一个时代冒头，而过去这么多年，没有类似的情况出现，很多人出生和成长在这样一个没有老一代光环的背景下，相反现代的一些人应该是他们的启蒙者才对，但接触过后老一代的光辉反而更盛。</p>

<p>他们都齐聚在同一个时代出现，是偶然吗？显然不是，因为我们可以从时代和社会的变化构成去理解这种现象。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.6</strong> —–2023-01-25 00:14:34+08:00:</p>

<p>这里不是在谈人口本身字面的多寡，而是谈人口的年龄构成对文化产生的影响。</p>

<p>所以黑死病带来了人口总体的衰减，反而提高了人口构成里年轻人的比例，恰好是应对年轻人口数量对文化创造的影响。</p>

<p>日本的文化产业繁盛期是早些年经济发展的时期，虽然现在也是在持续发展的，当时日本还没进入高度老龄化社会，我们很多耳熟能详的东西都是诞生于那个时期，而不是后来的日本。</p>

<p>包括港台都是如此，在一个时期经济繁盛的同时，文化产业也迅速得以扩张，你要说经济水平，肯定是现在比过去好，但是那种超快速发展的势头却没有了，包括日本也是一样的状况。</p>

<p>新生人口与开放的创作环境都重要，香港电影产业在正式回归前已经开始没落，九十年代中后期逐渐下滑，这种下滑趋势不单独在香港出现。</p>

<p>跟新生儿出生数目也无关，因为你无论出生多寡，对应的都是本国人口。</p>

<p>日本的生育率就可以看出来端倪，当代文化产业的主要构成，都是来自于少数战前，部分战争当中与战后两次婴儿潮，有少部分来自于八十年代到九十年代早期，九十年代中后期开始彻底下滑。</p>

<p>韩国跟中国也都是在战后婴儿潮，持续到七十年代上下，八十年代开始稳定下滑，韩国文化产业这批人的贡献得益于无约束。</p>

<p>随着经济从05年后进一步高速增长迈向发达国家，开始在全球范围内发光发热，而且他们在八十年代到九十年代还保持1.0以上的生育率，给后续产业发展提供了一定供血，否则女团男团这样的缺乏基数更难搞起来。</p>

<p>我们的情况类似，第一波文化产业热潮出现在GDP翻十倍的过程里，婴儿潮的扛把子进入产业，带来了大量的创作，但之后经济进一步发展，却没有类似韩国的第二春。</p>

<p>当然这个我们都知道是国内限制的问题，可人口年龄构成的问题，从香港和日本的例子来看，也说明不能单独依靠市场的解禁去发展，需要两者兼得，就跟对外市场接驳开始变成世界工厂一样，苏联和印度同期都做改革，他们没改好缺乏条件，我们改革好了，才能对接这种需求。</p>

<p>现在问题就是，当文化产业的创作完全解禁，大概率是在二十年后，因为中共财政摆在那，他不倒你没办法，哪怕假设十五年财政出问题，五年时间崩溃到新政府充足恢复社会秩序。</p>

<p>整整一代人，年纪最大的零零后到时候都43岁，未来几年更替水平就要跌穿1.0，未富先老，22年出生956万人，按趋势十年大概率凑不出1亿人口，这种对内的短缺性是显而易见的。</p>

<p>我要考虑的是一个我们这代人接盘中共烂摊子后，要面对的切实问题和逻辑。</p>

<p>我不乐观的地方在于不是什么事都是船到桥头自然直，像想的那么简单中共下台一切都会好起来，那些没有中共限制的地方是有先例告诉我们的，如果不去意识到和学习经验避免，问题才会更严重。</p>

<p>我乐观的地方在于人少有人少的办法，中国不可能永远都不发展，可能下个世纪或者下下个世纪还有第二春，没准本世界中叶就生产力爆炸了，人口的总体减少大致是好的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.7</strong> —–2023-01-25 01:40:53+08:00:</p>

<p>文化作品来自于人，这些一切的依托基本单位都是人类个体。</p>

<p>一个人年纪到一定程度后，价值观取向与行为模式会固化，创作能力会下滑。</p>

<p>社会缺乏足够新鲜血液，不能在原有的发展基础上拓展文化创作的可能性，无论是文化本身还是文化作品，都将处于一种停滞状态。</p>

<p>就像文化偏好与个人爱好一样，不可能停留在老头老太太们喜欢的范畴，我们这一代人目前喜欢玩的梗与爱好如果在五十年后还是社会主流，那是很恐怖的一件事，这个社会五十年没变化。</p>

<p>一些传统文化能保存下来，在社会形态改变时，很多时候依靠的是年轻人对老文化的解构与再演绎，这时候世纪变成了一种新文化，比如说瑞克摇、王司徒鬼畜。</p>

<p>年轻人才有可塑性，能够适应新型态的产业、社会与生产结构，一个中老年人是基本塑造完成的，好莱坞是持续在人口有一定基础的前提下繁盛着，哪怕美国在大萧条时代前后，人口出生率也从来没低于2。</p>

<p>整个1880到1890年大体都处于4以上，大萧条开始前基本在3-3.5，有充足新鲜血液。</p>

<p>这就是为什么我表述农业社会成分更多的国家，在工业化完全展开前，他们保留的农业社会逻辑，会让人口出生率足够高来供给社会的持续发展，直到触碰到工业社会的完整形态后生育率开始下降，然后出现不足以为继的问题。</p>

<p>战后婴儿潮跟十九世纪中后期的生育率是大体一致水平的，这些国家按现在的逻辑是持续高增长了很长时间才逐渐进入低生育的工业社会。</p>

<p>而我们则是因为前三十年的问题，导致战前的人口增长被浪费掉，改革开放依赖的反而是战后婴儿潮，到八十年代开始可用年轻血液就越来越少了。</p>

<p>事实上就是美日这些国家在完全工业化前，人口出生率从来没低过，日本的出生率常年保持在4-5，战前最低的一次还是1875年到1880年，但也没低于3.5，但1975年以后正式跌破2开始逐渐下滑，团块世代与其子女、父辈，实际上成为了日本现代文明的主要构成，大部分现代日本文化都诞生自这几类群体。</p>

<p>通常的社会变革本身并不会增加新的人口，只是让出了生态位，而农业社会人口是基本劳动力，所以这种农业社会习惯残留的国家，出生率能快速填补人口缺失带来的缺口，从而出现大量新鲜血液，即便没有缺口也会有很多人生育。</p>

<p>但工业国家已经没有这种社会环境了，我们面临的是人口生育率未来下跌到0.75以下，跟美日在农业社会习惯残留时最低谷都都至少在2-3.5的比例不可同日而语，这就是为什么说中国跑步进入老龄化，日本1975年的2.0生育率，相当于中国现在，但中国这个时候已经不足1.3了。</p>

<p>同期日本则还有之前三四十年2.5以上的高增长，我国则是压缩到了一起，80-95后还能有2-3的增长，95后的数字则彻底垮了，我们劳动力储备对比其他国家过去经历的结构很不乐观。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.8</strong> —–2023-01-25 02:26:44+08:00:</p>

<p>所以我总感觉你没明白我在表述什么。就像我问你有没有一个完全是老年人主导 创造流行文化的社会一样，这个质疑其实已经把一切都回答了。</p>

<p>这不是对作品的我个人主观感受，也不是我看得少听得少，而是在我了解足够多的范畴和领域后，有足够多的人在同一种事情上表达出了趋同看法。</p>

<p>那就说明不是主观问题，而是客观存在的现象。</p>

<p>所以我压根不担心有BUG也不怕挑，不是我一个人说，包括汪海林这样的从业者也在吐槽，成龙也在吐槽，那就说明这是从影视行业内都能自我察觉的一个事实。</p>

<p>没有什么田忌赛马，新老三国时代差距才多少年？30年都不到，拍的都是三国，一个国家拍的，就算其中一部是例外，那何来四大名著全都是出现了类似问题，这就反应不是个例，哪匹马都是下马，那不是田忌赛马了，而是优劣确凿。</p>

<p>就像某些现代文化的诞生，为什么不能是早几十年，或者晚几十年，偏偏是在某个刚起飞的时期，经济发展与人口结构最年轻时才频繁出现杰出人才与作品。</p>

<p>难道是巧合吗？不是。</p>

<p>如果只是持续性的出现这种情况，而凑巧我注意到了某个时期，那民国或者当代社会在这方面的成就，整体应该更盛。</p>

<p>你没有区分开，什么叫做分辨好与不好，以及不了解不会去不喜欢这些判定的差异。</p>

<p>忽略观察大众反馈的意见，以及一些作品系列前后出问题，甚至同一个人拍都会变差这种事实。</p>

<p>如果一个东西广泛到足够好，实际上就会得到大众的认可，而不需要我去说它好才是好，因为作品的好已经是共识了，这是任何人在主流文娱作品上都无法脱离人民群众的一个事实。</p>

<p>用一个最抽象的数字比喻，人口年龄结构更年轻的时代伴随经济发展，同时期有100个有口皆碑的明星和50部作品诞生。</p>

<p>但是到了人口年龄结构开始老化的年代，同时期就只有30个有口皆碑的明显与15部作品诞生。</p>

<p>根本不是说只有过去的是好的，所以我没了解现在的是我崇古，我没了解的根本就不知道好坏，怎么去评价。</p>

<p>那么这个情况放大到社会也一样，大众如果认为有足够好的，那早就挑到话题上讨论了，比如流浪地球，流浪地球那就是好，没什么好说的。</p>

<p>问题在于，为什么偏偏人口年龄结构更年轻的时代，在全球各国社会演化到这个阶段时，都出现了趋同性？</p>

<p>而为什么后续的停滞、退化成人口年龄结构更老的时期后，也有趋同性？</p>

<p>我给出的解释就很简单，人口年龄结构更年轻，因为年轻人的创造力与可塑性更强，这是老年人口所不能比拟的，许多我们熟悉的创作者与演艺人员，都是很年轻就已经崭露头角，甚至有了代表作。</p>

<p>同样的，更多年轻人口意味着有更大的新生人口基数，意味着更多的可能性。</p>

<p>一个未来潜在的大师，只能从婴儿和孩子里诞生，而不怎么可能从一个六十五岁以上的老人中诞生，四十五岁大概率也不行。</p>

<p>因为现实有两个基本元素，第一只有老人的社会是无法创新的，第二饭吃不饱是没心情搞创造与娱乐的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>把握不住生产力进步同步文化繁荣，就永远失去了这个时机。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>创造新文化的只能是新一代的年轻人口，老年人大多只能使用他们已经被创造出来的，他们有自己的舒适区，所以老年人死亡，年轻人创造新事物，文化得以不断拓展向前，哪怕对传统文化的再演绎，也只是基于传统文化之上的衍生新产物，瑞克摇就是一个典型。</p>

<p>八十岁的老头老太们是不会组成互联网然后成为网络社区的主要构成，跟着去架构互联网文化并且催生各类模因的。</p>

<p>而工业社会的人口老龄化、少子化一旦开始，目前来看就是永久不可逆，不可逆的后果就是日本黄金时代后的当下，而我们还比他们的生育率要糟糕许多。</p>

<p>人是一切行为与因果的根本，脱离人的行为模式去谈文化繁荣是本末倒置。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.9</strong> —–2023-01-25 02:36:48+08:00:</p>

<p>我大部分篇幅都要花时间让人明白我在说什么，要举很多例子就很浪费时间，篇幅过长。</p>

<p>我的基本观点很简单，人口的年龄构成决定了一个社会创造文化的能力与可能性。</p>

<p>工业社会的老龄化、少子化一旦开始，人类社会目前没有任何先例是可逆的，这是关键前提。</p>

<p>并且每个在全球文化里留下影响力的发达国家，都是依赖于人口年龄结构更年轻时产生的文化概念去融入和影响其他人类社会，因为事后他们都进入不可逆的下跌周期。</p>

<p>因此在这种不可逆的演化趋势下，我们这样人口年龄构成全球堪称倒数的国家，还没发展出同期日韩在全球的文化影响力，没有对应的发展却有更严重的老龄化，这是十分危险的。</p>

<p>就这么简单。</p>

<p>你应该问一下我，社会对文化的创造力和表达力，来自于哪里以及哪个年龄层的人口，这就首尾呼应了。</p>

<p>我目前没看到过有任何一个文明或社会，是完全靠老年人制造国内或全球范围流行文化的，要是有可以告诉我，帮我debug，否则这个结论是逻辑自洽的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.10</strong> —–2023-01-25 03:09:01+08:00:</p>

<p>为什么我说你没看懂我在说什么？</p>

<p>我都说这么多次了，工业化的前提，才是人口有足够生产力去兼容大量年轻人口与资源，进而产生出文化的爆发式增长。</p>

<p>工业化你知道的吧。</p>

<p>你古代光是人多，没有用，生产力有限，产业有限，折腾不出天来。（但硬说的话也是有的，唐代的三国说话形式，到宋代的民间商业上与民俗上的编纂盛行，拓展到元曲形式流传，最后逐渐在明朝成书三国演义，但这种变化是很微小的，不是农业社会到工业社会的巨大跨度，没脱离农业社会）</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>甚至你这个论证非常粉红，因为你在证明中国这个大体量国家，共产党再怎么糟践文化产业，只要没完全掐死，一样能提供足够多优秀的文化产品供国人和外人享用，你一年能读50本书100部电影1000首歌，都是你国精品，难道年轻人口翻十倍，你的阅读量也能翻十倍不成？人的需求是有限的</p>
</blockquote>

<p>而且你这种论调我都不知道你到底在看的是什么，真的是在看我说的话吗？</p>

<p>两个人回复我，一个人说我是在证明无论怎么糟践文化产业，只要没完全掐死，就能提提供足够优秀文化。</p>

<p>另一个人跟我说我太悲观，只要中共下台解绑政策，一切就会好起来。</p>

<p>喜欢二次元文化的人，也可能喜欢韩流，也喜欢欧美文化，或者三个只喜欢其中一个，只要某种文化的接受度到了一定程度，自然有人接受。</p>

<p>人的需求是无限的，人的时间是有限的，所以才会选择，才会有不同的文化群体，有人喜欢看战狼，有人喜欢看漫威，依然喜欢看DC，有的人就是喜欢看动漫，这是跨语言和出身地的，不能默认每个人都学习完全相等的东西吧。</p>

<p>我很好奇你到底有没有理解我在说什么。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.11</strong> —–2023-01-25 03:14:51+08:00:</p>

<p>这个莫名其妙，不明白想表述什么。</p>

<p>年轻人创造的新文化，在全球范围内有影响力，老年人不一定感兴趣，不代表老年人没有自己的文化所属与偏好啊，你莫名其妙蒸发他们干什么？</p>

<p>打比方，年轻人写网文，如果成为国外流行文化，那也不妨碍国内中老年人下象棋和广场舞、听京剧。</p>

<p>但老年人这个群体不会是网文的主要创作者，这个形式也不来自于他们。</p>

<p>如果年轻人足够多且有影响力，重新解构广场舞和象棋、京剧去推广到全球，它跟老年人的也不犯冲突，但创造者仍然是年轻一代。</p>

<p>象棋和广场舞、京剧不会自己变成全球流行文化。</p>

<p>就跟日本动漫里以将棋为题材，或者游戏以黑道为题材，这都是解构后再演绎，这些东西不可能是不会画画的老头，代码不会敲的老极道（没小拇指还真就不好敲）为主去创造出来。</p>

<p>那么谁能掌握和有学习能力去利用这些技能，创造新兴事物呢？</p>

<p>就是要有持续不断增长的年轻人口，才能在生产力快速增长时保证文化繁盛，社会是不断进步的。</p>

<p>这是不断扩大全球文化池的上限，而不是这个文化池的总量有限。</p>

<p>（再谈一个有意思的现象，我认识一个老人，年轻时接触的都是文革或者很古早农村的东西，但现在这些早就绝迹了，农村也早就翻天覆地，而她排斥文革以后诞生的一切新兴娱乐事物，但她想要的那种文化娱乐，要么战后就消失了，要么改开就没了。那你说让她拥抱新文化，跟上时代的难度大，还是社会停止创造新文化，留在特定时期难度大？）</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.12</strong> —–2023-01-25 03:40:27+08:00:</p>

<p>因为你都没理解农业社会与工业社会的区别，让我怎么讲下去？</p>

<p>为什么反复唠叨让你注意，结果你还是没把这个作为重要参考坐标，就让我很费解。</p>

<p>文化的创作形态也改变了，你说唐诗宋词，那就是古代吊打现代，近现代也有部分佳作，但归根结底是现代不流行，也没有古代那种社会层面的依托，没有兴盛的土壤了。</p>

<p>就是因为社会形态的改变，这种文化创作已经脱离单一形式，唐宋有电影吗？有录音机吗？这种工业社会与农业社会的巨大代差，完全不用我说。</p>

<p>哪怕三国演义和四大名著的电视剧，也只是基于原著的改编，也改掉了不符合现代人或者不适合现代节奏的一些内容。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.13</strong> —–2023-01-25 03:51:27+08:00:</p>

<p>每年新出生的人口里，没法估计到底谁会成为文娱产业的创作者，因为本身老龄化与少子化社会就严重缺乏劳动力。</p>

<p>如果其他缺口增加，而出生人口减少，可能进入文娱产业的人就更少了。</p>

<p>所以年轻人口比例在工业社会里只能作为判断的趋势，而不能量化到具体细节，更别提文化影响力的数字化。（当然，你要是为了方便理解这么讲给我，那是另外一回事了）</p>

<p>那么年轻人口就是越多，理论可能性越高，因为反之出生人口越少的，进入文娱的人肯定也越少的。</p>

<p>比方说，出生1000个，可能有10到100人进入文娱产业，也可能是5到50个。</p>

<p>但如果只出生100个，那大概率他们都不会进入文娱产业，其他基础产业肯定更缺劳动力，那这个文娱产业就是后继无人。</p>

<p>现实里很多类似例子，香港电影产业这样的现代化产业尚且如此，更别提叫苦连天的一些传统戏剧、文化产业了（尤其是一些手艺类型的文化产业，没人继承只能失传）</p>

<p>老三国这种过去流行的东西到现在仍然流行，已经把你整个话题从群众给出的事实基础上颠覆了，你说这个不懂那个不懂，人民群众喜闻乐见，怎么老三国就是比新三国受欢迎有认可呢？</p>

<p>而且我还不是拿农业社会不再使用的文化习惯，跟现代仍然流行的东西强行对比。</p>

<p>老三国距离现在才多少年而已，新四大名著都拍砸了，导演水平下滑从陈凯歌和张艺谋我也给你举例，你没继续谈下去。</p>

<p>何况那么多人做音乐，怎么邓丽君还在华语乐坛到现在都仍然有那么多的拥趸，是只有邓丽君一个人在华语乐坛吗？如果她真过时了，就不会还有那么多人喜欢听了。</p>

<p>老三国可是实打实的老作品，过时了吗？四大名著都很差，你能说出所以然来，大宅门同一个导演，这种导演自身也开始下滑的趋势，又是基于什么。</p>

<p>市场是会检验这些东西的，检验来检验去，大众发现文化发展的黄金时代却不在当下，同样的东西对比发现却普遍是不如从前，你用过时的说法就不符合现实情况。</p>

<p>这些东西以前就很流行，现在还是很流行，以前不流行的，现在也不流行。</p>

<p>做的差就是做的差，哪有什么环境的变化，三十年时间，一代人而已，怎么现代社会就落差大到唐诗宋词到电影的差距了，是不是这个意思，你亲口当我面确认一下。</p>

<p>唐诗宋词的文化基础是文言文，现代基础是白话文，一个纯农业社会和一个高度发达的工业社会，强行凑在一起，难道是你区分不出来这些东西有差异吗？当然不是，你肯定知道差异。</p>

<p>唐代数百年，唐诗却不是一直兴盛，南北宋数百年，宋词在其朝代内也是有一个巅峰到衰退的过程</p>

<p>那为什么这些东西都有一个在自己朝代内都会出现的巅峰，哪怕没有改朝换代，后续仍然有佳作，却仍然渐渐平复。因为马尔萨斯陷阱在起作用，社会上人均资源分配减少，开始陷入农业社会特有的动荡。</p>

<p>动荡结束后人口减少，新生人口增加，人均资源增加，文化上又以不同形式发展起来。</p>

<p>解释一下什么叫环境变了，环境变了什么，现代那么多人才都喜欢扎堆出现的原因何在。</p>

<p>说一下你讲话很奇怪的地方：</p>

<p>【 这里我可没让你算精确的，精确到3个数量级总可以吧，中国人口才9个数量级 】</p>

<p>我前面说，因为“ 每年新出生的人口里，没法估计到底谁会成为文娱产业的创作者 ”，所以不能量化。</p>

<p>那你老问我“总可以”的前提是基于什么，量化的标准和要求是你自己给的啊，应该跟具体哪个逻辑挂钩，能不能详细讲清楚。</p>

<p>因为我注意到你自己经常突然提出一个量化标准，然后希望我去回答，但我知道这是个没法量化的趋势现象，也告诉你了，你我都清楚，那我就很不理解你一直希望量化的目的是什么。</p>

<p>还有一些让我一头雾水的话：</p>

<p>【 你的bug是不算总量算增量，搁这明天中国50岁以上的人都蒸发了，中国文化就繁荣了 】</p>

<p>都完全不知道你在说什么，为什么莫名其妙要让50岁以上的人蒸发，你也没后续解释。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.18</strong> —–2023-01-25 05:32:14+08:00:</p>

<p>比如说前面你说环境变了，然后用唐诗宋词的例子来对比最近五十年文化产业黄金期，问题是唐诗宋词在古代也是有属于自己的黄金期然后衰落的。</p>

<p>它们在自己朝代里，也有一个跟现代文娱产业一样的黄金期，跟着慢慢无法复现。</p>

<p>并且这些都是在当时的年代就已经流行的东西，现代它们的体裁里该流行的还是流行，环境就是人，人是这些东西都的基本载体。</p>

<p>跟现代的区别在于，近代农业社会转型工业时，工业社会的花样太多了，可以拓展的领域太大了，远远超出古代。</p>

<p>它能利用的资源与人口数量、产业类型是古代无法比拟的，出现了一大批足以比肩古人青史留名的杰出人才，很多人如果按他们的天赋，那都是才情不逊古人。</p>

<p>但问题在于，工业化社会的人口下降是不可逆的，无法复制古代那种伴随人口大规模减少后再次快速生长的潮起潮落，二战后主要国家都开始了工业化。</p>

<p>这才是环境变化，要不然还能有什么环境变化，中国可以说中共限制，就近的日本和香港呢？这些都是非常浅显易懂的。</p>

<p>工业化意味着现代文化的诞生，跟农业社会的传统文化是有区别的。</p>

<p>基于工业化这一道路上产生的现代文道路上，有什么环境变化。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.19</strong> —–2023-01-25 15:23:45+08:00:</p>

<p>因为压根不是我在自说自话，你从一开始就不断的用根本不合理的说辞去在反问，但实际上你自己是没去给充足例证的，说实话我都把你阴阳怪气的地方算在一起也不够多去作为例证。</p>

<p>我能说的很多，举足够多的例子，人言言多必失，欢迎你挑BUG，但你说左一个不懂，右一个看太少，结果是我自己给你列的例子多过你主动提起能说的。</p>

<p>有好几个地方是非常明确你压根没明白我在说什么，你都没明白我在说什么，是我自说自话么？</p>

<p>甚至我现在完全可以把你这里说的不合逻辑，和根本没看我所描述内容的例子举例出来。</p>

<p>唐诗宋词跑满了一整个朝代，怎么现在一个形式在现代三十多年就结束了，改革开放中国压根没说唱，我拿来比什么了呢？过去有古风歌，现在也有复古的国风歌，我拿来比的情况下，你自己改成了说唱，说是不同艺术形式我强行拿来凑在一起。</p>

<p>重点是作品质量，而不是一个题材的内容，拍不出来是能力的下降，而不是题材问题，超级英雄电影在漫威之前已经开始式微了，漫威出来又重新刷出一片成绩。</p>

<p>那我问你，为什么同期的DC就是不行，明明漫威卖的好，但它就是吃不到红利？</p>

<p>甚至拍出来蝙蝠女这种内部审查都过不去的东西，</p>

<p>有没有题材的差异？就像过去拍寇准和乾隆，放现在也一样是不行，没有雍正王朝的人气，说白了电视剧质量才是关键，过去没烂片吗，也不是啊，八十年代九十年代拍摄的也很多，可是真正知名能延续下来的也不是全部。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>提起三国，我推荐你看下那个3D动画版的三国，某些篇章是超越老三国的，这是不是你斩钉截铁论断的一个bug呢</p>
</blockquote>

<p>不止3D版，拓展一下，包括国产动画版在内，你要说因为老三国年代早，手法有相对不成熟的地方，导致拍摄未能更符合现代观影，这是合理的，但说某些篇章超越老三国，未见大众群体有这种印象产生，即便3D版质量按国产来讲已经算不错。</p>

<p>3D动画姑且也算跟2D动画接近的表达形式，与真人剧集区分开。</p>

<p>东映的三国志为什么能成为标杆，跟老三国一样，也不是完美无瑕，但人文表达到了一定程度，这是3D和动画版有但做的不足够的地方。</p>

<p>如果真的能做到某些篇章超越老三国，都不用你说，观众口碑早就起来盖过老三国，这才是真正意义上的超越和淘汰，但没做到就谦虚点，真做到了观众挂在嘴里的就不是老三国了。</p>

<p>单独把3D三国作为独立的作品看是相比国产同类作品有可圈可点的地方，但硬要比就免了吧，除非是老三国没拍的地方，否则还是免了吧，古城相会那一段已经看得出来问题在哪了。</p>

<p>为什么说你根本就没看明白我的表述，举个现成的例子。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>按你说法现在的后宫戏不如甄嬛传，那原因当然就是这十年生育率下滑了，这种说法真的有除你之外的人接受过嘛</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这是我的说法么？</p>

<p>压根不是。</p>

<p>这十年生育率下降，关2011年的电视剧什么关系，2011到2023满打满算12年，12年生育率下降，那12年前出生的人，难道12岁就进入电视剧组工作起来了是吧。</p>

<p>所以从这点可以看到，你压根不看我说话，也没明白我在说什么。</p>

<p>就像前面我感到莫名其妙为什么你不提工业社会的影响一样，只是先有立场后有结论，本身就不是会用论据反驳，或者去看我在说什么。</p>

<p>要不然无法解释你这两点是怎么来的，哪怕我说的那么清晰了。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>如果还是告诉我，新三国不如老三国，所以新一代拍片的不如老一代，那我们的交流是没意义的，就这样了吧</p>
</blockquote>

<p>实际上这一点就是完全不利于你观点的说法，因为拍摄同一题材，不止是新三国电视剧不好，就算是其他三国或者四大名著的翻拍，无论形式是电视剧还是电影，都普遍不怎么样。</p>

<p>一线皇帝都没拍好，哪会有题材饱和呢？说白了包括抗日剧在内，就是拍摄和创作能力下滑。</p>

<p>真正走套路用套皮模板创作的，都是一些没能力才需要方便的人，跟写网文小说跟风的一样，一大堆古偶，本质就是没能力拍东西。</p>

<p>可都说套路套路，同样是套路固定的四大名著连用新时代技术达到老作品水平门槛的都寥寥无几，又不是写网文，套路不足就拍不出来，那要创新干什么。</p>

<p>成龙之前动作片是不是套路吃满了，怎么成龙和李小龙就拓展出新道路了。</p>

<p>这是偶然还是必然？</p>

<p>再者，我还问了很多次，不见正面回应的问题。</p>

<p>尤其是著名导演还没死呢，张艺谋的满江红刚上映，但他现在很难或者压根也无法再拍出英雄这样的电影了，而英雄上映时还被批商业化过浓。</p>

<p>中年人本身就是主要的劳动力人口，而没有被规划为老年，对比六十五岁就是年轻人。</p>

<p>即便能找到一些国内外文豪的经典作品是中年出来的，但也同样有反例，比如茶花女、狂人日记、钟楼怪人、战争与和平、太阳照常升起，二三十岁已有创作，这些创作者和中年创作出经典作品的人，都是学而思之，年纪大的人的学习能力下降反而没有更多阻碍他们，实际上体现的是他们这群人持续创作的开端。</p>

<p>年纪大仍然有产出，并不意味着只能年纪大才开始创作，年轻时毫无创作，年老突然拿出传世经典的人，在这个世界上始终是极少数。</p>

<p>动漫创作者实际则刚好相反，以漫画作者为例，鸟山明创作阿拉蕾是25岁，龙珠时是29岁，岸本齐史是25岁，尾田荣一郎是22岁，如果他按进入行业当助手开始算，则是19岁，久保带人19岁，三浦健太郎23岁，井上雄彦23岁，浦泽直树24岁。</p>

<p>如果看演艺人员，可能年龄更早，有一些甚至十几岁就出来，甚至是童星和世家，这里不多举例占篇幅了，尤其是吃年轻饭的这一圈子。</p>

<p>所以可以看出来，中年或之后仍然在坚持创作的，至少都在年轻时已经开始创作， 吉斯梦妲后穆夏成名，但离不开前面多年持续创作的累积风格，所以老年开始有经典作品更依赖年轻时的持续创作，只是把年轻时的累积总结。</p>

<p>但你一定要从一开始就在学习技术，你很难说六七十岁了开始从头跟年轻人一样学习，这就是为什么新生人口很重要。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>好莱坞黄金时期是大萧条开始持续到1960 年这期间其实是人口增长下降的时期二战诞生的婴儿潮再他们进入青年时正好黄金时期结束、按你的理论这就不合理。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这个我前面已经说完了，一个新生儿诞生到进入产业，起码要20年，一个20岁进入产业的人，可以工作至少40年。</p>

<p>战争前后好莱坞蓬勃发展，依赖的时十九世纪末到二十世纪初的持续性婴儿潮。</p>

<p>七十年代到两千年初代好莱坞发展依赖的是战后婴儿潮，从1940到1975年，两点回归生育率约2.0为结束。</p>

<p>而大萧条前二十年，包括大萧条时期在内，美国的出生率都不低，至少在2以上，大萧条前甚至在3.5到4，这里还没包括移民、偷渡进来填充劳动力缺口的年轻人口。</p>

<p>大萧条结束后，从二战开始，美国的生育率实际是在增长爬坡的，其实你只要看数据就明白我在说什么了，因为即便是大萧条导致的人口下滑，也有足够多的人维持好莱坞的生产，并且大萧条之前和之后都是生育高峰，很好帮助好莱坞过渡了这个时期。</p>

<p>战后婴儿潮相当于二十世纪初的人口高峰，低谷是1940年大萧条结束后二战开端时。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>中国也是一样，人口大爆炸时期并没有文化作品的泉涌，反而是一胎制的改革开放时期文化蓬勃发展，到习近平这儿结束。这也和你所谓的人口结构论冲突了。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>人口爆炸新生儿不可能生下来，立刻就去写书拍电影，这是个最基本应该明白的道理吧？</p>

<p>用当下人口生育率去解释当下影视产业发展，纯粹是刻舟求剑了，我一直用的是过去对未来的影响，现在对未来的影响。</p>

<p>你现在人口生育率高低，影响的是未来而不是当下。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>一个新生儿诞生到进入产业，起码要20年。</p>

<p>1940-50年代的人，60-70年代开始进入不同产业，可能还包括30年代的人，但社会一直没解放他们在文娱上的生产力，解放后就有很大突出贡献，并且还有后续六十年代的人做接棒。</p>

<p>1980以后生育率跌到谷底，跟改革开放中前期的繁荣有什么关系。</p>

<p>改革开放的1980-2000年初，顶梁柱是我国战后婴儿潮的那一代人，也即1949-1960，后续1960到1975年也有很高生育率，这批人又支撑影视产业发展到2000-2020，所以你可以看到荧幕上的主心骨还是他们。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>这也和你所谓的人口结构论冲突了。事实就是这么简单，需求和供给</p>
</blockquote>

<p>所以不是我冲突，而是你算同时期计算增长人口去对比同时期作品数量，你现在生育率低也是二十年后劳动力不足，不是现在立刻就没有。</p>

<p>因为有八十年代前的婴儿潮，所以八十年代改革开放解禁了，才有充足人力和供应人才进入产业。</p>

<p>其他老龄化国家，没有充足人力进入产业，导致技术退步是个已经有了的客观现象，哪怕国内也有，这不需要我说，日常观察难道都没看到吗？</p>

<p>没有管制，当然会蓬勃发展，但是蓬勃的程度是基于从业者劳动力的数量，你没有充足的人力，做原来的产业都会吃力，更别说分散人手去做其他新兴产业了。</p>

<p>比如假设说电影以前人手够，能一年500部，现在人手不够，200部就有难度了，同样是文娱创作产业，有的人不进电影产业，去了游戏产业，游戏产业再随着技术发展，分流出主机、PC、VR、手机，这么一分流，人手就不足够了。</p>

<p>文化作品不是地里长的自然冒出来，仍然需要人力去创作与执行。</p>

<p>可用从业劳动力减少，你的产出品规模必然下降。</p>

<p>更别提有限的劳动力，还有很多要去维持社会的基本运转，过去可能6-8亿劳动力，有一部分可以分出来给文娱产业。</p>

<p>现在可能就2-3亿劳动力，人们对消费品的需求更多，生产要求和需求更高，如果对应那就是需要7-9亿的劳动力。</p>

<p>但你国内只有2-3亿，怎么拆开满足基本的社会运作需求。国外的做法是外包，或者进口产品解决，文娱创作能在这种环境下分到多少劳动力，一目了然的事。</p>

<p>未来十年新增人口总数不超过1亿是大概率的事件，三十年有没有2.5亿都是个疑问，而人口寿命增长，就会出现4亿不到的年轻人，与6-10亿的老年人，不到4亿的人口除了承担多于自己的老年人需求，还要创造资源与加工，提供各类服务。</p>

<p>日本就是现成的活例子，他们面临劳动力不足后也不是没有好的文娱作品，但跟巅峰时代比是拉开了差距的。</p>

<p>其实我已经表达过了，不清晰我就单独说一下，日韩文化是能通过发达的经济、文化影响力，创造了现代文化的延伸，是并入世界潮流一部分的重要标志。</p>

<p>年轻人是创造现代文化的主流，是探索未来边界的主要群体，也是社会的新鲜血液。</p>

<p>通过日韩的人口解构，我们可以看到创造他们能在全球范围内流行文化的群体，都是来自于从业者众多，有一定人口支撑的时期。</p>

<p>将流行的文化元素拓展，然后伴随经济发达带来的文化繁荣，成为了吸引全球的文化现象。</p>

<p>在我看来这个是不言自明的基本事项，经济发达伴随文化繁荣，就自然而然传播了，所以我聚焦的是为什么能文化繁荣，以及为什么我们经济发达了，却没有出现与之对应的文化繁荣和全球流行。</p>

<p>官方管制是自不用说的，但不意味着什么都是船到桥头自然直，因为日本的老龄化例子证明文化繁荣是有期限的，能在期限里留下，才算稳固。</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>您的这个回答并没有正面回答u Zealluck的观点“文化和文化作品的区别”</p>

  <p>为什么“韩国文化和日本文化<strong>产品</strong>会比其他文化产品更流行”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>文化与文化产品本身是互为表里，一个人可能无法去日本生活，但可以通过日本的文化产品去了解日本文化。</p>

<p>文化产品即为文化的体现与载体，但如果你没有形成现代文化本身，也就无所表达。</p>

<p>日本的传统文化并不是社会的主导文化，相反流行的是日韩的现代文化，在这个基础上才带动了传统古文化的二次创造与活跃。</p>

<p>或者反过来说，某些情况又是通过了解到日本文化的活跃程度产生好奇心，而接纳了日本的文化产品（或文化产品变成了更易于接纳的形式）</p>

<p>工业社会只有现代文化的拓展以及对传统文化的衍生再创作，因为日韩社会主流都是现代文化。</p>

<p>经济的繁荣意味着代表先进性的可能，而经济繁荣带来的表达、文娱创作也自然出现了文化繁盛，并且体现在流行一点的地方，就是当一个国家制造大量产品、高质量产品本身去吸引人时，他们自用于社会内部的文化，就会自然体现在商业产品上。</p>

<p>这一点不止局限在特地创作的文化产品，也包括了工业产品。</p>

<p>也即是说，这是他们生活的一部分，它可以是相当多部分都足够好吸引人的，自然从产品到互为表里的文化本身都更容易流行</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>您在另一个回答里对于日本动画的理解，我十分不赞同。流行文化产品本来就是要用量来堆出质，放弃了量就放弃了商业市场，回到小圈子里圈地自萌是肯定不会流行到大众之间，更何况流行本身就意味着会有更多新手参入创作作品拉低平均值量。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>好的作品其实就是好作品，这是不分时代的。</p>

<p>你的从业人口基数减少，连走量都堆不出来，那就更别提从中挑选足够好的来代表时代了。</p>

<p>而人口基数决定的，除了产品数量，还有一个关键是基于数量可能出现的人才数字。</p>

<p>因为没道理那么多天才都凑齐出现在同一个年代是巧合，这种密集型出现的现象，在全球各地发达国家或者高速发展的国家都有类似现象，说明是有其背后原因的，肯定有逻辑可循的，这也是我要探讨他们现代文化繁盛的根源之一。</p>

<p>流行源自于接受信息的人的渠道，如果国家封闭不发达，能接触到的渠道自然更少，更别提互联网的普及。</p>

<p>更流行是信息产业更发达，不同国家的耦合交流更紧密。</p>

<p>为什么人才变少了，变少的原因是什么。</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>至于“动画产业作画上的倒退”，请问您的论点是什么？您说马戏的话主要是因为老一辈画马戏的人退休，新一辈没几个人继承，还有萝卜不再是版本答案了。但是您看看运用现代技术的动画，上个季度的灵能和新死神，去年的边缘行者和去年年初的voy@ger，再前一年的双城之战，动画产业的作画并没有倒退。它是画的不好看了，没水平了，还是什么其他方面呢？</p>
</blockquote>

<p>举一个最直观的例子。</p>

<p>迪士尼的2D动画水平，发展到一定程度后就下滑，然后经典时代成为绝唱。</p>

<p>类似例子也包括了猫和老鼠这样的经典时代作品。</p>

<p>单独对迪士尼来说，他们在星银岛的演出我认为已经是传统2D在拓展新思路上的最大努力，那种流畅度在后来的公主与青蛙上就无法复现，我不是一个从业人员，但是我也看得出作画开始不如之前，我记得有人统计过这些创作人员的后续，实际都是离职转行或者分流出去。</p>

<p>海贼王TV作为超长连载的动画，内容有相当复杂程度，宇田钢之介时代与后来的宮元宏彰就大为不同，宮元宏彰的叙事手法，具体细节都越来越差，但没想到宮元宏彰以后还有更糟糕的。</p>

<p>当然你要说有个别地方做的很棒，那是当然的，很少有东西是完全一塌糊涂或绝对完美的，但就作品本身的前后对比，偏离风格和创作上的缺失也显而易见。</p>

<p>因为技术只是形式，表达的内核到了基本创作的门槛后，是不会变的，这也是为什么TV1000话的OP剪辑与初代OP剪辑一对比就能看出来差距，用初代总导演的分镜叙事，哪怕作画不同也问题不大了，反而完全独立创作的新OP内容却十分糟糕。</p>

<p>类似的OP噩梦还包括火影后期，我忘了具体是哪一个，但那种众人齐舞的显然脱离原来苦大仇深的叙事，甚至不能作为合格作品，很多人应该印象深刻，对比之下“我的痛苦在你之上”，如果不考虑作品的严肃基调，我反而认为作画表达上是很不错的，但那个OP是分镜做的差，画的也差，定的风格更差，跟佩恩那一幕完全无法比拟，我不清楚伊达勇登给谁放的权限。</p>

<p>如果你说作画的话，整个业界肯定还是能凑出一群人来，做出很棒的作品。可是整体呢？</p>

<p>但即便如此，随着老一代退休，新人进入的减少，能达到或者掌握这些高水准技术的人也在慢慢消失，海贼王的作画就是一个超长篇幅动画演变的经典例子，现在色饱和、光污染与子供化的表达方式，这肯定不是进步。</p>

<p>所以你能看到，在3D动画上，好莱坞或者说全球范围内业界顶流的那些人才，他们仍然能创作出很棒的作品成为个例，但是更普遍的，是业界的集体下沉。</p>

<p>跟恐怖的是内核上的下降，比如说皮克斯，黄金时代每一部都是经典，奥斯卡三连冠的奇迹，有由Wall-E这样载入史册的作品，我作为一个皮克斯爱好者，在我看来，皮克斯早期作品即便技术没后来好，但叙事方法总是让我能感到惊喜。</p>

<p>人物的一举一动不是后来迪士尼或者好莱坞CG动画那种特有的一惊一乍表现，那些角色多数时候都会给我意外触动，而不是看个新奇，你一张嘴我就知道你有什么情绪表达，尤其是经典的A-B点，人物会超快速移动，可以用但是用多了，所有人都在用，就不好了。</p>

<p>因此当你经历过足够好的，然后再看皮克斯现在的作品，这种质量落差感是客观存在的，没有因为技术进步而弥补，甚至双城之战里我也能看到欧美3D动画里经常惯用的一些表情动作。</p>

<p>所以边缘行者，这种情绪上能给我满足的产物更为稀少，即便今石洋之自从天元突破后，作品的表达和分镜总是有一些非常出位的夸张手法，却不影响情绪内核的表。</p>

<p>就像我说的一样，不是现在没有好作品，而是这些作品的数量，一些可以作为对比的产物、企业和人，都是有明显的差异。过去不是没有烂作，也是一堆烂作品里有一些传世经典。</p>

<p>但现在的情况是，即便比烂，都很容易出现一个没比过的情况，而现在全球的文娱作品更多了，但是同样的经典却更少了。（比如说死神，死神新篇章篇幅小，尤其是有原著剧情分镜做支撑。但是死神TV本篇，也是出现了一开始到中期越来越好，越往后却越有问题的现象，只是还没长到海贼王与火影的程度就被腰斩了。）</p>

<p>就像这个时代再也没有剑风传奇这样的作品横空出世，也没有今敏、大友克洋这样的人，但反过来想，他们居然是同一时代的产物。（包括剑风传奇TV也是，第一部的TV片头片尾封神，说明导演水平在线，后面新TV出来，虽然看得出制作组在努力，但做不到的就是做不到，制作组摆烂跟用心没能力做到是可以区分的）</p>

<p>就跟谏山创虽然画工稀烂，但是跟福本伸行一样，基本功足够扎实，叙事分镜能清晰表达内容，光这一点已经摁着现代许多年轻漫画家脑袋暴打，很多二三线的作品基本分镜功底都过不去，甚至本子作者都比他们好，而本子作者的分镜基本功又有许多是不如老一代本子作者的（这群人很多是过去从事助手或者上过岸，叙事基本功非常扎实）</p>

<p>所以现在有藤本树这样一个人才就足够吸引目光了，好作品从来都是有的，但数量和密度，以及与普通作品的落差开始加大，这是肉眼可见的，JUMP自身的没落就是一个典型例子，台柱稀缺，鬼灭之刃的爆火更多来自于集英社的推动，硬说作品素质是无法跟前辈比的，作者鳄鱼本人也知道难以强行延长为其他类型的大长篇，包括英雄学院在内也是。</p>

<p>我一度很看好堀越耕平，因为逢魔时刻动物园我就在看了，但是英雄学院的质量与格局，确实是无法达到前辈们的水平，国内后来被炎上无关就不谈了。</p>

  <p>请问如何您是否，或者您坚持的话如何，使用您“社会转型和文化发展的关系”的推理来解释这日本动画的三十年，以及原问题为什么“韩国文化和日本文化<strong>产品</strong>会比其他文化产品更流行”。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>日本的文化传播在国内是因为经济上允许了，技术条件也成熟，有传播渠道，更早期是影视剧，比如追捕。</p>

<p>更早一些，其实在八十年代末到九十年代初，已经在国内传播，圣斗士星矢就是典型例子，龙珠当时还有盗印版，我不清楚我看到和收藏的是不是正版，在九十年代到两千年初，动画传播就非常常见了，不止是电视台借着中日蜜月期播。</p>

<p>也包括了后来时代更替后，著名的点播台形式。</p>

<p>而日本本身，其实可以看到，EVA播出后，意味着现代日本宅文化的逐渐形成，但不是EVA独立带来的，如果看过同人本子，会发现一些社团在八十年代末和九十年代已经开始活跃。</p>

<p>其中很多人都是六十年代和七十年代出生。</p>

<p>这里其实对应的就是日本六七十年代的最后的人口增长期，日本1975年后跌破2.0。</p>

<p>这个时候农业人口的增长余力就逐渐停滞，但是因为人口延后的原理，所以六十年代到七十年代出生的人口，在二三十岁时，构成了现代日本宅文化的主要成分与来源。</p>

<p>他们是最年轻的一代，站在现代新兴文化的浪口上，而年纪稍微大一些的，数量充足还能供应在产业岗位上，就带来的产业的兴盛（包括同时期他们经济的发达）</p>

<p>而六七十年代出生的人口，他们构成了第二波日本动漫产业的发展热潮，也即是九十年代到两千年。</p>

<p>那么日本漫画产业在80-00年代的现代化爆发，从50-70年代国内为主拓展到全球范围，出现大多世界级的人才与大师，是不是一个偶然？</p>

<p>这里用漫画产业来做一个方便理解的例子，最著名的佼佼者就是JUMP三巨头，早一些出生的包括小畑健、讲谈社的牛姨，他们都是同时期生人，差距都很小，包括井上雄彦、富坚，连三浦、原哲夫、荒木这样的都是。</p>

<p>可以看到，有一个完整的人才供应梯队，从手冢、水木茂、藤本F不二雄（包括A）往后，日本漫画是有很多充足的人力梯队供应。</p>

<p>而这个人力梯队，恰巧对应的是日本的人口增长。</p>

<p>伴随人口增长下滑，到八九十年代还有一些生育率在1.5以上的表现，所以出了一些我们现在也知道的漫画家，可是数量明显是大幅度下滑了。</p>

<p>确实影响到了产业发展，JUMP每年都有无数人投稿，但是能在JUMP那过审，并且被推荐去做助手的人就少之又少，对比八十到到九十年代是完全无法比的，业内有丰富经验的助手成了抢手货，更别提门槛都达不到被刷下来的。</p>

<p>如果助手减少，能达到九十年代合格水平的人都不如过去，漫画家作为从助手转正的一种工作，在编辑部降低标准放水的情况下，都无法稳定有人才和佳作出现，就已经反应人口变化对产业的影响。</p>

<p>经济的繁荣更促进内生现代文化的诞生，以及商业消费品的流动。</p>

<p>而日本通过战后几代人在文化产业上的创造，已经形成了一个新的现代文化分类，是非常主要的亚文化群体，已经谈不上是小圈子了，这才能让他们的文化如此流行。</p>

<p>那我们现在面临一个没到日本累积数代人创造出新的现代文化的繁荣程度，经济与人口结构都开始出现问题，这是我更多提出这方面忧虑的原因。</p>

<p>观众口碑可以不错，但是为什么无法取代老三国成为三国话题本身的主心骨，变成脍炙人口的一部分？（第一部分的评价要是去翻看，会发现两极化的口碑不一）</p>

<p>我自己看过我也是知道的，挺多地方对比国内这个环境是可以了，但如果你让我说我以老三国为对比，我是不会给极高这种评价的。</p>

<p>最典型的就是古城相会，张飞和关羽的互动，如果没有老三国珠玉在前，你这个是可以的，即便是不考虑这点也是能用的，但对比后可以发现，剧组怎么可以用关羽拿刀这种暗示去诠释矛盾，老三国两人释怀是没有任何包袱的。</p>

<p>同类的还包括红楼梦，红楼梦当年也也其他人拍，就王扶林的成经典，这不是偶然，否则当年赵丽蓉版本的红楼梦也该是经典了</p>

<p>赵丽蓉的刘姥姥单看也不错，但是跟王导版本的沙玉华比，是可以感受出差距的。</p>

<p>这跟宣发无关，就以王扶林的两个作品为标准，你看下花絮，鲍国安念台词的功力，就比3D还是其他任何版本的配音演员都要好，红楼梦剧组演员，私下采访的那个范，现在演员根本没有，台词都是演员自己配的。</p>

<p>怎么就那么奇怪呢？不谈姜文、张艺谋、陈凯歌、徐克、周星驰、成龙这些人扎堆出现在同一个年代这个神奇现象。</p>

<p>就单独谈两个电视剧，一个导演，却诞生了那么多经典形象，怎么选到那么合适的人，然后凑巧这个人还演的那么好，台词水平那么高。</p>

<p>说明中国影视业商业发达程度是在当下，但是水平高度确是在八九十年代人才储备充足，自由化的社会氛围仍然相对浓厚的时期。</p>

<p>现在张艺谋也喜欢全国海选，很多导演都是全国选人，最后都选的是什么，不言而喻。</p>

<p>好的东西就是好，不会有崇古滤镜，何况这才几十年而已。</p>

<p>我第一次看黑泽明电影，就是非常震撼，原本以为是早年电影发迹早，所以有口碑是因为年代带来的影响力，然后从开始看到结束，一眨眼就过去了，全程没尿点。（所以我反思，这是我过去鉴赏能力不足带来的傲慢。）</p>

<p>拍摄技巧与手法惊为天人，叙事手法和内核表达拿出来都是极为先进的，老三国对我来说也是一样，我是很晚才开始看这部电视剧，前面说了我是先看新三国，过去对三国的印象也只是停留在小人书和口耳相传的一些故事，但我看了以后不会因为年代感而觉得它过时和不好，相反表达手法与情绪是超出我预料的。</p>

<p>这一点在东映三国志里也有，但是在3D三国演义就没有，也不能说他们不好，而是他们的技艺成熟度和表达的手法确实没达到超过我这个观众预期的高度，没有走到我前面，斗气一样的战斗我反而不拿来作为不好的理由，但很多人却拿来说。</p>

<p>在国内这种环境下，做到这个程度已经算不易了，这是他们好的前提，但还没到前无古人的程度，老三国是做到了，目前也是后无来者，完全没有我看之前以为的老套，情绪表达非常自然与充沛，但你让我挑，其实老三国分的几部里，也有一些导演没拍好，比如中后期，拍的比较枯燥，关羽走麦城前后我感觉就一般甚至不好，如果不是演员发挥好，恐怕更糟糕，整个情节很流水账。</p>

<p>创作的核心人员依赖人数，肯定潜在值越大，出人才的可能性越高。</p>

<p>而且就算不考虑人才，单纯考虑从业者，有的很多就是影视民工，即便是高技术的专业工种，那就是需要人力来凑的。</p>

<p>否则人力不足，这些施工团队的劳动成本和价格也会很高，这不能用计划经济角度去思考假设国家可以控制谁进入某个产业。</p>

<p>第一</p>

<p>你说一个国家专攻娱乐，其实这样做是没必要的，因为现实环境是反过来，有实际例子，一个企业全球化外包（分散成本）</p>

<p>比如说最经典的育碧罐头工厂，他们就是外包游戏业务到全球各地，而不是集中一个国家专攻娱乐然后分散其他产业靠进口。</p>

<p>而且劳动从业这个，你没法强行控制人口去娱乐产业，他的人没这个天赋和兴趣，也进不去这个产业，所以在合理的市场与教育环境下，肯定是新增人口基数越大，越容易出现进入该产业的劳动力与核心人才。</p>

<p>全球分工体系能带来效率提高，但也容易带来质量下滑问题，有的团队便宜不是没原因的。</p>

<p>第二</p>

<p>科技提升能带来个人与团队工作的提高，但你出售的是劳动时间而不是工作件数，一个公司可以因为技术提高的效率，从原来同时期三部作品，拓展到同时期五部作品。</p>

<p>变化的最终是市场的产品数量，因为企业总是在追求利益最大化，他首先考虑的不会是效率提高后可以给员工多少时间，只有环境不好时才会考虑裁员方式降低成本，而且也不影响核心人员的构成，因为这些人很重要。</p>

<p>而人口基数不足，出现这种核心创作人才的概率也更低。</p>

<p>第三</p>

<p>市场供需的前提时，有劳动力给你供应，现在情况是都没有新生儿作为劳动力供应了，怎么产生供需关系，其他国家有需求，我们本土的文化企业也供应不上，吃不到这笔买卖。</p>

<p>如果你没有核心创作人员，连外包的体系都建立不了，因为压根国内都没需求。</p>

<p>人是生产力的基本单位，出生率低到未来劳动力严重不足，我也没法控制特定人员进入文娱产业，也没法知道谁有潜力。</p>

<p>每个新出生的人口都跟开盲盒一样，那到底是人口基数越大得到对应结果的可能性越高，还是人口基数越少得到的对应结果越高，这一目了然。</p>

<p>新一代学院派比如斯皮尔伯格、科波拉、卢卡斯这些人就是在这个对美国当时来讲的谷底诞生，但这样的谷底对其他国家高度工业化的国家，比如日本在60-75年代的增长率是一样的，60-75年代的人口增长也延续了日本在九十年代到两千年的劳动力与人才涌现。（但仍然有下跌趋势。）</p>

<p>好莱坞则在后来转向了早期特效产业的崛起，尤其是模型道具，到八九十年代则是CG特效，这些产业发展都需要从业者涌入才能掌握新技术。</p>

<p>就像黄金时代缺乏特效手段，因此对现场调度与实景拍摄要求很高一样，随着后期特效技术的增加，这些技术到六十年代还在沙漠龙虎会这样的作品里可以看到，但是到了七八十年代的电影就逐渐减少，可是依然有。</p>

<p>一直到电脑特效盛行，这种实拍技术才慢慢变成少数，掌握的人大多数去世或者退休，从而变成了一个小众门类。</p>

<p>然后发展出一个诡异的现象，好莱坞对实拍和场面调度的能力下滑，因为太过依赖于后期，并且因为依赖电脑特效，导致好莱坞在七八十年代兴盛的模型道具技术，也出现了萎缩，跟实拍和现场调度一样，开始逐渐发生变化。</p>

<p>如果追求实拍和模型道具的质量，越往后的电影越难看到肯定的。</p>

<p>可有一点是，这些尽管随着技术发展变得小众，但是从来没完全消失。</p>

<p>什么决定了这些东西没有消失？不断涌入的从业者！在一些利用率较高的区域没有产生断代。</p>

<p>本身决定产业的，一个是环境（政策、市场等），一个是从业者数量（八九十年代的影响，大多出生在战后婴儿潮的十几年里，然后有一些中生代）</p>

<p>两者本来就不能缺乏，供需关系是人决定的，政策如果不是彻底堵死，只是让环境更公平，创作者没有原地消失，他们也可以转入电视产业。</p>

<p>电视技术的兴盛削弱的是电影院的话语权，垂直体制被破坏，也意味着大公司在电影院的话语权被改写，并不是不让拍摄，或者不让原来的从业者们活下去。</p>

<p>这些人没死就要继续工作，无论是什么形式都好，都会有产出。</p>

<p>这也是为什么你用好莱坞黄金时代举例是错误的。</p>

<p><strong>没有人，再好的政策也运转不起来</strong>，<strong>人的存在决定一切</strong>，<strong>包括所有市场供需关系与科技的利用，脱离人去谈政策和科技是本末倒置。</strong></p>

<p>我国改革开放后，如果没有充足新生代人口，文娱产业是绝对到不了当时的高度的。</p>

<p>香港没有制度问题，一样自然衰败了，日本也是同理，香港的生育率干脆是血崩，再也起不来了，美国的生育率经历大萧条与二战，再低也有兜底的，黄金时代的改制，不意味着没有人才供应了啊，无论香港还是好莱坞八九十年代的兴盛都是事实。</p>

<p>这不就是你否定忽略以人的存在为一切基本要素的最佳反例么。</p>

<p>我觉得每次我都要用大量时间去阐述对我来说默认不言自明的道理或逻辑，而对其他人却不知道，如果不说就一直是其他人的盲区，这对我而言非常浪费篇幅和时间，搞得我好像每次都想长篇大论一样，而且其他人还不一定仔细看，甚至不一定想去理解，这是最棘手的。</p>

  <p>跟你说不通，你的逻辑完全是混乱的。我说可以专门发展娱乐是为了反驳你必须每个行业都要人，娱乐人不够的理论，你给我举一个例子一个公司外包，觉得这个就能反证我提出的可以专精某个产业的说法了？ 是世界上没有一个国家大力投入某个行业的先例么？日本动漫韩国电竞偶像巴西足球这些例子数都数不过来。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>我不知道是你这方面逻辑想不通容易进入盲区，还是纯粹了解不足够。</p>

<p>政府推动某个产业发展，也不是在强迫人们从事这个产业。</p>

<p>这是一个最基本的常识，根本不需要说出口的事，你要非要让我特地把这个说给你看吗？你是真不懂这个情况，还是想不到。</p>

<p>政府只能基于现有人口数量诱导和鼓励，推动产业难道是从一群六十五岁以上老人里选择新星的吗？</p>

<p>连响应号召的入行年轻人都只有过去的十分之一甚至百分之一的时候，你怎么保证这些人里能每个都达到前辈的水平。</p>

<p>你说的这些产业，哪个不是需要依赖充足的年轻劳动？？？</p>

<p>只有年轻劳动力的基数足够大，市场或者政府的正确反应才能起作用。</p>

<p>香港电影政府从九十年代末到现在都在积极推动，怎么不见重新发展起来，日本也在做，都不见起色，为什么？因为缺乏年轻人入行。</p>

<p>产业又不是磨盘，你推它就一定有正面结果，文娱产业需要技巧、兴趣和能力，再民工也跟有手就行的工种不同。</p>

<p>人人都会踢足球，踢得好的少，踢得好的里出来几个梅西，三十个年轻孩子里出梅西的可能性更大，还是十个孩子里出梅西的可能性更大？</p>

<p>我就不明白哪里逻辑混乱了，基本数学题和常识还算不过来吗？</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>还有第二你根本就不能理解我说的话，你反复强调人口爆炸才能多产出文化作品，我跟你说的意思是人数少了但是科技上去了所以产能还是会提升，你又转进到人数多才能产生核心创作人才上去了。而且你这也是胡扯，人才是靠人数堆上去碰机率的么，那中国印度早就世界老大了。真是累就这样吧</p>
</blockquote>

<p>创作是主观的事，一个人代表一种观念和表达。</p>

<p>每个人都有独立的思想和价值观，他们的创造产物都是不同的，人口减少意味着这种更创作层面带来不同可能性的多样化的生态也随之减少，就跟物种多样性和基因多样性一样。</p>

<p>1000个人有1000个哈姆雷特，100个人，哪怕科技上去了，产能变成2000个账面哈姆雷特，创作的基础模板还是只来自于这100个人的哈姆雷特。</p>

<p>漫威产能提高了，但谷子还是那套东西，产能不代表质量和高度，但没有产能也不行。</p>

<p>这是为什么需要有核心人才的原因，而这样的人才是科技进步无法带来的。</p>

<p>那为什么同样需要产能呢？因为科技进步的效率再高，还没到你想象那种程度，一个人就可以包办全部，仍然需要专业团队。</p>

<p>尤其是技术越来越多，越来越细分的现在，核心创作人员代表创作的思维和风格更广泛，这也是为什么日本动漫从成人、搞笑、子供、少年到青年，各类题材都有，现在反而被人批趋同的原因。</p>

<p>核心创作人员是大脑，施工团队是手脚，技术进步可以减少手脚的工作量，但仍然需要充足的大脑去进行独有的表达，否则所有东西都会高度同质化，而手脚工作量减少，不意味着不需要。</p>

<p>人数基础是人才诞生的可能性来源，这种东西只能是越高越好。</p>

<p>中国确实一度就伴随经济腾飞与自由化，带来了触及世界顶端水平的文娱作品团队啊，八九十年代的文化兴盛是假的吗？然后伴随政府加紧管制，同时人力枯竭开始双方面的减少，这不刚好对应我说的么？</p>

<p>印度也完全在我说的范畴内啊，印度人口庞大，但经济发不发达，你也是知道的。</p>

<p>可是现在他们在崛起，那少部分经济发展的成果，就已经出来了宝莱坞和一些偏国际化的高质量演员与作品，这个不就是文化伴随经济增长体现出来的影响力么。</p>

<p>默认技术的增长会自动解决一切人力不足的问题显然是错误的，这只会导致企业追求更高的产能，现实当中网飞和漫威就是例子。</p>

<p>人口缺乏在创作层面的体现，不止是施工团队层面人力不足，也包括了创造型的”大脑“核心人才的整体减少。充足的潜在劳动力人口与发展起飞的经济，两者缺一不可。</p>

<p>你累了不愿意说就这样吧，我大部分篇幅都是在谈论据，实际核心观点已经表达过很多次了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.26</strong> —–2023-01-26 18:47:41+08:00:</p>

<p>三国的故事主体是刘关张曹操诸葛亮孙权这些主要角色和英杰们的交互，影视剧所谓改编，改的就是没必要凸显的细节，或者应该雕琢的细节，因此“改的好”也是个技术活。</p>

<p>很多东西不是越细越好，所以改编是基于创作有成本和限制的前提下，把立意通过内容最大化表达，让观众能感受情绪上的触动。</p>

<p>新三国和老三国这点上就是很好的例子，新三国省略过多，三结义到典韦这些都省略掉，3D版本也有类似问题，在内容表达上太过流水账，老三过却着重描写结义的前后，还特地借美人比喻武将写了一曲淯水吟，这是王扶林抓的最好的地方，情绪表达和爆发足够。</p>

<p>观众在追求的其实不一定是一个小细节扣的有多投入，而是作品整体在角色表达上的情绪爆发，这种情绪上的表达，在新三国里就几乎都是失败的，因为它的整体情绪没有放开。</p>

<p>比如说张松献图，其实是一个在原著里表达不是那么有爆发力的桥段，但是老三国通过对演员的选择，导戏对表情、台词和音乐的控制，把这一幕表现的情绪渲染力拉满。</p>

<p>3D版三国因为是3D的相对成本较低，并且打算拍很长，或者导演的个人水平问题，导致其实整体可以给原著剧情和拓展的细节更多，但是取法了这种情绪累积上的爆发，而新三国则是要细节没细节，要情绪爆发也没情绪爆发。</p>

<p>像这样被人非议以至于成梗，其实早有公论，但也不能说它没优点，最重要的是不能有对比，任何事就怕比较。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1994.27</strong> —–2023-01-26 23:16:07+08:00:</p>

<p>人口大规模损失只要不是集中在生育年龄一代，战后通常有婴儿潮，不过活力可能要等到战后多年才能体现出来，因为婴儿潮成长需要时间。</p>

<p>我觉得一个专业化的老年人，他的确是能活到老学到老，并且持续创作。</p>

<p>但是他的世界观是固定下来了，对世界的看法也不会有太大改编，因此尽管持续创作，却通常无法成为流行文化的前端。</p>

<p>一个非专业化的老年人，他通常也无法适应年轻人的流行文化，更别提在产业层面的可塑性。</p>

<p>年轻人比老年人可塑性更强是个生物学的问题，这是无解的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1995.1</strong> —–2023-01-25 19:15:52+08:00:</p>

<p>那不一定，这个帖子别人没告诉我，我是不知道的，后来看到了其实也懒得说，毕竟月经话题，但有人希望我过来回答做科普。</p>

<p>大部分时候我主动说这个话题，都是因为其他人错的太离谱才出来说科普而已。</p>

<p>前两年还好，科普了起码有人知道。</p>

<p>最近一年多，有很多新人涌入，又要重新搞科普。</p>

<p>大体分为两类，一类是肯学的，这还好。</p>

<p>一类是有既定观点的，单方面不知道从哪得出的结论。</p>

<p>其实赵紫阳文献和文集都出来这么多年了，不考虑毛周这样的焦点，算是中共领导层里对外透露信息量最大的一个人，大部分人还停留在不考证这点上。</p>

<p>很多时候就是中共在墙内完全封闭了对赵的事迹信息，只能从六四了解这个人，也不清楚八十年代中国政治生态他和胡耀邦在什么位置。</p>

<p>突然翻墙出来，就用有限的了解去评价，这是很多误读信息的来源。</p>

<p>赵紫阳的遗部为什么那么执着于推出文献和资料普及信息，就是因为赵的贡献之大远超想象，却在墙内被除忆式抹杀，因此希望以正试听，但确实没几个人会翻资料吸收理解。</p>

<p>很多人谈的都完全脱离当时环境，属于盲人摸象管中窥豹。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1995.2</strong> —–2023-01-25 20:33:30+08:00:</p>

<p>赵紫阳嫡系还有很多，基层的还没死绝，尤其是四川一系，中央的老干部里，田纪云这些人还活着，中央主政拉起来的嫡系里，杜润生一脉还有相当多人活跃在学术圈与民间（这些赵杜系的学术人员本身从立场和意识形态上与他们都是解禁的，也是他们一手扶持起来的，构成当代学术圈的重要组成，明面上活跃的比如周其仁。而现在不算赵的嫡系，甚至立场对立，但是出自这个圈子的如王岐山、温铁军）。</p>

<p>两任总理温家宝、朱镕基这些人也是赵的人，只不过一来保守派执政，他们个人地位太高不方便说话，二来赵紫阳已经不需要党内平反。（朱镕基提出过给赵的问题做研究，李岚清也同意，李瑞环、胡启立这些立场上也是赵这一面的，胡耀邦一脉的能量还是很大，所以后来条件允许平反了，但主要可能跟他儿子和习的关系有关）</p>

<p>习近平连任后的现状，就是中共拒绝赵紫阳路线，一脚踩死油门，这个局面不会改动了。</p>

<p>因为六四已经跟党内保守派行为和观念完全对立起来，现在是保守派踩油门开倒车，迟早是要下台的。</p>

<p>保守派做的越错，社会矛盾越大，越能凸显赵紫阳路线的存在感和正确性。</p>

<p>一旦社会矛盾大到出现第二次六四，赵紫阳就注定会被民间与政府的对立做对比。</p>

<p>社会动荡后，无论谁当政，都肯定不会是被赶下台的保守派，而社会需要回归到一个正确的发展路线上，这个路线就注定是赵紫阳路线。</p>

<p>因为社会只要经济持续发展，就必须走赵当年提出的路线，分权与提高劳动待遇，也是民众客观需要的。</p>

<p>党内、民间与学术圈站队和同情赵紫阳，除了个人情感因素，也很大程度是因为政治立场原因，赵的观念其实只是换了一个名字，国内打压所以无法套上去用，这些年的社会运动与学术争议，针对自由化的打击，其实很大程度都是对胡赵延绵不断的影响力做预防，比如打击和污名化公知。</p>

<p>但结果是官方必须自己重新面对来自基层的民族主义与激进情绪，然后去年就完全反噬了，合订本太多了，而官方也不能解决赵抛出的公平社会这个议题，那就是死局了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1995.3</strong> —–2023-01-25 22:25:22+08:00:</p>

<p>评价的话，觉得太多人说六四，说多了也腻。</p>

<p>说反瞒产又陷入毛左反改革开放，或者反贼无差别反中共，再到反自由化的保守派支持者这种立靶子打的无聊话术里，会忽略主次关系，毛批示转发要求跟进才是问题源头，赵彻底掉头就是对自身反瞒产的最大否定，杨继绳和杜导正这些肯定赵影响与贡献的人都不避谈就说明没什么好说的，这靶子立不起来。</p>

<p>所以应该说赵的经济影响，对现代人生活有什么影响，因为中国人都受益于经济发展。</p>

<p>四人帮倒台后，改革是党内共识，但是怎么改没有共识。</p>

<p>因此出现了三个路线：</p>

<p>1.华国锋希望在毛制基础上略改。</p>

<p>2.陈云希望回到建国早期的模式，执行鸟笼经济（政府控制，允许部分私营经济，把经济管起来）</p>

<p>3.邓小平希望走市场经济，对外开放。</p>

<p>三人的路线斗争，邓小平能胜出的主要原因，就是市场经济的实践路线，被赵紫阳从人民群众再到地方上一点点抓起来得以推广证实正确。（胡耀邦的影响贡献这里题外话不谈）</p>

<p>因为邓本身是不懂经济工作这些的，他只是有政治上的取向和偏好，实际负责的是赵紫阳从头开始做起，在地方上一点点吃螃蟹，毛时代末期冒生命危险去私下搞新制度。</p>

<p>包干到户有三个关键人物，万里、赵紫阳、周惠，万里是坚定派，人比较刚跟一些人关系不太好，赵紫阳自己支持包干到户，但人少不好办事，所以怂恿周惠，发挥一个不小的影响。</p>

<p>尤其是赵紫阳在四川时，当代的社会主义市场经济的说法（不考虑顾准的情况），就是在他庇护下于1979年召开的成都会议上提出，并且作为推广概念在民间和基层政府被确立起来的，后来也得到了邓的认可。</p>

<p>也就是说，改革开放的实践概念，最早是赵紫阳在毛泽东末期啃出来的，同时期的还有万里，这两个人把地方改革坐实了，邓小平在中央只会说的局面得以改变，让路线确立，赵紫阳万里不肯带头，邓小平在中央是无法做改革的。</p>

<p>所以邓小平说的摸石头过河，其实算是简化了，严格来说是摸刀片过河。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>当时社会有六大难题：</p>

<p>1.没有市场经济经验与制度（无产能）</p>

<p>2.公有制经济、国企产能低下（过剩无效产能）</p>

<p>3.毛泽东时代货币超发（工资物价难平衡）</p>

<p>4.左派普遍抵触与反对改制（保守派故意拖后腿）</p>

<p>5.缺乏经济、学术人才（地方干部只懂计划经济）</p>

<p>6.几乎”无政府“的政府工作无规范不专业的混乱状况（文革后草台班子问题）</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>赵紫阳基本在约十年时间里，把这些问题大体都解决，或者留了后手准备。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>1.没有市场经济经验与制度：</p>

<p>改革所有制结构，确立私人财产保护制度，包括非劳动收入。</p>

<p>对外开放引入外资技术，在地方上扶持私营企业，逐渐下放权力而没有带来生产混乱，承接外向内的投资，输出内向外的贸易，尤其是为了融入全球贸易链，赵力主推动加入关贸总协定（后来的WTO）</p>

<p>通过解绑人口流动性、财产所有权来提高劳动积极性，推动城市经济改革、农村经济改革，双轨制双运行同步发展，让价格改革得以落地。</p>

<p>改制或成立国有商业银行、证券机构（交行、工行等，而四大行的独立与体系化也源自于此时，包括人民银行的中央化）</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>2.公有制经济、国企产能低下：</p>

<p>活化国企产能，让国企对接市场经济，避免一刀切的下岗问题，从而在避免国有资产流失的同时，又能辅助市场产能不足的社会需求。</p>

<p>引进大量外资技术改造国企，目标不是完全去国企化，而是让国企活化承担产能适应新制度。</p>

<p>地方政府财政与地方产能对接，按地方需求生产，减少中央指令式的资源浪费或产能不足现象。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>3.毛泽东时代货币超发：</p>

<p>推动经济发展实际就是在解决超发问题，因为毛时代经济是封闭的一潭死水，改革开放开始后对外贸易与内部私营经济活跃，首先平衡掉毛时代的超发影响，也给政府有能力继续超发货币的空间，从而刺激经济发展。</p>

<p>一直到李鹏时代开始大规模发债，超发货币等方法也被落实成解决问题的基本手法。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>4.左派普遍抵触与反对改制：</p>

<p>邓的政治背书在中央层面减少了推行阻力，胡耀邦当时也吸引了大部分火力，赵紫阳圆滑一些，中前期是可以搞好关系的，但是后来李先念这些就对着干，好在重大制度改革是落成了，可惜左派拖后腿导致第一次价格闯关出差错才落地。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>5.缺乏经济、学术人才：</p>

<p>组建中央农村政策研究室、 中国经济体制改革研究所、 国家经济体制改革委员会等。</p>

<p>接见青年学者，如四君子（其中就有杜润生的学生王岐山），推动莫干山会议，组建学者为核心的智库组织（我国现代行政与经济智库的起源）</p>

<p>与杜润生等改革派老人一起提拔青年学者进入中央，在9号院（ 中共中央农村政策研究室 ）实行小组制，分派到各地调研，这种调研习惯后来成为了党内拓展改革与后续数十年政策思路的主要来源。</p>

<p>邀请两岸三地与国内外的经济学者访问交换意见，以此迭代政府部门的见识与观点，同时促进国内学术圈进步。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>6.几乎”无政府“的政府工作无规范不专业的混乱状况：</p>

<p>经济工作、行政报告与统计的规范化，政府的现代化与行政职能改革，组建现代化政府，引入实质性的管理概念（这里还有胡耀邦党务的推动）</p>

<p>引入联合部门会议，给学术圈与行政人员探讨，反馈问题的机制，比如各地的”会议“，上述成都会议就是政府名义召开更接近于党务与行政层的存在。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1995.4</strong> —–2023-01-25 22:29:25+08:00:</p>

<p>我以后如无意外会做一个合集，但不一定由我发布，可能会托人。</p>

<p>现在还不是时候，有一些资料要整合细化和吸收理解，我目前没时间。另一方面，每次看别人谈这个话题，可以当镜子看有没有新观点是我遗漏的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1995.5</strong> —–2023-01-26 00:41:44+08:00:</p>

<p>中共到现在这个开倒车程度，赵已经不需要被党内平反了，习近平的路线决定了中共翻车以后，中共其他人根本没台阶下，社会对立太过赤裸，六四和赵就是反党大旗。</p>

<p>以前希望平反赵，是党内改良派和社会上的改良派，希望中共自己能纠错，平反赵紫阳和六四，跟拨乱反正平反文革一样。</p>

<p>这样就可以避免中共自身下台，避免社会陷入动荡甚至内战，是有一定前提基础的。</p>

<p>党内的改良派式微，矛盾激增，革命派别就会增加，中共把自己跟六四绑定太死，包袱太大，导致错过了赵认为的最后转型机会</p>

<p>因为改制改制，改的就是六四以来保守派的制，所以赵紫阳把自己跟六四绑定与邓陈、李江对立起来，就注定未来路线斗争中共垮台会遇到胡赵自由化抬头的问题。</p>

<p>不过归根结底，是胡赵选择和站在了人类正确历史路线的道路上。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1995.6</strong> —–2023-02-09 04:57:25+08:00:</p>

<p>两个人都有资料整合，名字分别是《胡耀邦文选》、《赵紫阳文集》</p>

<p>胡耀邦文选墙内允许流通，文选的名字也意味着是有选择性的，可参考性有限。</p>

<p>相对来说胡耀邦的个人资料，建议直接从胡耀邦史料网上获得，这一点是很方便的。</p>

<p>不过胡耀邦史料网是在官方默许下，独立于主流实现外的一个赛博图书馆，有一些是找不到深入记录的，可以拿来当作关键词目录，是入门不错的工具。</p>

<p>其实多数时候胡耀邦的信息事迹，除了维基百科这些能搜到的外，更多是来自于相关人士口述，因为有些东西太敏感，难成资料，但互联网时代后亲历人把经验都转换成了文字。</p>

<p>比如魏京生回忆胡耀邦、李锐一些采访谈胡耀邦之类的，比如李锐口述往事这本书，或者胡德华谈他父亲，杜润生也谈过。</p>

<p>基本上，这个圈子共通性很强，这些老改革派之间互相共事关系亲近，先认识这些人，就知道他们谈的内容脉络，但光记人名也很麻烦，建议先挑感兴趣的事件看发展过程，然后选读其中觉得有必要的部分，慢慢熟悉和记住人名。</p>

<p>除此之外还有胡耀邦生前的直接采访记录，最经典的就是陆铿采访胡耀邦。</p>

<p>赵紫阳相对简单，他的文献记录非常多，进阶入门的《改革历程》读完后，可以去看《赵紫阳文集》，四川卷比较个人化一些，赵紫阳文集跟一条十字路口一样，改革历程更像一个序，读到赵紫阳文集后可以四通八达，如果觉得比较吃力，可以选读宗凤鸣的《赵紫阳软禁中的谈话》，还有杜导正的《杜导正日记》。</p>

<p>赵紫阳嫡系老部下还有一个《赵紫阳在四川》著作，甚至特地拍了访谈视频。</p>

<p>第三方的著作比如《 赵紫阳全传 》或者《赵紫阳：从革命到改良》也是类似传记似覆盖面较大的。</p>

<p>邹至庄也有一个《中国经济学教育与经济改革，周其仁也特地写过回忆赵紫阳的文章，这两个谈赵紫阳个人是比较多的，或者他秘书之一陈仲旋写的纪念赵紫阳的文章都可以一看，这三人谈了很多赵紫阳个人的事，给出了一致的评价。</p>

<p>我个人觉得赵紫阳文集这部巨著配合几个老人的访谈与书籍，构成一个完整的体系。胡耀邦因为没有被完全封杀，反而比较缺乏这方面同量级的系统性著作，资料是相对分散的，但炎黄春秋和胡耀邦身近之人的作品也足够零基础的人去了解。</p>

<p>中国有十几亿人口，虽然是世界工厂对外输出，但是中国的物资与能源这些决定生活水平的东西，也严重依赖外部输入，不能完全自主生产所有商品。</p>

<p>本土可以满足需求的产品，不足以填补生活水平的缺失，而且中国也很依赖出口赚钱。</p>

<p>21年进出口贸易额是6.05万亿美元，出口额3.36万亿美元，进口额2.68万亿美元。</p>

<p>如果制裁，假设进出口同时下跌30%，出口额会变成2.35万亿，进口额会变成1.88万亿。</p>

<p>进口额相当于跌回2014或2017年水平，但要命的是进口额会直接下跌到十一二年前。</p>

<p>出口可能有比较大浮动，但进口通常是稳定增长的。</p>

<p>疫情之前其实出口额大体也就卡在2.2-2.4万亿浮动，进口额则在1.8-2.1万亿浮动，很多生产出口产品的材料和零件也需要进口才行，同时反应社会的消费能力也在稳步增长。</p>

<p>用去年11月的海关数据来看一下可以反应问题：</p>

<p>我国对食品及活动物的产品需求，11月出口66.5亿美元，进口则高达109.9亿。</p>

<p>其中除了咖啡、茶、可可、调味料及其制品、蔬菜水口是出口高于进口。</p>

<p>其余的活动物、肉及肉制品、乳品及蛋品、鱼、甲壳及软体类动物及其制品、谷物及其制品、糖、糖制品及蜂蜜、饲料（不包括未碾磨谷物）、杂项食品。</p>

<p>全部都是进口高于出口。</p>

<p>活动物，出口0.52亿，进口0.72亿</p>

<p>肉及肉制品，出口2.333亿，进口28.3亿</p>

<p>乳品及蛋品，出口0.35亿，进口6.26亿</p>

<p>鱼、甲壳及软体类动物及其制品，出口18.8亿，进口19.22亿</p>

<p>谷物及其制品，出口2.52亿，进口14.19亿</p>

<p>非食用原料（燃料除外），出口20.02亿，进口335.79亿（我不确定自己是不是眼花了，错了的话帮忙纠正下）</p>

<p>矿物燃料、润滑油及有关原料，出口65.62亿，进口482.43亿</p>

<p>未分类的商品，出口46.39亿，进口85.11亿</p>

<p>这些所有进出口产品分为两大类的<strong>初级产品</strong>与<strong>工业产品</strong></p>

<p>初级产品出口157.8亿，进口952.2亿</p>

<p>工业产品出口2797.19亿，进口1310.32亿</p>

<p>11月累积出口2955亿，累积进口2262亿</p>

<p>这些数据反应我们已经脱离了原材料出口，以及我们生活水平提高。</p>

<p>如果从食品上反应，则是我们人口数量过于庞大，国内市场能吃下大部分，反而缺乏足够多的出口余量，比如猪肉就是国内大部分自产自销掉，甚至需要进口部分降低价格。</p>

<p>另一方面也说明我们的进口需求也在与日俱增，消费水平和需求都在增加，尤其是食物上。</p>

<p>目前我们主要靠出口工业产品赚钱，这笔钱不但要反哺原材料进口，还要反哺工业产品的进口需求。</p>

<p>任何强制脱钩行为，都会造成极大的负面影响，无论对内还是对外。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1996.2</strong> —–2023-01-26 19:30:20+08:00:</p>

<p>优质税源被抽走很多，这是分税制下的问题，钱被中央拿走用于转移支付。</p>

<p>看下比例就知道了，中央政府下辖的四个直辖市人口2022年数据是9263万，算浮动可能在1亿冒头，加在一起没广东省多。</p>

<p>截止到去年11月全年累积中央收入8.57万亿，地方收入9.97万亿元。</p>

<p>第七次普查全国人口约14.11亿人，未来方便计算按中央连零头吃掉了1.11亿。</p>

<p>地方的13亿人只创造收入9.97万亿元收入？想也知道是不可能的。</p>

<p>根本问题就是分税制下分配不公的问题，这就导致地方大量省份下辖政府需要发债、依靠土地财政来生存。</p>

<p>如果你给他固定收入，而不是抽走收入，那地方政府有多少钱花多少钱。</p>

<p>你中央政府按比例抽走了他们直接收入来源（税金），自己的分配效率低下，又开了债务和土地财政的口子，地方的债务能不高么。</p>

<p>然后就形成了事多钱少的赤字局面，赤字就要举债或者赤字运行，有债务就有利息，利息越来越高，但地方的畸形结构不改变，债不能停，一停连基本政府职能都无法维持，那只能降低政府运行成本了，比如降低公务员薪酬和待遇。</p>

<p>中央政府对地方的转移支付，其实只够某些穷省不崩盘的，他也不会给你足够资金随意发展。</p>

<p>这就导致其实税金只是收缴上去进行基于政治考虑的低效率分配，吊着一些省份的财政不崩盘而已，这些中西部省份的造血能力仍然羸弱。</p>

<p>而地方政府缺乏财政监督，把地方有限的资源都浪费在基建上，土地财政的钱也会挥霍出去，制造一些毫无经济价值的基建项目。</p>

<p>当然也不能说基建没有，中国人口庞大，基建肯定是有很大需求的，然而一个县政府都能不受控造一些政绩奇观，这些地方对资金的使用审核约等于没有。</p>

<p>花大量现在和未来的政府收入储备，去无法实现经济活化的水泥堆，因为这些地方根本没有人，人口流失到外面，这些建筑业也没有活化的可能。</p>

<p>但造建筑期间，政府发债去推动地方建设产业，可以带来短期的经济增长，这就成了很多地方刷政绩的手段，也是为什么后来GDP挤水分问题严重的一部分，你不可能无限期的建造这些建筑。</p>

<p>如果建筑本身最后不生产任何经济效益，反而导致政府负债累累，并且政府不能崩溃破产导致基层权力真空被人夺去，那中央到地方政府就必须一层层的去救，所以也不能断掉中央的支付转移，一旦停止中西部大把地方政府要财政崩溃。</p>

<p>可也无法指望他们发展起来堵上财政缺口，这种本来不大的财政伤痕，会伴随时间越来越大，那些庞大基建相当于给地方财政来了一个重击。</p>

<p>另一方面，人口聚集的大城市建造基建有必要，但随后发现基建的使用密度过高，因为人口太多了，因此有很高的维护成本。</p>

<p>如果你把基建作为商业产品来运行，那就不是政府的行为，无法提供给社会大众合理的公共服务，违背基建的前提。</p>

<p>但如果不这样去做，政府自己就要硬吞下基建带来的高额维护成本，相当于一份额外开销，发债大兴土木带来的债务利息，基建浪费掉的资金，三者加在一起，赤字其实无法避免。</p>

<p>一旦停止基建建造，地方政府的经济增长就可能熄火，熄火就会有政绩问责，甚至导致资产价格失衡。</p>

<p>行政角度来看是无意义的多次税收分配，人口供需关系失衡，实际是政治问题，因为问责顶多是中共内部的事，政府大规模破产留下权力真空就是要政权下课的前兆。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1996.3</strong> —–2023-01-29 03:31:32+08:00:</p>

<p>问题没严重到那个程度的时候，会有经济制裁反伤自己的顾虑，但中国如果在乌克兰战争后进攻台湾，那是明显奔着打三战去的，有二战绥靖的经验，各国虽然不愿意冒三战风险，但不加紧遏制反而可能会没有传达出明确的警告讯号。</p>

<p>就像二战对德国一样，英法的警告信号不明确，给德国以为可以进一步行动的错觉，最后把大家都拖入二战。</p>

<p>没有证据显示大陆永远不会打台湾，只是成本而已，如果政权存亡在即，依赖对外转移矛盾，那么打台湾也未必不可，反正都是拼死一搏。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1997.1</strong> —–2023-01-26 23:04:52+08:00:</p>

<p>这个原话题的基础，就是在讨论完全解放思想和制度，消除这些环境干预，默认这些枷锁消失后，人口严重衰减与老龄化，各类文娱产业与社会层面的年轻人口比例极低时，是否还能诞生出日韩一样的全球流行亚文化与庞大的亚文化产业。</p>

<p>比如说你的观点是：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>流行文化是<strong>年轻人看的不是年轻人做的</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>我给出的一个回复其实已经终结这个话题了：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>那你看看有没有一直<strong>由老年人主导创造流行文化的社会</strong>。</p>

  <p>这个答案其实非常简单，远的都不用说，就近几年国内的网络梗，蔡徐坤、马保国、东北往事，全都是年轻一代的产物。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>那再来总结你看到的三点，以及你对我观点判断的问题出在哪：</p>

<ol>
  <li>完成工业化或工业化途中搞艺术，从业人员越多佳作越多。</li>
</ol>

<p>作品是结果的体现，而不是原因。</p>

<p>重点在于，什么决定了文化的进步与迭代。</p>

<p>是人，人的存在是一切的源头。</p>

<p>文化的体现我们分为两个类型，一个是专业技术依赖度高的文化，可以理解为影视行业等传统文化产业。</p>

<p>第二个就是生活当中文化的拓展，也即上述提到的鬼畜、网络迷因。</p>

<p>第一部分的专业技术人员，他二十岁入行，可以持续创作和工作到死或者想退休为止，在这个过程里，创作能力的巅峰通常都是青年到中年。</p>

<p>第二部分社会层面文化的迭代上，人们会不断迭代这些现代文化，这也是年轻人创造的。</p>

<p>也就是说，迭代文化的主体，是需要人口不断迭代才能产生的。</p>

<p>你要有潜在的人口基数，在这个人口基数里诞生天赋高的专业人才的可能才更高，并且更多的新增人口基数，也意味着文化的流行程度。</p>

<p>专业的作品需要两类存在，一类是负责创作的核心大脑，另一类是负责施工的手脚。</p>

<p>越是复杂发达的产业，越需要精细化，人口越多基数越大，新增从业者数量也越多，潜在能成为创作大脑的人才库数量也会扩大，同样负责施工的手脚也更多。</p>

<p>不会出现产业头部的创作型人员无手脚可用的局面（当代是已经出现了，比如香港电影的式微，周星驰成龙徐克之流仍然活跃，不考虑他们个人创作巅峰过了的问题，还可以注意到他们的班底瓦解，新班底的质量不足，无法达到原来创作的水平）</p>

<p>类似问题香港电影产业很多人其实都说过，新人入行不足，产业没有新鲜血液，能用的只有一群老人。</p>

<p>老从业者们的风格固定，他们已经有自己的既定模式，他们无法超越自身的限制去凭空创造出一种风格与文化。</p>

<p>1000个人有1000个哈姆雷特，100个人利用科技创造出的2000个哈姆雷特，本质也只是以100个人的观念为模板演化出来的。</p>

<p>因此越多这些潜在人才进入行业，越能带来行业多样性，带来不同的观点，这是一个一潭死水没有新人加入的产业所不能比拟的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.经济不好了，生育率不好了，社会劳动力主要从事别的生产了，导致艺术从业人员不够，那佳作产出就少了。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>严格来说是生育率下降，给社会带来的新鲜血液减少。</p>

<p>每个人都是一个独立观点的来源节点，每个人观察世界的角度和取向都是不同的。</p>

<p>只有更多人进入一种很依赖主观想法构思创作的产业时，这种创作的多样性才能得到保障。</p>

<p>两个时代，时代A有10个人入行，时代B有1万人入行。</p>

<p>首先时代A不能保障10个人全都有可能成长为大师，或者拿出畅销作品。</p>

<p>其次时代B哪怕只有十分之一的人达到了，数字也是远超时代A。</p>

<p>没有新鲜血液进入，意味着一个产业连试错的机会都没有。</p>

<p>重点不是作品，而是人。</p>

<p>我给其他人也用漫画产业举例过了，漫画是个很依赖年轻血液并且深度贴切年轻人流行文化的产业。</p>

<p>为什么上个世纪能出现那么多世界级的漫画家，现在JUMP连台柱都凑不齐了，显然当时的漫画家层出不穷不是一个偶然现象，现在的漫画家数量、质量下滑也是有迹可循的。</p>

<p>作品是一个最终体现，重点是人才的数量。</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.完成工业化后生育率下跌是不可抗的，中国不抓紧这最后一段经济还行，生育率掉了但从业人员还够的时间，以后佳作产出只会越来越少</p>
</blockquote>

<p>并不是说佳作会越来越少，佳作会少只是表象，而且这个描述也不精准，越来越少最后就是零，好的作品是不可能为零的。</p>

<p>重点在于，中国社会在经济还没到足够发达的程度，对内创造出足够形成流行文化的文娱产业体系，作为这种文化产业或现象的主体，年轻人的数量却开始下滑减少。</p>

<p>到最后从全球人类文明来讲，什么会代表我们？成为人们日常接受的亚文化来传播。</p>

<p>这种传播的载体，其诞生背景普遍来自于一种经济发达时期内部流行文化的产物。</p>

<p>比如日本的二次元文化，韩国的韩流，香港的电影产业（更多的是动作片）。</p>

<p>外国人经常提到的kungfu，对外承接的载体主要是香港的动作片，邵氏、李小龙到成龙这些人创造的流行文化，武术自古就有，但现代却拓展成了一种新的代表性文化。</p>

<p>从而通过这种的全球范围接受度高的代表性文化，让自身的文化被世界范围接受。</p>

<p>反例就是印度的歌舞、饮食，他们还没完全发展起来，如果过于本土化的东西，反而不被接受。</p>

<p>但如果他们的经济持续发展，人口不断创造出流行文化到有先进性能被接纳时，就会成为世界范围的亚文化。</p>

<p>日本发展起来后二次元文化就是一个对外最主要的现代流行文化产物。</p>

<p>二次元文化可以是一群中老年人作为专业团队创作，但其受众却始终能覆盖到年轻人，作为流行文化并没有，可见的未来也不会，因为全球范围总是有年轻人不断为其拓展和延伸。</p>

<p>到最后只会是忒修斯之船式的逐渐迁移。</p>

<p>但我们没有这种东西，别说对外，内对都不存在，这里不讨论政策环境，因为这是必须要解禁的，反而没什么讨论必要。</p>

<p>但解禁以后如果没有年轻人口基数的支持，是否就能自然而然出现日韩一样的全球流行文化？</p>

<p>我的答案就是，可能有一部分，因为中国瘦死骆驼比马大。能不能到日韩一样的全球高度，未必，不过我们也许是有机会的，因为未来是不确定的，但已知的人口下滑趋势和文化-经济繁荣的规律是固定的。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>任何事物都有窗口期，不是什么都船到桥头自然直，你说两千年后肯定也能有发达的全球流行文化，那我完全同意，因为未来是无限远的。（比如说日本，现在人口这样了，以后还有没有再创造出跟二次元文化一样繁盛的全球流行文化？那就是无限猴子定理了。）</p>

<p>我们只能用我们出生前后，活在人类社会里的这段时间，将自己的生存时代作为一个参考坐标去判断。</p>

<p>历史上错过了产业升级窗口期，或者改革失败导致的窗口期崩溃，是有很多例子的。</p>

<p>日韩是典型在全面工业化发展后一帆风顺的例子，中国的政治问题，内部的社会矛盾、产业矛盾，可能连经济升级都无法达到日韩同一时期社会发展应有的结果。</p>

<p>归根结底，无论创造的形式，文化的载体为何，都只能是不断有年轻血液进入这些领域，并且社会层面有年轻人创造和接纳流行文化，从而才能保证不断向前推进。</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>这得加一个很强的限定条件：同一类，同一时间，才能满足从业人员越多佳作越多。</p>

  <p>旧的形式已经拍腻或看腻，新的形式还没出现，那这时就是这个行当的淡季</p>

  <p>在做粥喝粥那个比方里，如果这类作品的高度已经很高了，你再不停往这个碗里接粥也增加不了多少高度。观众不新鲜了、兴趣正在别处，你做出来可能叫好不叫座。这粥限量，唐国强把上下五千年都演过一遍了，你还要他怎样。</p>

  <p>佳作产出效率受很多影响，这个题材刚开始做还是已经做了很久，你的文化遗产还剩多少，审查是不是在拖你的后腿</p>

  <p>各方各面，今不如昔，比如新三国不如老三国，今天的台湾流行音乐不如邓丽君那会儿，老年国师不如中青年国师，日本现在的动漫制作水平不如以前大师辈出的时代</p>

  <p>这些经典很多是古典情感结合新技术新手法，把最容易做的题材提走了，顺便还有选择最单一、最容易共鸣的观众。后来的创作者在同类题材上就面临僧多粥少的情形（你觉得唐诗300年持续产出，流行歌30年的繁荣都没有，那就是搞流行音乐的人不行，有没想过这俩不是一个体量的，一年的新歌都比全唐诗多），有水平的都在别处做了突破才能成为新的经典，且难被所有人接受。你不能说人家开发出了新的表现形式，但因为过去没有，所以不能跟过去的经典比，要知道算文化繁荣的时候可不管这是黑米粥还是绿豆粥</p>
</blockquote>

<p>如果只是想学习别人的套路，永远都无法表达出自己应有的东西。</p>

<p>任何人的创造离不开前人的累积，但累积的同时，也是靠后来人不断加入自己的理解。</p>

<p>人们有表达自己这个时代的诉求，才能逐渐形成新兴事物，这是表达欲和创造欲的体现。</p>

<p>拍腻看腻，根本原因是因为拍的不够好，水平不足够只能去寻求同类题材，依靠题材本身堆大众的吸引力，创造新题材的创作者也是需要根据累积下来的东西，进行新的表达。</p>

<p>那么问题来了，谁能带来新的表达？中老年的专业人士也可以有自己的突破。</p>

<p>但更多的是新入行的年轻血液，有自己的看法和有别于过去产业的主观看法，他们的独特世界观形成了这些产业一代代的进步。</p>

<p>唐国强演诸葛亮和雍正是经典，那其他剧为什么也是王侯将相，但归根结底还是这两个更好？</p>

<p>因为就是拍的好，好的东西才能被记住，这就是必须拍的足够好的原因，而拍的足够好需要有产业基础，有数量产出，然后才可能诞生好作品，否则不可能指望拍一部就有一部传世经典。</p>

<p>很多同题材的片，这里面有经典例子，就还用雍正王朝为例，乾隆王朝和康熙王朝拍的就不如它，为什么？因为你导演对剧集的立意就水平不够，不是说题材没有新意了，是你创作者能力不如人。</p>

<p>作品应该呈现什么视角，怎么去表达，情绪怎么铺垫，这些东西就有优劣之分，不能武断的用文物第一的说法，有能力争第一的，至少都是足够优秀了，就像四大名著电视剧集，不是完美无瑕，但瑕不掩瑜，放在一起也没法说谁足够好，可是拿出去就是乱杀新版和一些地方版本。</p>

<p>黑泽明可以把一个非常简单的故事拍的十分有趣，先进性放到现在也是许多导演根本不能比的，说明不是题材的问题，七武士也有翻拍，故事内核不变，可就是水平不如人。</p>

<p>就像你说3D版三国，你说放在国内这个环境上，那的确是对比同行属于鹤立鸡群了，但如果单独作为电视剧本身，它并没有什么很好的情绪表现，叙事也是偏流水账化，这种累积性的情绪爆发同样不见于新三国，观众是有需求的，也能发现你没有这种表达时的问题。</p>

<p>这也不是套路被别人走完了，所以其他人走不了，东映三国志有自己的情绪表达，老三国有自己的情绪表达，到了其他的作品力，这种表达就渐渐流于形式，观众被作品洗礼后，反而走到了创作者的前面，观众明白什么叫恰到好处，而不是过于省略或者抠无意义细节然后流水账，改编就是以创作者的视角在能力范围内，做到最好的平衡。</p>

<p>因为我们个人有表达，想表达出来内心的看法和世界。</p>

<p>所以优秀创作者是不会依赖别人开辟的套路上，形成对他人的路径依赖，这也是许多小说跟风作者的问题。</p>

<p>一个有自我追求的人，即便可能刚从是该行业，需要一个稳定的收入基础，跟风创作套路。</p>

<p>但是他内心的那个表达欲，最终会加入一些自己独有的东西，逐渐形成新事物，而不是单纯的老套路复刻。</p>

<p>所以这就不是容易不容易的题材问题，表现手法和创作者的个人能力，创作者团队的能力，这些东西才是最有要求的，这不能是题材换皮的网文小说套路。</p>

<p>创作、流行文化是一种情绪的传递，一种内在自我表达。</p>

<p>越多人的表达、观念碰撞和交互，越有可能诞生伟大的文化。</p>

<p>人是文化一切载体与形式诞生的基础，凡事应以人为本。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1999.1</strong> —–2023-01-27 19:07:33+08:00:</p>

<p>未来几年主要重点应该是“第三次分配”和“共同富裕”。</p>

<p>开源节流，经济发展造血是最优先项目。</p>

<p>本质都是尝试挽救财政，同时降低社会维稳成本，但毕竟节流不如开源。</p>

<p>如果经济造血的路线实在没戏，达不到在他们制度下产业完全升级和内需消费转型的结果。</p>

<p>就会开始走其他路线进行“开源”。</p>

<p>比如大规模推动第三次分配，搞“共同富裕”，比较富裕的人和中产阶级会受很大影响。</p>

<p>直接税、公共实质性开销降低会成为重点。</p>

<p>并且应该会有一些针对退休和养老金的改动，不能确定是让利还是夺利（提高开支让利，延迟退休夺利，也可能双管齐下）</p>

<p>共同富裕这个框架，估计会有一系列狠活，政府是没钱了，发债都困难，那钱从哪来就一目了然，前三十年有先进的历史经验可以汲取（当然按理是不可能搞到那么夸张，主要是指明该薅谁羊毛）</p>

<p>能想到目前官方已经提出还比较直接，就是吹风有一段时间的直接税，但直接税制度落成需要大量的行政改革，让公职结构和民众都适应，否则反而会增加行政成本。</p>

<p>如果造大蛋糕做不到，而分蛋糕的人要求越来越多，中共只能通过转移部分人的蛋糕到大多数人手里，来平息内部短期的争议。</p>

<p>但根据分税制经验，公平分配只是表现，只会被牢牢把控在政府手里，保持政府控制分蛋糕权力的同时，不分走政府自己的蛋糕，还能控制其他人得到多少蛋糕。</p>

<p>公共服务层面，除了避不开的养老金这种削减余地不大的，再有就是医疗开销。</p>

<p>这方面有很大的动手脚操控空间，比如继续降低医保耗材的质量，反正民众也不懂，能说出来的也就医疗系统，这部分的人嘴巴容易控制（前几年其实已经降过一波医保耗材质量）</p>

<p>然后在少许全国开销低的医疗开支上提高质量或纳保范围，再营销一波降价不降质，用降低耗材的事宣传一波，我估计就这几年会时常见到类似宣传。</p>

<p>因为疫情开放后，入院问题增加，是个长期现象。老龄化社会在未来愈演愈烈，只会有更多人去医院，两者一叠加就会导致开销更大，这个话题更被社会大众不同年龄层关注。</p>

<p>目前更应该关注官方的“共同富裕”会有什么具体方案，如果突然有利好基层的政策，钱从哪里来？</p>

<p>若从中产或富裕阶层处榨取，也许政府是希望在封闭资金外逃的背景下，堵住中产和富裕阶层的退路，把牛养在圈子里产奶吃肉，资金出不去要被征税或其他形式抽血，人出不去就只能利用他们的技能和关系在中国本土给政府产生经济效益。</p>

<p>以此来把部分阶层利益让渡到基层，去平息基层的维稳矛盾，来给政权生存争取更长时间。</p>

<p>但这会永久性改变中国中产阶层、富裕阶层与政府的关系，无异于杀鸡取卵。</p>

<p>如果真的这样做，那我认为政府也是默认自己无法长期统治，有一种“只做好现在，未来的大概率管不了就无所谓了”的味道在。</p>

<p>毕竟基层维稳的冲突和范围是最广泛的，也是事态最容易激化的一个环节。</p>

<p>至于对台作战在蓄力，没准备肯定打不了，而有准备只是需要时有东西可用，不代表是为了最终开展而准备，作为一个万不得已的后手转移内部矛盾的手段。</p>

<p>完全可以，军队清场连中共党内最高层和军队都有大量反对意见。</p>

<p>最后执行下去，完全是靠邓小平个人在党内的权势，压倒了程序，违背了党指挥枪的原则，要不然怎么说六四是军事政变呢？既不符合国家执法程序，也不符合党内程序。</p>

<p>学生放在那，就算你摆烂消极应对，时间到了也就慢慢散了，只不过受损的是中共的威信。</p>

<p>乔石和杨尚昆原本都是反对出兵，张爱萍等好几个将领也联名反对，邓小平坚持出兵才导致六四悲剧。</p>

<p>关键在于学生让中共的威权统治下不来台，邓小平要杀人立威，把改革开放以来自由化风气进行整顿，并不是广场上学生撤不撤的问题。</p>

<p>邓小平自己都知道学生闹事翻不了天，重点是他对六四背后国内政治生态改变是什么态度。</p>

<p>四二六社论能在情况缓和的时候发出，就说明这是延续对八六学潮的打击，要一次性把这件事坐实了。</p>

<p>学生多数人也是从七十年代过来的，很清楚四二六社论是要秋后算账，先把国内舆论坐实，然后借着四二六的定性碰瓷，到时候分散在全国，热度一过，就麻烦大了，所以四二六这个激化矛盾的举措，让学生们不愿意离开，并不是学生不讲理。</p>

<p>当年反右和文革，都是从一个小事上开始，然后一点点扩大，最后定性了，就等于把事坐实。</p>

<p>坚持要么今天讲清楚不算账，要么就无限提高中共处理运动的后果成本，这是正确的做法，邓小平想舒缓矛盾，完全可以不出四二六社论。（包括胡耀邦逝世后，民众和学生自发出来给胡情愿，跑人民大会堂去跪着，邓这个时候出来接见，就没那么多事了，说白了是不满自由化风气，把对方当政治上的敌人看。）</p>

<p>最后就是邓小平宁肯杀人堵死中共改革出路，社会留下一个绕不开的发展死结，也不肯送让渡政治权力。</p>

<p>唯一能控制事态的，就是中共内部政治保守的派别，尤其是邓小平本人，他是最坚定的。</p>

<p>邓小平自己当年也受学生运动的益处，上了位就翻脸，根本不占理。</p>

<p>而且说破天了，学生不走是个法律问题，人民子弟兵枪口对准人民，在共和国的首都腹地随意开火，这是稍微过下脑子都知道错误的事，流弹会不会造成伤亡都完全不考虑，除非无条件拥护威权管制，要不然正常人都知道脑子没问题不会支持这种事。</p>

<p>邓小平这种颠覆体制的军事政变，也直接导致中共内部原来那批从高层到中基层的党员和知识分子离心离德，中共再也没有意识形态上的优势，无法用路线问题解释党与社会的矛盾问题，然后留给中共后来的政府一个碰不得的大炸弹，又拆不掉。</p>

<p>所以从现代政治角度来讲，邓小平在六四处理上是毫无水平。</p>

<p>总有人喜欢说邓公坚决镇压保住中国三十年发展，但完全没意识到从邓开始定调对这种大规模社会矛盾，只有杀人一条路走，没有任何解决和舒缓问题的机制。</p>

<p>经济总会走到尽头，中共遇到执政权的质疑只是时间问题，你现在说他杀的好，未来中共杀的就是你或者你的子女那一辈，一个人再拥护中共都好，都无法控制子女到时候跳出来成为新一代的社会运动抗争者，难道到时候子女或亲人被杀了，粉红还拍手叫好说不忠君爱国，死的好吗？</p>

<p>邓对经济改革没意见，但是完全抵触政治改革，至少他这一代是不允许的。</p>

<p>但经济进行下去，政治迟早是要被倒逼改革，所以邓的三观与时代趋势互相矛盾，最后选择杀人来延续政权几十年的命，但也换来一个没台阶下的局面。</p>

<p>中共内部根据英国政府解密档案，国务院的多个高级人员（国务委员或以上）认为当时无论中共对外，还是政府与军队内部都非常紧张，认为有可能打内战，有一些说法也指赵紫阳也有类似看法。</p>

<p>杀人成功在他这一代不会有问题，延期内战几十年，一切都是“相信后人的智慧”以及“我死后哪管洪水滔天”的翻版。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2002.1</strong> —–2023-01-30 01:16:22+08:00:</p>

<p>如果谈蒋介石在内战失败的原因，无外乎不在乎经济，凡事想毕其功于一役，导致少许军事误判，就让仅有的前期优势都丢光，而中共控制基层，蒋却无稳健的财政来源，因此出现部队缺口根本补不上来，并且抗战期间他能控制的主要基本盘都严重受损，根本不具备同时对内下狠手改革，对外全面与中共开展的基础。</p>

<p>在台湾和中共大陆的问题，在于谁没做错，而不是谁做的更对。</p>

<p>显然中共是做的更错，理想主义式的改革，最后带来了灾难性的影响，毛的农业乌托邦并不能有效与社会兼容运行。</p>

<p>中共批判蒋介石是买办阶级和大地主阶级的代理人用作贬低，是基于中共历史和政治叙事观的结论。</p>

<p>你客观来说，孙中山那一代想反清，普通农民压根不鸟他们，有几个是靠农民起家的，还是要依赖国内的中产阶级和接受新教育思想的基层、知识分子等，这些人后来在发展过程里逐渐转所谓的地主、买办，蒋介石不依靠他们，难道要依靠农民吗？显然不切实际。</p>

<p>因为蒋介石北伐带来了一个很严重的问题，就是北伐战争是类似日本战国时期丰臣秀吉式的外交与战争手段同时实施，速度快但留下了大量的政治版图分裂问题。</p>

<p>尤其是全国兵力过剩，财政不能负担。</p>

<p>明明应该裁军的时期，但因为内部派系拥兵自重难以实行，再有就是裁掉冗兵意味着大量的人吃不到军饷要回去种地，地从哪来？地主手上。</p>

<p>而跟丰臣秀吉不同的地方在于，国民党内部矛盾很大，左右派来回拉扯，党内矛盾最后引发中原大战。</p>

<p>虽然蒋介石最后坐稳，汪精卫和邹鲁等失势，但问题在于中原大战没有决定性的消灭所有反蒋的势力，后续蒋又积极剿共，实际从头到尾都在用兵，而无甚基础去腾出手来专门改革。</p>

<p>等到了台湾，那些原来国民党其他派系的，要么没兵没权，要么留在大陆，长年内部斗争后版图逐渐融合，蒋介石不需要对外作战，有政治环境和精力抽出手来处理台湾本土问题，他是不喜欢中共那套的，所以起码中共走的错路，他看到了也不会走到底。</p>

<p>国民党的内部混乱，孙中山要背大部分锅，晚年没有明确指定好一个接班人，导致胡汪许等核心人物内部矛盾都无法统一，孙中山死后就立刻暴露出来，廖仲恺死后问题更是扩大化，蒋介石趁机上位。</p>

<p>其实战乱年代，军事能力优秀是个很重要的能力，蒋介石上位对国民党来讲是个好事，但是蒋介石根基不如他们，这些人和他们的派系又没死绝，这就又导致国民党浪费大量的精力和时间整理本来统一被孙中山控制的政治版图，进而影响剿共，大幅度拖延蒋介石的“攘外必先安内”战略。</p>

<p>如果当时孙中山提前培育接班人，让许蒋各自负责对外战争、军事改革，让廖仲恺负责财政、农业与劳工改革，汪胡负责行政外交党务，根本不至于民国的黄金十年依然要进行大规模内战。</p>

<p>孙中山是清楚知道国民党的基本盘在哪，所以对外来的苏联和内部的中共，选择联合之余，还有个关键点在于“ 扶助农工 ”，孙中山对要建设什么样的社会是明确有提出的，是包括资产阶级（小资产与民族资产），所以 扶助农工本身就是堵死共产党的发展路线，走左派的路让你无人可用，但也利用外来的苏联资源，学习苏联的制度，形成一个威权化的政党体系。</p>

<p>只要沿着这条路走，其实就不会有太大问题，毛泽东他们走偏了，后来变本加厉，就成了民族灾难，蒋介石虽然烂，但是后面不瞎折腾，选择性保留孙中山的路线后，走对了。</p>

<p>蒋的一个大问题就是，稍微有迫切性的地方，就什么事都要一口气做完，剿共没压住这口气出了西安事变，内战梭哈，赢了还好说，但他不给财政留冗余空间，一旦到消耗阶段供不上，就没后力和任何预备手段了，后面发金圆券的通胀可以看得出他根本不会有效利用财政，总之能榨出钱打仗就可以。</p>

<p>所以他只是按照理性去做事，让人做应该做的事，自然有底子，不会有政治理念上的反理性乌托邦制度非要跟历史趋势较劲。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2002.2</strong> —–2023-01-30 01:42:43+08:00:</p>

<p>如果有充足时间，给蒋介石慢慢发展自己的班底和右派支持者，从基层开始拉公务员的线路，那是有可能的，但需要很长时间，但显然客观环境根本不可能，他在大陆从来没做到过，也不大可能严格按照孙中山路线走，否则就不需要清党了。</p>

<p>中原大战、清党等一系列问题，把国民党原本统一的左右派版图、文武派别全部撕裂，失去了统治和改革的基础，抗日结束后，蒋介石如果不追求毕其功于一役这种方式，而是选择先恢复经济处理内部问题，不纠结于要在中共根基稳健的情况下结束战斗就不会被赶跑。</p>

<p>要硬套的话，清末到共和国建政，到真挺像日本战国，能统一全国的人身死还没指定有威信的接班人，几个主要人物内斗，被其中一人得手，靠军事与外交手段维持表面统一又无法消灭全部对手，最后被第三方势力一锅端。</p>

<p>—– <strong>2002.3</strong> —–2023-02-02 01:50:37+08:00:</p>

<p>这个以前我写过一个帖子，你搜关键词可以看看，那个更详细。</p>

<p>大体上，孙中山不死，或者说多活十几年，国民党不会分裂，并且不会有很多内部矛盾。</p>

<p>孙中山晚年有很多政策可以用左右横跳和冒进来形容，有一些不是错误的，但太着急了。</p>

<p>从孙中山个人的身体状况来判断，我认为是因为他的疾病在扩散，胆囊剧痛越来越频密，身体状况变差，让孙中山急于求成。</p>

<p>典型的可以参考陈炯明与孙中山的关系，陈炯明是孙中山手下很重要的军事依靠，他的叛变导致孙中山的整个计划拖延，并且内部出现分裂。</p>

<p>两人的矛盾抛去国民党后来扣的政治正确反北伐的帽子，主要在于陈炯明希望先发展本地然后慢慢图谋北上，孙中山则追求速战速决，集中力量进行训政，这又是陈炯明反对的，所以政治路线和统一路线的矛盾导致双方闹翻。</p>

<p>如果从后来蒋介石和毛泽东的国共两党来看，孙中山的训政显然是更温和，更尊重党内和地方权力的，国共两党的手段和原则性，都被过于激烈的斗争给拉低了。</p>

<p>其实对比孙中山陈炯明时代的观念反而倒退，属于把孙中山学苏联改造政党里的训政和专政给发扬光大搞出了专精，反而一个丢掉了包含资产阶级，一个丢掉了扶助工农。</p>

<p>因此孙中山与陈炯明主要是路线主张，他们实际要达成的目标是一致的，跟国共两党都不同，只不过是先有鸡还是先有蛋的路线上出现了争执。</p>

<p>假设孙中山没有身体问题， 陈炯明之叛就可能被避免，孙中山不执意在身体垮掉前北伐统一，有更多时间处理内部路线主张的矛盾。</p>

<p>实际上因为陈炯明叛乱，反而导致北伐拖延，没叛乱的话，国民党的基本盘仍然会来自于两广，而不是后来蒋介石内斗上位的江浙，两广系会压倒一切。</p>

<p>陈炯明把广东作为大本营建设的很多方案非常正确，按建设方案看迟早与其他地区拉开距离，孙中山北伐的力量和军事统一效率也会更高。</p>

<p>而孙中山有更多的时间更强的力量，意味着不需要跟蒋介石一切有太多对外的妥协，军事分裂带来的政治分类将减少。</p>

<p>孙中山20年末到21年初就准备北伐，但是双方拉扯到陈炯明彻底失势的1925年，前后花了四五年时间，四五年单纯拿来北伐或者发展，都够积攒相当大的力量。</p>

<p>东北易帜太晚，28年末相当于29年才易帜，日本方面已经开始抽出手来行动。</p>

<p>蒋介石在国民党分裂和粤军分裂的背景下，用2年多完成形式统一。</p>

<p>孙中山亲自坐镇，陈炯明带头北伐，没有内部斗争的损耗，统一只会更快完成，甚至可能一年左右就会逼张作霖表态。</p>

<p>而这个时候时间才1921年到1922年初，22年结束就能完成比蒋介石北伐更紧密的统一。</p>

<p>这时候国民党不会分裂，孙中山有余地选接班人，日军31年才开始搞事，这里面前后近十年时间发展，日本是否还会梭哈去打一个威望极高的领导人在世，经过十年发展，军队派系少向心力强的政权，就算想打，能讨到多少便宜也是能看出结局。</p>

<p>很多时候不是神化某个人的问题，而是历史趋势客观存在，但是这是放大到很长一个历史尺度上，比一个人一生要长的趋势描述。</p>

<p>但是很多时候一个人的存在，决定了一些关键问题的走向，人是创造历史的基本单位，或者说人类社会里的一切客观现象产生的基本原因。</p>

<p>因为有的情况下，政治资源和军事资源是集中在一个人身上的，一个派系和集团靠的可能就是少数人作为凝聚的核心，能够平息矛盾和平衡众人意见，让这个集团运行下去，就跟诸葛亮死了，魏延杨仪姜维费祎这群人立刻闹矛盾一样。</p>

<p>那些控制国民党人脉资源的龙头，比起蒋介石更乐意无条件服从孙中山，因为这些都是孙中山拉起来的，换了一个人谁也不服谁，互相斗争，把原来一个集体的资源互相损耗，袁绍死后，儿子互相斗争导致河北破败也是一个例子。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-01-23~2023-01-29的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-01-23~2023-01-29的言论" /><published>2023-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-29/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>The OP’s <a href="https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/the-steven-crowder-the-daily-wire">article</a>’s headline is somewhat misleading.</p>

<p>First, the word “emotional” is meant to manipulate the reader.  That word is used to imply irrationality, without saying “irrational.”  And if “irrational” is not what OP meant, I suggest better copy editing.  Crowder wasn’t being irrational; the deal the Daily Wire offered was very unsophisticated, incompetently drafted and very heavy handed against the Daily Wire’s potentially recruited talent.</p>

<p>Second, Crowder did not “take . . . public” any contract negotiations.  Crowder unequivocally rejected Boreing’s offer and ended their negotiations, without countering.  The negotiation between Crowder and The Daily Wire ended before Crowder started talking about what happened.</p>

<p>Third, Boreing unilaterally interpreted Crowder’s “public” discussion as an effort to continue negotiation by other means.  Boering speculated that Crowder’s public comments regarding their negotiations and the terms they were negotiating was an effort to continue negotiation by some other means.  A part of me wonders if Boreing quoted Clausewitz while trying to make sense of the situation.</p>

<p>Fourth, Boreing revealed the terms proposed by the Daily Wire’s standard contract and Crowder did not.  I really don’t know what Boreing was thinking.  He is either not even close to as good of a businessman as he thinks he is, or he assumes everyone is just going to hear the amount offered and inquire no further.  But I’m inclined to think Boreing just isn’t very good at making sophisticated offers, forecasting value to be added from a deal or even understanding how value in such a deal is added.  I think Boreing just made the best offer the Daily Wire was in a position to convey given their (limited) understanding of valuing future revenue streams from monetizing talent.</p>

<p>Crowder’s point in going public, however, was that Jeremy Boreing and the Daily Wire’s standard terms placed Crowder on a leash as long as media platforms’ moderation policies.</p>

<p>And he’s right.</p>

<p>The Daily Wire’s terms would have cut Crowder’s production budget and considerably financially penalized Crowder’s company as a result of something totally beyond his control.</p>

<p>And that is unconscionable.</p>

<p>Boreing and the Daily Wire walk away from this looking incompetent.  Not to mention hypocritical.</p>

<p>I’ve only had one woman go into thundercunt mode on me at the gym.</p>

<p>And my response was simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t flatter yourself, darling.  You’re not that attractive.  And you’re not my type, even if you were.</p>

<p>Then she was offended I wasn’t sexually harassing her.</p>

<p>Speaking as someone who once taught similar classes, I think your professor probably doesn’t appreciate how much daylight exists between the things he’s saying and what the class is understanding.  It is also entirely possible that he just doesn’t have a clue how to interpret the actions of other human beings.  I had professors like that when I was an undergraduate and graduate student as well.</p>

<p>I would bet you’re not the only one who is not learning the material, and this is something that should be brought to his attention.  You might not be in the best position to do it, though.  It sounds like he may have been genuinely surprised that anyone might not be following what he’s saying, because I’m sure it’s perfectly clear in his imagination of how he communicated it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had a prof freshman semester that wouldn’t let you go to the bathroom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>College freshmen can be irritating as hell.  But a professor that won’t let students use the restroom likely has psychological, or other behavioral health issues.</p>

<p>I am serious about that, too.  Exercising that level of control over students in a classroom is not something you do if you’re in a proper state.</p>

<p>In my experience, the professors who conduct their affairs with such an attitude also have a delusionally grandiose sense of their own importance and the importance of their material.</p>

<p>Usually, that is to compensate for the fact that such a professor tends to have a low h-index, almost certainly struggles to receive grants and likely hasn’t even published anything anyone cares about in many years (if ever).</p>

<p>There are high-stakes environments, like where one wrong move can result in billion-dollar losses.  But a college freshman class doesn’t even come close.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You tried to? He’d call you out as you were walking, demand to know where you were going, whether it was an emergency, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m going to be very blunt about this: I would have tormented that professor for the rest of the semester.  I had exactly one professor with an ego problem and his professional inferiority became a subject of conversation in every single class.</p>

<p>I routinely volunteered that I noticed how his colleagues wrote papers on subjects he was interested in, which were cited by others in his field as opposed to the papers he wrote.</p>

<p>I found substantive errors throughout numerous of his papers, and related them to the class material in any way I could, for any reason or sometimes for no reason at all other than because I thought he was a jackass.</p>

<p>And he was a jackass.  An insufferable jackass.  So I returned that garbage in kind.  He despised me, and still hates me to this day.  Which is just fine because he’s a fucking idiot, who no one wants to work with.</p>

  <p>You may dislike your professor, and you may not come to lectures, but common social etiquette of attending lectures requires you to sit through the end or sit in the back row if you know you need to leave early.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Former professor here, and I very strongly disagree.</p>

<p>Students have lives outside of my class (I hope), and that’s their business.  Not mine.  When you sit in my class, you are an adult and that’s how you’re going to be treated.</p>

<p>That means I assume that if you leave, you have a good reason to do it.  Or whatever reason you have is at least good enough to justify your action.  That being the case, I’m never going to stop you.  Even if you have a shitty reason, that’s on you.  That’s another part of what being an adult means.</p>

<p>I don’t even care if students learn the material.  If you don’t want to learn what I’m teaching, don’t take my class (or change your areas of focus so it isn’t required).  Just don’t disrupt others who do.</p>

<p>It is not my job to hold your hand through my material.  I will teach and you will learn, assuming you can keep up.  I try to make sure the class can keep up overall and I tailored my approach to account for what an actually reasonable starting point is (with appropriate foundation being laid at each iterative step).</p>

<p>Leaving costs me nothing.  If anything, it reduces the number of bodies in my class.</p>

<p>I also made it very clear to all freshmen I taught that I would not enforce the department’s attendance policy because I thought it was stupid.</p>

<p>The policy was that if you missed more than three classes without a doctor’s note, you had to be dropped half a letter grade.  That policy was imposed by one of my former colleagues, who was so stupid I do not understand how she even managed to obtain a B.S., much less a Ph.D. in anything.</p>

<p>Like most failures in academia, she found her way into university administration.</p>

<p>I also invited my students to e-mail her their thoughts on why her policy was stupid, with specific points that I suggested.</p>

<p>Wow.  I was expecting you to be talking about some intro-level core requirement class.</p>

<p>I must rant a bit.  The following has nothing to do with your comment.  Just my waxing nostalgic about electives in my college days.</p>

<p>I had a philosophy professor encourage the class to experiment with drugs.  Which I of course already was.  We got drunk in the kind of bar where the bartender had a handlebar mustache (that I still remember all these years later) when the class was over.  This was my introduction to Jean Baudrillard, for example.</p>

<p>I had a contemporary film-focused class that once assigned old reruns of my all-time favorite show, Queer as Folk (the Showtime version).</p>

<p>I could go on.  But I think these are what electives should be, in addition to some others that ensure you have some minimal level of cultural literacy.</p>

<p>For example, I took a couple of hard-hitting courses in Russian literature, a course in French lit and several others in non-mathematical philosophy.</p>

<p>You probably were hoping to find something like a source of baseline cultural literacy in your film class.  Instead, you got a basket case.  Next time you see a professor like that, drop their class.</p>

<p>Alright, kiddo.  I’ve got good news.  And I’ve got bad news.</p>

<p>Here’s the good news: I believe you.</p>

<p>Here’s the bad news: The reason I believe you is because I have a little bit of insight into what TurnItIn is and how it works.</p>

<p>What TurnItIn <em>actually</em> measures is not the same thing that it is <em>held out</em> to measure.  That platform is marketed as competent to determine “plagiarism” based on “similarity or dissimilarity with a finite and pathetically flawed set of reference data, which is not even close to the same thing.  Except that isn’t plagiarism.</p>

<p>Plagiarism is when you steal someone else’s ideas and pass them off as your own, like George Lucas did when he made “Dune for idiots,” known as “Star Wars.”</p>

<p>So here are the problems: What exactly is “similarity”?  How is that determined?  How “similar” does some piece of language have to be to some other piece of language, to be flagged as “similar”?  And at exactly what level of generality or specificity?</p>

<p>TurnItIn’s methods are both over-inclusive and under-inclusive.  For example, they’re over-inclusive because they capture a lot more than what is actually plagiarized.  They’re under-inclusive because fail to capture entire universes of what is plagiarized and what might ever be plagiarized (because of their limited reference datasets).  That program doesn’t even have a known error rate, much less anything that might vaguely resemble a method to determine its own error rate.</p>

<p>But the problem is that the people who make decisions about how to detect “plagiarism” are typically brain-dead fuckwits, with about as much cognitive activity as a certain <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/09/fmrisalmon/">fish</a> that participated in an experiment a number of years ago.  And the marketing efforts of the company that makes TurnItIn have as much impact on university admin as the pictures those researchers showed the fish.</p>

<p>Just because you have a piece of alleged technology that says it does something, doesn’t mean that technology actually does the thing it says it does.</p>

<p>TurnItIn is to plagiarism what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_medicine">patent medicines</a> are to health maladies.</p>

To complement these articles, a broad pool of experts were surveyed for their take. As with previous surveys, Foreign Affairs approached dozens of authorities with expertise relevant to the question at hand, along with leading generalists in the field.

<p><strong>From Henry M. Paulson, Jr.:</strong> “…In 2023, unlike 2008, nearly every aspect of Chinese-U.S. relations is viewed by both sides through the prism of national security, even matters that were once regarded as positive, such as job-creating investments or co-innovation in breakthrough technologies. Beijing regards U.S. export controls aimed at protecting the United States’ technologies as a threat to China’s future growth; Washington views anything that could advance China’s technological capability as enabling the rise of a strategic competitor and aiding Beijing’s aggressive military buildup.</p>

<p>China and the United States are in a headlong descent from a competitive but sometimes cooperative relationship to one that is confrontational in nearly every respect. As a result, the United States faces the prospect of putting its companies at a disadvantage relative to its allies, limiting its ability to commercialize innovations. It could lose market share in third countries. For those who fear the United States is losing the competitive race with China, U.S. actions threaten to ensure that fear is realized.”</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-01-16~2023-01-22的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-22/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-01-16~2023-01-22的言论" /><published>2023-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-22/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-22/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Women (usually millennial, white and heterrosexual) describe themselves as “queer” to psychologically rationalize why they’re in their mid-30s, single and have never held a stable relationship.  Having failed to improve their lives by changing their outfits, might as well try their professed “gender identity.”  Doing this also has the additional benefit of putting the world on notice of why it revolves around such a person.</p>

<p>The word “queer” used in the context described by the OP means everything and nothing, at once.  Which is very much the point.  It’s a way of adopting some kind of ostensibly disenfranchised identity, often as a pretext to find new and creative ways to be a Karen (read: insufferable bitch).</p>

<p>I’d tell the atheist kiddo two sets of things.</p>

<p>First, kiddo’s parents and youth pastor are probably stupid.  Both of them responded incorrectly even if kiddo was being brat — and I assume he was.  So, how those adults handled this situation is a reflection of that stupidity.  Not a reflection of the merits of Christianity as such.  The youth pastor didn’t know how to deal with this situation.  The parents didn’t know how to deal with the fact that their kid challenged an authority.  And they probably focused on that, because they weren’t even remotely equipped to handle kiddo’s actual question.</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing that makes kids turn their back on Christianity.  Was very stupid on the part of adults involved, even if kiddo was way out of line.  Which he probably was They disregarded it, because what else was there for them to do?  Bite off more than they will ever be able to chew?  Open a door that might even shake the foundation of their faith?  Not likely.  But when you’re a thirteen year old boy, you challenge that sort of stuff because that’s the only point in your life when the stakes don’t make you immediately back away.</p>

<p>Second, though phrased from the perspective of a thirteen year old boy, kiddo’s question was a lot heavier than it seems at face value.  And it has to be recognized as a serious question, because it gets to the essential point of the problem of evil.  Which is no simple problem.  It’s a big problem.  Arguably the most compelling indictment of Christianity, so complicated that it’s nearly impossible to even conceptualize it outside the context of fiction (e.g., Dostoevsky’s character Ivan Karamazov and the Grand Inquisitor).  This is way out of the parents or the youth pastors’ depth.  Clearly.</p>

<p>Back to the point.  How is Peter Parker not morally superior to God?  God is omniscient.  Spider man is not.  That difference matters for several reasons:</p>

<p>Spiderman’s displeasure with God’s non-intervention ignores the greater problem of God’s intervention in the alternative world.  If God acted consistently with Spiderman’s maxim, then human beings lack agency, will and any capability for salvation.  Consider the world where God acts to prevent all harm.  In so doing, evil is no more.  In this world, we’re back to the pre-Fall scenario that was the garden of Eden, with one critical difference: Eve no longer has the capability to will herself to take a bite of the apple.</p>

<p>The limit of Spiderman’s ability to live his maxim is his own (imaginary) being, because he is not omniscient (nor could he ever prevent all evil).  Spiderman can only, on his best day, act to present specific cases of harm in singular contexts that are defined in relation to his (imaginary) presence.  Basically, Spiderman can’t save the city he isn’t in.  But God can.  As well as the country, nation and entirety of all beings as such.  If God acted as Spiderman, there would be no Spiderman.  Nor would there be any such need.  In this way, human beings will not have been created in God’s image because they would be no more than one of many beasts of the land.</p>

<p>So, I have got to ask this, although I admit, it isn’t about the IS-2, at least not directly.</p>

<p>The KV-2. The terrifying, top-heavy-looking monstrosity that is the KV-2. Whose idea was it, why did nobody at any point say ‘let’s not’, and was it any good? Or, if you prefer a more IS-2-based question, what sorts of design lessons did the KV-2 provide? What worked well, what needed correcting?</p>

<p>For a general survey, William T. Rowe’s <em>China’s Last Empire: The Great Qing</em> is a very good synthesis of the scholarship on the pre-1800 period, albeit with a general geographic bias towards the Yangtze valley and China proper more broadly, over the full scope of the Qing empire.</p>

<p>Peter Perdue’s <em>China Marches West</em> is the book to read on the expansion of Qing rule into Inner Eurasia, although it mainly covers the conquest more than governance. For that, see James Millward’s <em>Beyond the Pass</em> on Xinjiang, Max Oidtmann’s <em>Forging The Golden Urn</em> on Tibet, and/or Johan Elverskog’s <em>Our Great Qing</em> on Mongolia. Matthew Mosca’s <em>From Frontier Policy to Foreign Policy</em> also gets into the matter of Qing understandings of India, which may also be of interest. Looking at a different domain of expansion, Ronald Po’s <em>The Blue Frontier</em> is a good revisionist history of Qing maritime policy.</p>

<p>For a dive into the politics of China Proper, books on controversies seem to be the big ones for getting a glimpse into the inner workings of the state, so have a look at <em>Treason by the Book</em> by Jonathan Spence, which narrates the 1727 Zeng Jing affair, and especially at Philip Kuhn’s <em>Soulstealers</em>, which uses the 1767 queue-cutting panic as a window into the structures of Qing governance. While a little older, James Polachek’s <em>The Inner Opium War</em> is a fascinating little deep-dive into Qing high politics from the end of the Qianlong reign to the early Xianfeng reign. A more focussed study looking specifically at the Jiaqing reign is Wensheng Wang’s <em>White Lotus Rebels and South China Pirates</em>, which attempts to contextualise his reforms in terms of rational responses to real deficiencies, rather than as a sign of ‘dynastic decline’ as Kuhn had framed it. R. Kent Guy’s <em>Qing Governors and Their Provinces</em> is one I have but have not read, but it covers both a wide span of space and time and may be a good single-book choice.</p>

<p>It’s worth also considering the Qing’s more colonial frontiers: Emma Teng’s <em>Taiwan’s Imagined Geography</em>, John Robert Shepard’s <em>Statecraft and Political Economy on the Taiwan Frontier, 1600-1800</em>, and Laura Hostetler’s <em>Qing Colonial Enterprise</em> are all extremely valuable reads on Qing relations with indigenous peoples. The second and third chapters of Norman Smith’s edited volume <em>Empire and Environment in the Making of Manchuria</em> are also worth reading for an understanding of the colonial dynamics of Qing rule in that region, and see also Jonathan Schlesinger’s <em>A World Trimmed With Fur</em> on the broader interaction between ecology, economy, and colonialism on the Qing periphery.</p>

<p>It would be remiss not to include some key cornerstones of ‘New Qing’ historiography as well. The two big ones would be Pamela Crossley’s <em>A Translucent Mirror</em>, about Qianlong-era ideological developments, and Mark Elliott’s <em>The Manchu Way</em>, about the development of the Banner system up to about 1800. There’s also a couple of edited volumes worth looking at: Lynn Struve’s <em>The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time</em> and Millward, Dunnell, Elliott and Forêt’s <em>New Qing Imperial History</em>.</p>

<p>We don’t know precisely why she was fired. The termination notice simply stated that she was fired for ‘breach of contract’ and for spreading rumours, not specifically NDA violations, and Korekore (‘Japanese Keemstar’) insinuated that she had been leaking other info to him in the past. So it could be that her leaks – deliberate or otherwise – in February-March 2022 were the sole cause, or it could be that she had been let off with a warning before and was fired over a repeat offence. We simply do not know the precise reasons, but it’s certainly not due to any company policy around a ‘dating ban’ as some have insinuated (indeed there’s at least one talent at that particular agency who’s been very open about her relationships, and two who are public about having been dating).</p>

<p>Not all VTubers are owned or managed by the same agency, or even under an agency at all. There are 20,000 VTubers in the world as of last November <a href="https://www.userlocal.jp/press/20221129vt/">according to data firm UserLocal</a>, and the two biggest agencies by popularity – Hololive and Nijisanji – account for fewer than 300 (75 from Hololive, 222 from Nijisanji). There are a <em>lot</em> of agencies, but most of them are small, with Hololive and Nijisanji being extreme outliers in terms of both roster and audience size: most agencies will be lucky to pull in 1 million total subscriptions across a dozen or so talents.</p>

<p>Most VTubers, however, are independents: some bigger, some smaller. At one end you have someone like Spanish-speaking VTuber Nimu Spacecat with 2.4m Twitch followers (the most-followed VTuber on Twitch), at the other you have a whole host of really small indies (I wouldn’t even know where to look, but search ‘debut’ on the VirtualYoutubers subreddit and you’ll find a few), with various people in the middle like Nekomiya Hinata or OBKatieKat. It’s a very big space, where the major agencies are really just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Well then. It has happened. As of yesterday (25 January 2023 when I’m writing this), EN VTuber agency Tsunderia has dissolved, with its members continuing as independents. This isn’t necessarily a shocking blow, but it comes at the tail end of a long period of downsizing for the agency since April 2022, when five of its then-twelve members, including Miori Celesta (far and away its most popular member), departed as independents. (The other four were Yazaki Kallin, Matsuro Meru, Nini Yuuna and Orla Gan Ceann). <em>Except</em> this wasn’t wholly the case – in Kallin’s case at least, she was <a href="https://twitter.com/kallinGBN/status/1602806686728732675">loaning her character IP from Tsunderia</a> until she could rebrand, which may also have been true of Orla, who hasn’t been active in some months, possibly for the same reason. Nini Yuuna and Miori Celesta were independents before Tsunderia so continued independent; Matsuro Meru has continued streaming and not promised a rebrand so it’s unclear what’s going on with her.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, when combined with departures of its early members in 2021, after the April 2022 departures all of Generation 1 were gone and the only remaining member of ‘Generation 0’ was Inukai Purin, who <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunderia_us/status/1617341472914677763">announced her departure on 22 January</a>, leading to – or perhaps pre-empting – <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunderia_us/status/1618443736622501888">the announcement of the agency’s closure yesterday.</a></p>

<p>So what does this all mean? Very little.</p>

<p>If we zoom out a bit, at one stage Tsunderia was one of five notable mid-sized EN agencies, alongside Cyberlive, Phase-Connect, PRISM Project, and Production Kawaii. These were agencies with around 20k mean subscribers per talent, and between half a dozen and a dozen talents, which is decently respectable all told in a relatively saturated market. (That said, Tsunderia’s apparent size was inflated heavily by the presence of Miori, whose 217k subscribers represented two-thirds of the agency’s combined subs.) Ironically, after a series of featurettes written on these five agencies on the VirtualYoutubers subreddit in February 2022, the troubles began. Tsunderia’s I’ve mentioned, but Cyberlive also had its fair share of issues: in March, two of its nine members transferred to Phase-Connect; in May, issues with some of its staff failing to meet commitments led to the agency reorganising into an indie network, Aetheria; in October, misconduct accusations against the agency’s main manager led to Aetheria dissolving outright. With that, the EN mid-tier has been reduced to three agencies, and interestingly, the two that have shuttered are both US-based, while of the remainder, two are headquartered in Japan and one is based in Canada.</p>

<p>Except Tsunderia’s shrinkage has coincided with the emergence and growth of other agencies. Phase-Connect, PRISM Project, and Production Kawaii are all doing well for themselves*, and there are now a number of potential emerging players albeit with smaller numbers at present: Israel-based Idol Corp, Singapore-based VReverie, and Taiwan-based Akio Air. So it’s not like there aren’t small EN agencies emerging to fill the gap. It just remains to be seen which ones can establish themselves, and which ones end up quietly going the same way.</p>

<p>* There may be some caveats to that though. Production Kawaii has been accused on occasion of inept management, while Phase-Connect is riding heavily on the success of Pipkin Pippa, who is basically 4chan personified. So there are reasons to also ‘hrmmm’ a bit there.</p>

<p>22年按道理是负增长没跑了，21年自然增长率是0.34%，死亡人口1014万人。</p>

<p>哪怕不考虑年末疫情放开导致的死亡，也差不多得在1150万浮动。</p>

<p>但是年末突然放开导致的医疗资源挤兑死亡和直接死亡不好算，但还是能算的，等二月末统计公报出来就知道去年年末死多少人了。（虽然现在也能算就是了）</p>

<p>我很好奇到时候社会反应。</p>

<p>说明现在不同网络社区没有那么多模糊的灰色地带</p>

<p>群体之间的政治观念和对立越来越清晰，用户输出的也越来越纯粹或者说极端</p>

<p>最早追求理性讨论，是因为大环境除了骂就是骂，而社会的进程还停留在上升期，所以互相立场对立骂再多，社会不会给一个答案，所以对问题和效率的追求，促成了中立地带的存在，因为客观上无论粉红还是反贼，骂是骂不出结果的，因此要找问题根源。</p>

<p>但是现在不同，从2019年开始到2023年，经济已经开始走向增长极限，社会的财富分配不公，累积了更多的情绪，有更多新人涌入，他们来不是需求答案，他们已经站好队了。</p>

<p>而社区的职能是在这几年当中，不断的思想碰撞和赛博政治斗争里，碰撞出理论和现实层面都具备先进性的观点，从而形成一整套键政体系，去解释现实问题里发生的事，从而获得舆论高地。</p>

<p>我还记得2019年很多人对香港人的做法不理解甚至完全反对，但是到了2022年，别说反贼了，就是国内知乎B站这些地方扫几眼，相关香港和延伸含沙射影的话题已经变了立场。</p>

<p>尤其是去年各种合订本，官方支持的基本都被合订本清算了，说明社会层面，对清算粉红和社达的主观意愿非常强，并且这类人占多数，因此我建议有以上两种倾向的人在未来十年到十五年，做好要么退网不关心这些，要么做好被人翻旧账清算的准备，只要支持热门话题，都会有人主动进行合订本。</p>

<p>说明年轻人对这些社会与政治话题，已经产生了主动与官方唱反调的心态。</p>

<p>固然输出情绪和月经贴不好（比如说毛的黑料，其实对老键政人来说已经不太关心，可能刚开始键政的人因为才见到，或者感兴趣，所以会特地发出来分享，这是经验和心态的不同。）</p>

<p>但更重要的是中文键政社区，已经开始形成了庞大的固定派系。</p>

<p>人们更多可能等待的不是讨论的过程可以得出什么样的观点，而是希望有结果了。</p>

<p>而结果又是一个客观上需要等待的事，所以在能脱离键盘主动参与社会事务前，都很容易伴随新人涌入，反复在一个键政早期状态重现特定场景（而很多过去的社区，是有经验的键政人士集体构建的，相对而言一些老生常谈的话题就不那么容易被提及，恰巧新人与老人共用一个社区）</p>

<p>我的建议是老人更多发自己领域里感兴趣的话题，这一点我看sub也在做百科，帮助键政新人学习和进步转型，毕竟帖子数量不怕多。</p>

<p>能说话，说得出来可以讨论，不用打哑谜，就是比NGA有绝对优势，且可见未来都不会被NGA取代的一个优点。</p>

<p>我觉得香港的厌恶情绪是普遍的，戾气确实是很重，包括对香港人内部也是，说话很喜欢拖长音调。</p>

<p>戾气的问题连登在2019年可以体现出来（当然日常也有），而且香港人说话在很多圈子里爆粗口，张嘴闭嘴不理生殖器官是非常常见的一种现象，跟说顺口溜一样，我个人很讨厌这种说话习惯。</p>

<p>经常要在一堆妈、 鳩 、 撚、7、屌、西字里面找正常言语描述，我很难理解香港有的人离开这些字就不会说话的情况，大陆普通话交流，就算带傻逼这些的称呼，不是互相吵架，也很少看到动辄带这些字眼的情况，倒不如说香港某些群体的粗口完全日常化了。</p>

<p>一定程度上我认为是因为香港的社会过于内卷化，过密劳动和居住环境的压力磨损了大部分友善的可能性，但我觉得还是分人。</p>

<p>家教良好的也不是没遇到过，警察家庭出身，完全感受不到市井香港人的气息，跟套皮日本人一样，说话完全没有那种很刻意拖长音调的语言习惯，也有基层出身的朋友，这两人都是从小到大都不说脏话，基层出身的朋友气急了才有可能骂几句顶你个肺或爆粗一丁点的情况，警察家庭出身从来没听说过爆粗，两人都没有拖长音调的口音习惯，粤语都是快短正。</p>

<p>所以以前在香港接触那些说话喜欢拖长音调的，好像在用长音调对我表达不满的，我当场都会直接问对方这种语气是什么意思来把事情上纲上线，因为更早期我以为是粤语就这样，但后来发现不是，这是纯粹语气问题，粤语里刻意拖长音调从人际交往的经验来看，是非常不礼貌的行为。</p>

<p>比如还遇到过一个台湾读到博士的人，素质和做人也是极其差，说话的用词语调跟香港那种惹人厌的情况就一样了。遇到台湾友善的人也很友善，但在我个人看来，香港人说普通话和台湾口音，就算是说话恶狠狠，但因为口音缘故听起来就威胁度不高，怎么听都软绵绵的顺耳状况。</p>

<p>这些经验告诉我，既有普遍情况，在普遍情况之上也都是相对的，不用太看重，眼下谁碰瓷就干挺他就行了。</p>

<p>按道理今明两年应该回光返照，吃报复性消费和搞经济的迫切需求增长明显起来。</p>

<p>如果这几年都没折腾起来，其他的就不用想了，因为疫情把政府财政的运行下限暴露了出来，这个是过去中共不愿意也不敢让人知道的。</p>

<p>而疫情期间前后各种该操作，22年的合订本多到记不过来，也能反映他们内部行政有多大的延迟性和缺乏协调，光一个疫情开放，各地都难以统一。</p>

<p>如果中央控制力真的那么好，就不会出现调度不一，那说明什么，说明中央的调度控制问题很大，哪怕是最高层的直接命令，地方的执行也是不确定性拉满。</p>

<p>除了债务增发推动土地财政和基建建设，目前看不到什么有效的经济增长点。</p>

<p>总体上我不认为政府长期政策会跟过去几年有什么区别，相反会因为经济下滑，社会不稳定性大幅度增加而变本加厉，并且伴随他们的草台班子属性愈演愈烈，错误的政策更多，临时性的拍脑袋方案也会造成社会和国民的大量损失。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1977.2</strong> —–2023-01-16 22:04:22+08:00:</p>

<p>3和4从疫情开放的过程来看，静态事件由中央发放命令是可以执行的，但是动态上地方执行命令，各地调度严重不一，开放顺序不同，可能已经接近改革开发后中共对基层的控制能力历史极限。</p>

<p>如果财政支持到这种程度都无法达成，后面要么军管，要么就是不大可能做得到了，除非信用分系统伴随封控经验一起来，实施过程里社会还没怨言不反抗。</p>

<p>基本处于政府越想加大控制，资源投入需求越大，跟着不稳定因素增加越需要控制的恶性循环。</p>

<p>下阶段政府施政重点集中在第三次分配，也是习近平第三任期的一个对内主要政策目标上。</p>

<p>按以往的逻辑推测，是聚焦在如何殴打中产和巨富让他们吐出一部分利益，来让利给平民，从而减缓社会矛盾的做法。</p>

<p>既要做到让平民不得不掏钱继续买房供养政府运行，也要保证中产和企业巨富肯交钱到政府手里，政府再用类似分税制的手法，按政府执政需求分配给平民，多出来的就自然盈余在政府手中了。</p>

<p>B站有个做农村纪实的UP主叫遇真纪事，之前就做过农村交粮和养老金现状，反应的很不错，看弹幕其实能发现，很多现代年轻人如果不是农村出身，可能都不清楚农村现在的状况，更不知道以前农村除了要干活出力、还要出钱出粮去配合政策。</p>

<p>而且农民过去不让随便到城镇落户就业，不让随意流动，一直到改革开放了才允许农业人口有限度的流动，然后一点点打开了农业人口流动的历史浪潮。</p>

<p>农村人口不解放，不富裕，中国的经济成果很难再更上一层楼。</p>

<p>别说经济层面不把农村当人，就连道德层面也说不过去，哪有把同胞当大牲口一样的。</p>

<p>过去都调侃印度十亿牲口，这几年就没什么人敢说了。</p>

<p>中国互联网让阶级之间的距离拉近了，但有时候更像各种类人群星闪耀时，各种何不食肉糜的言论层出不穷。</p>

<p>温铁军早期兴起，就有很多人说他敢说敢讲，为农村和农民发声，但你稍微了解温铁军和农村的状况，都知道他那的观点实际更多是继续利用农民这一身份来保证现行体制稳定，现在也慢慢有人回过味了。</p>

<p>国内有个问题，正常市场竞争，出手的价格肯定应该是利润来源。</p>

<p>但我国是官方控制价格，农民很难直接从市场里做大，因为控制价格，所以补贴反而很重要。</p>

<p>而政府不会给对应的市场价格补贴，而是给饿不死农民的价格。</p>

<p>相当等于农民没有选择价格的权力，不得不卖，政府借此获得输入市场的低价粮食，从而稳定物价。</p>

<p>另一面再通过补贴渠道，把农民收入的额度控制在自己手里，化身赚差价的中间商，既控制农民出手价格，也以补贴名义控制农民实际所得。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1978.3</strong> —–2023-01-19 01:04:39+08:00:</p>

<p>你是不是没搞清楚我在说什么？</p>

<p>—– <strong>1978.4</strong> —–2023-01-19 12:38:09+08:00:</p>

<p>农民是生产方，粮食是硬通货，决定了再怎么卖，都肯定有市场。</p>

<p>但粮食的价格不由农民自己定，这就导致市场价格不以农民的生产和利润为标准，也就导致农民很难靠从事农业本质做大。</p>

<p>土地问题本身就是一个所有制和产权问题，不允许私人永久性获得土地产权，导致农村人口流出口，土地无法并拢在少数愿意留下当农民的人手里。</p>

<p>这就形成了耕地裂成碎片，高不成低不就，哪怕你土地多一些，但你出售粮食的价格控制权也不在自己手里。</p>

<p>那就相当于生产环节被堵死，销售环节也被堵死，只能吃政府补贴勉强活着。</p>

<p>政府给你多少补贴就是多少，但生产和销售的障碍又是政府设置的。</p>

<p>比不上进口产品其实根本不重要，因为现在的土地生产模式就很难降低成本，国外都是大农场，土地高度集中在少数人手里，有工业化的优势，耕种成本低。</p>

<p>国内的问题我上述说完，君所知之，农民只能在谷贱伤农的基础上被迫接受政府方案，然后政府靠小恩小惠的补贴控制农民一年利润所得，他们认为一年应该赚一万块利润，补贴价就低一些。</p>

<p>如果你是农民，你生产的产品虽然比国外的贵一些，但是毕竟是硬通货，本土生产有运输成本优势，进口产品的数量始终无法供给到全国，无论如何都是有市场的。</p>

<p>但是现在问题来了，我是政府，你卖大豆的利润是5元，我给你的指导价是2元，进口的是3元，你必须服从我用亏本的价格卖出去，然后我通过其他渠道，均价给你补上1元的利润。</p>

<p>也就是说政府操作后，农民失去是失去了自己决定利润上限的可能，你只能赚官方希望你赚的钱，你的实际收益从农产品，变成了种农产品后的补贴，而补贴多寡决定权在政府手里，而不是你的手里。</p>

<p>这些并不是外国便宜所以国内贵一点竞争不过的市场问题，国内市场和面积极大，需求是源源不断的，远没有敏感到差一点就没市场的情况，问题出在生产和市场环节有行政干预，更别说基本国策比如土地、户籍这些了。</p>

<p>说白了就是把农民变成佃户，甚至可以说是农奴。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1978.5</strong> —–2023-01-19 14:48:37+08:00:</p>

<p>本身粮食就是本土生产有运输优势，这个你接触农产品和我国生产的主食都能了解到。</p>

<p>举例，猪肉我国生产占全球一半，巴西进口猪肉部分情况可能更便宜，但不会销售到全国各地，因为销售所需要的包装、冷链会提高成本。</p>

<p>维持我国主要肉食的猪肉，就是依靠各地省市附近就地销售为主，尤其是通过收购养猪散户 ，这也是为什么几年前猪瘟时价格波动极大，因为做不到隔离生产。</p>

<p>否则货源减少价格只会影响依赖外部运输的城市，这是个基本常识，因为政府要稳定大城市价格，反而出现了集中供货到大城市，但数量不足，进而导致大小城市一起涨价的问题，也反映出就地销售的客观情况。</p>

<p>因为我国大多数都是本地农民自产自销，远距离运输与销售成本不是农民个体能负担的，这也是为什么一些销售平台与较大的农业公司有议价优势。</p>

<p>包括蔬菜也是，具体可以参考《<strong>国务院关于进一步促进蔬菜生产，保障市场供应和价格基本稳定的通知</strong>》</p>

<p>里面提到： 严厉打击囤积居奇、欺行霸市、串谋涨价等不法行为，维护正常市场秩序 。</p>

<p>这条通知针对重点是保障城市的蔬菜供应价格稳定，国内没政治和市场环境允许一个庞大到政府都控制不了的中间商阶层去赚高额差价，说白了就是政府行政手段抑制农产品的价格。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>而且我发现你把农业国内外的情况想的太过简化，没搞明白有什么区别。</p>

<p>国外允许土地流转，农村人口可以流入城市，让农村土地收购成本下降。</p>

<p>因此出现了少数人耕种多数土地，然后通过机械化弥补了人力缺失，同时提高了农民的人均收入，本质上美国农民都是有大片农场的农场主，跟国内的农民已经是两个阶级，”农民“伴随这种情况，在美国逐渐变成了一种高技术的专业职业。（事实上发达国家基本都是这种趋势)</p>

<p>而这种超大规模耕作的农场主，他们的销售市场除了国内，还有相当部分是国际市场，这也农场主则依赖跨国际的收购商，不能决定的利润问题在于开支和农产品销售价在国际市场的波动性，而不是美国联邦政府强行把该压低的和不该压低的都控制起来。</p>

<p>美国农民的主要开销成本来自于农资，提高耕种效率和生产效率往往需要更好的化肥和农业设备，一台机器可能就几十万上百万，这种情况除了地方农民抱团购买轮流使用，就是推高杠杆率去借贷。</p>

<p>这种情况下其他产业如果产品不是世界性刚需，很容易崩盘，但因为农产品是刚需，所以农场主至少可以在这个背景下去预期利润，也因为这种地主承担风险的模式不是每个人都愿意。</p>

<p>所以出了专业化的佃户，但收取的劳动报酬跟城市白领甚至中产无异，这是农业复杂度提高后无地农民的议价权体现。</p>

<p>国内的问题是什么呢？农资的定价权不是完全市场化，收购价实际很受政府在地方的指导价格影响，只要是农产品都受这方面影响。</p>

<p>收购批发价指决定农产品的基础价格，农民生产成本和政府指导价格，决定了最终价格，可以参考国家统计局在2014年的《<strong>我国主要农产品生产流通消费价格关系研究</strong>》</p>

<p>而农民的生产价格，则取决于农资、人力成本和耕地成本，耕地成本因为是没有私人土地，因此难以靠并购扩大面积来降低个人成本，个人的负担没有减少，人力就更不可能抽身，学现代化国家的农村一样，走不承担土地成本的专业农民或地主路线，只能个人同时承担两个角色。</p>

<p>既要背负土地耕种成本风险，还要完全靠自己出人力，而不是找无地的雇佣农民执行。</p>

<p>农资则是这种畸形背景下的另一个大头。</p>

<p>去年年初为保护春耕，中央<strong>只拨款资金200亿元发放一次性补贴，针对夏粮的农业生产和水利救灾只有16亿元</strong>。</p>

<p>而近几年因为煤炭价格提高，化肥价格也提高，让农资成本提高30%到50%不等，政府提供的这些资金，对比农民人数，基本就是毫无卵用。</p>

<p>并且还建立了以供销合作社为中心的化肥稳价保供工作机制，流通方面政府自己都指出，要靠供销社系统积极与上游重点生产企业开展产销对接。</p>

<p>举例子，<strong>湘乡市一地的化肥，合作社就占当地市场份额80%以上</strong>，所以农资成本主要来自哪是显而易见的。</p>

<p>市场需要分工，所以收购的批发商才有一个基础农产品价格。</p>

<p>然而政府在市场里的分工，恰巧是市场不需要的寄生物，政府既充当一个农资供应价格控制者，也充当一个农产品批发价格的指导者， 那么农资企业、农民、批发商的利润都取决于政府稳定物价的需求，根本没法按照实际供需关系通胀。</p>

<p>这也是为什么粮食安全越来越弱的原因，因为要稳定的城市的消费需求是无线增长的，经济增长时对农产品需求增加，农民还可以靠农产品薄利多销在政府的价格干预下勉强生存。</p>

<p>但是随着经济下滑需求减少，利润下降而政府不可能改变干预模式，或者反过来说需求不断增长，而人力无法达到薄利多销的标准线，农民就会陷入返贫，所以这几年农村建设越来越拉跨，扶贫反而不断有人返贫就是这个原因。</p>

<p>农村年轻人外逃当下背景就不是因为城市有发展前途（户籍把你卡死，你也没办法挣扎），而是农村没有未来才是关键。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1978.6</strong> —–2023-01-22 22:56:45+08:00:</p>

<p>农产品本来也可以私人收购，上面有提到。</p>

<p>这个地方容易进入盲区的一点是，行政干预力量隐形化，因为市场机制逐渐重要，政府的行政手段实际是退出了直接提供指定价格的模式。</p>

<p>这也是为什么上面所说的农资成了新的干预农业价格的方法，可以去看供销社在全国的化肥供应比例。</p>

<p>而且实际上商户销售农资的收益也不高，大概十年前经济参考报写过一篇这方面的文章，指农资利润空间也很低，但即便如此农民积极性也不高，农资需求反而一直下跌。</p>

<p>这就造成了两头难的局面，农民积极新低，销售农资的个体利润也低，这种积极新从哪能调动呢？土地和产权所有制就是一个重大突破点了。</p>

<p>即是说，政府通过原本计划经济时代的指定价格方式，逐渐过渡到了深层面的另一种干预体系。</p>

<p>2015年的《关于深化供销合作社综合改革的决定》 ，他们的核心逻辑是“ 大田托管、代耕代种、股份合作、以销定产 ”</p>

<p>其实你单独看这些东西，思路是没问题的，但你想一下国内的政治环境与背景，就能明白问题出在哪。</p>

<p>政府跳过了你种好粮食再去获得资源这部分，直接到你种粮食所需的基本农资，供应权的构成与行政干预渠道大多在政府手中，另一方面再通过行政手段微操批发商相关政策。</p>

<p>让“双轨制”（农村-城市的二元结构）能适应市场机制，这也是为什么之前猪瘟干死很多养猪散户后，政府大张旗鼓开始进入农村的农贸市场，推行大企业模式，不单是养猪，在地方销售上也推动集中在少数渠道里。</p>

<p>这是《 中共中央国务院关于加快建设全国统一大市场的意见 》的一部分，可以把情况理解为政府希望集中到他们能认知和干预到的少数贸易节点，从该系统更好的去不推翻市场机制的前提下，干预市场而避开责任追究。</p>

<p>脱离农业，其实就可以看国内舆论常常骂道的，都是资本家的坏，实际政府在暗地里扮演了一个主要获利者的身份，类似的还有房地产，政府只出土地财政，再掉头压低地产商的利润空间。</p>

<p>区别是，政府对农村的价格干涉与控制，主要集中在供需关系上，农村更多接近劳动力供给的定位，政府的实际开销则要依赖城市阶级。</p>

<p>其实赵在八十年代搞土地改革，重点突破就是如何调动农民积极性，放权和产权所有制就是关键，当时已经看到这个问题的根源，但哪怕现在都做不到足够好，反应很多政治问题。</p>

<p>继续卡在这个环节，很容易拉美化，所谓的中等收入陷阱，因为靠人力维持的户籍制度，行政力量也是需要资金才行，一旦工业升级碰壁没法反哺，人口转化失败，我们在老龄化下是没退路的。</p>

<p>就会出现大量农村人口不受控涌入城市，而城市不能提供合理就业与物资价格，进而出现贫民窟。</p>

<p>因此土地分配问题直接决定效率问题，但是跟赵时期不同的是，现在农村劳动力缺失，地都种不上，更别谈积极性了。</p>

<p>如果我们能把土地所有制改革，进一步给农民放权，农产品定价权方面政府的行政干预退出机制，打破城乡二元化的双轨制。</p>

<p>解放农民进城的劳动力限制，空出土地来降低收购成本，并且政府或者说供销社提供贷款去进行早期普遍工业化。（我个人认为应该是供销社承担这个职责，让供销社去政治目的化，转型成一个全国性农协，类似日本的平衡机制，由农民自下而上通过供销社掌握定价权）</p>

<p>这样组合拳才能解决问题，并且也变相能减轻农村的基建失衡现象，人口的自由流动与土地所有权的解放，这两大制度我认为可以是中国除开民主化外最重要的，最应该落实的。</p>

<p>会成功，但归根结底是催动社会原有的结构矛盾。</p>

<p>原本只求经济、发展和人心求稳，是民众与中共政权的一致默契，这达成了六四以来的勉强稳定，在经济发展的基础上，政府得到大量资源，去维稳和压制不稳定因素（比如农村人口）。</p>

<p>大概率不会成为被剥削而不稳定因素的市民阶级，则吃到发展红利，但随着土地财政和各类生活需求的指标提高，消费升级后政府无法提供更多让利，导致近几年的不满声音愈发明显。</p>

<p>早期城市阶级出身的人口，大多是以知识分子和部分中产、基层农民劳工为主的，对政治观念上的不满，这是七十年代以来部分自由化思潮催生的需求，但当时社会还没发展到接近饱和状态，因此一旦经济有增长改善生活的空间，稳定的需求就大于形而上的思想观念需求。</p>

<p>伴随数十年来的经济增长，目前人口资源的正式枯竭，宣告过去那种密集型劳动产业将开始衰败，而政权本身没有给出一个产业升级的具体路线图，也没有改善劳工待遇的路线图。</p>

<p>这说明继续改革下去，哪怕榨干企业巨富和中产阶级，也迟早要面临无财源可用的局面。</p>

<p>毕竟创造财富的是人民群众，而不是中共政权本身，一旦生活水平保持长期零增长，不满因素就会逐渐因为各种小意外累积，进而出现合订本。</p>

<p>事实上合订本的出现本身就是反应国内社会有相当大的一部分人，是非常不满意政权的一些行为的。</p>

<p>而中国是个极其庞大的国家，人口需求的资源很依赖进口，很低经济增长或者停滞，无可避免因为外部通常导致购买成本下降，而本国内的出口产品竞争优势不明显或可被取代，搞不好一些数量少无法压低价格的进口产品都会贵起来，这会直接影响生活质量。</p>

<p>哪怕便宜的产品，比如农产品，国外的输入价极低，政府只能不断提高补贴农民的价格，避免农民放弃耕地带来连锁反应，美国政府如果程序渠道做得到，也完全可以针对中国一面禁运不让出来，进入最大的消费市场，一面大幅度围绕中国市场提供补贴，从而在国内不得不买的情况下，无限提高中共政府执政的成本。</p>

<p>中共最蠢的一点就是滥用中国市场的规模优势，诚然已经发展的中国市场怎么都不会萎缩太过，但中共不愿意让利来推动消费升级，还增加太多政治因素的行政干扰，导致企业进入中国市场难，出去难，利润都不让随便汇走，然后折腾一圈发现虽然也赚钱，但中国消费者的消费能力却没有与日俱增。</p>

<p>因为中共不肯让利与民众，土地财政耗干了六个钱包，自然无法成为一个有活力且消费能力出色的庞大市场，也就逐渐没有底牌去对国际企业吆五喝六。</p>

<p>可是呢，反过来中国的庞大人口对中共也是个负担，如果他们跟外面搞好关系，对内部怎么折腾其实问题都不大。</p>

<p>但是中国的人口和消费需求，意味着要大量进口才能保持现在的生活水平，否则就要面临物价增长与生活水平下降的问题。</p>

<p>比如猪肉就是个经典例子，中国生产全世界一半猪肉，但仍然需要进口为价格上涨做潜在的缓冲区（虽然猪瘟时期是远远不够的），猪肉价格增长过度直接冲击餐饮业，会造成大量失业，维稳成本暴增。</p>

<p>美国政府现在有意切割，减少直接的干预和接触，主要从经济层面做有效封锁，然后把球踢给中国政府，跟着等国内出变化。</p>

<p>就算国内用“帝国主义亡我之心”的套路去试图凝聚人心，问题还是会回到一个原点。</p>

<p>比如说，“现在美帝国主义是这么穷凶极恶了，外面改变不了他们，但生活还要继续，党国你看你们是不是也拿出点诚意来滋润滋润我们呢？”</p>

<p>与外部的贸易是资源平衡和输入的主要手段，现在与外部的贸易接触减少，可替代性增加，中共无法变出资源来给国内社会打鸡血，你就算处理经济精英与知识精英这些富豪或中产，也会把他们得罪了，而社会上迟早有人要成为他们，晋升到这个阶级，你这样做了，基层跨阶级的人又怎么想。</p>

<p>过去中共通过把政治精英、知识精英和经济精英利用发展绑在一根绳子上，利用社会求稳的需求才能让一切安好，如今不做内部让利，他们自身生存不下去，做让利了，原来绑定在一起的政治联盟就会分崩瓦解，社会内部的矛盾就会暴露出来。</p>

<p>美国智库恐怕肯定有人这样说过，“我们不需要与中国政府停止往来，只需要继续进行有限度的贸易，躲到远远的等着，中国民众会为了生活水平自己在未来找出道路”。</p>

<p>杀人等于把问题摆上台面，承认问题的存在，并且问题到了不杀人解决不了的程度，这与政府宣传的和谐社会、稳定社会是完全互相抵触的。</p>

<p>而且自诩合法统治政权，杀人会彻底失去法理性，所以中共对六四避而不谈，并且指出问题不在自己，意在推卸责任。</p>

<p>任何时候，杀人都是解决问题的最后办法，靠杀人解决问题在现代社会，把财产所有权都放出去后，政府管不了农民也管不了城市阶级，这样做相当于放弃自身法理地位，让政府失去威权地位。</p>

<p>合法性的获取即便是古代王朝随意屠城的年代，也不能单纯靠杀戮来获取，近代也讲究一个意识形态。</p>

<p>政府的意识形态已经破产，唯一获得合法性的来源就是经济增长，经济问题导致内部矛盾爆发，就立刻开始杀人，这就相当于宣布自己提前下台，跟人没死把神主牌位供上属于一个性质。</p>

<h3 id="1982-关于中国城市土著人口的一些疑问-submitted-on-2023-01-18-2132020800">1982: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/10f7h8e/关于中国城市土著人口的一些疑问/">关于中国城市土著人口的一些疑问</a>, submitted on 2023-01-18 21:32:02+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>1982.1</strong> —–2023-01-18 23:17:52+08:00:</p>

<p>1.我认为留存率不高，大部分城市人口追溯三四代，都可能是农民出身。因为上个世纪初城市建设不发达，很难供养大量的人口聚集生活，最发达的大城市也不能跟现在比，全国城市人口加在一起，清末北京人口我查是76万，满人占一大半。</p>

<p>满人因素也是个很重要的情况，第一是因为清朝的缘故，为满人在很多城市建设了新城，也即是一些满城，用于政治上的驻防避免汉人反叛和安置嫡系人口在关键地区。</p>

<p>但是清末占据主要城市人口不小比例的满人都破败了，几乎都逃离了原来的居住地。</p>

<p>而且古代讲究一个嫡传，除非一直是嫡传子弟，否则追溯到一定程度，会发现因为分家，家里哪怕祖上都是城市人口，但到了一定时期就莫名其妙变农民了，所以个人家族我认为大不到哪去，基本穿三代还有紧密联系就算很不错了。</p>

<p>2.大部分地区在城市生活的人口肯定都高度洗牌过，太平天国和捻军、湘军的战争，不但大量人口死亡，围绕城市展开战斗，还征召大量的士兵背井离乡。</p>

<p>这就导致人口流动性极大，闯关东持续多年，尤其是辛亥革命后，国内经历抗日战争、国共战争、知青下乡等事件。</p>

<p>这些对城市人口追溯的影响太大了，尤其是农村人口到城市，很多人不识字或者不特地去记录，脱离族谱就不知道家族出身，长江以北的人口更替程度程度很大，岭南保存相对完整。</p>

<p>零星的是可以追溯到宋明，但是主要是来自于农村聚居的大族，也有部分是口传在南北朝到隋唐的，虽然测DNA有方向可能是真的，不过大部分文献记录都待查，这些也都是农村的。</p>

<p>我国古代有个不好的地方，就是每次朝代更替，地面建筑都会遭受大规模破坏，不考虑地质灾害和下沉问题，许多地面建筑都无法留存，以至于现在木制建筑只到唐代南禅寺，实际上唐代就很少了，五代十国到宋代建筑也是比较稀少，明清相对较多。</p>

<p>部分汉阙也有残留，但完整的少，这些都代表了城市每次变迁遭遇的冲击。因此实际城市人口传承，我认为到明清就很难得了，大部分传承多的都是在农村为主，满清入关后的屠杀和抢占资源其实反而逼迫大量的人口外逃，扬州十日就是跑都跑不了的例子。</p>

<p>3.有一部分是出国了，这个出国的包括卖身出去的底层，以及中共内战胜利前后就已经有能力出国的中产阶级，留下的相当多都被干碎了，活下来没死的，往往后代会被并入劳动职工，或者发配出去到农村，知青下乡其实有一批人就是这群城市人口的后代。</p>

<p>看了很多纪录片，发现这群人的后代实际没有回城市，而是选择留在了农村，你要是去农村早些年，可以看到一些谈吐不一样，穿着虽然土但是得体的长者，尤其是喜欢穿羊毛衫，这是当年的一个城市体面的衣服，这种人大概率就是被下放过来的。</p>

<p>实际上这就导致了他们的阶级下滑，因为现代就是农村不如城市，户籍制度锁死人的出身，但也是无可奈何。</p>

<p>上海北京的人口保留是相对较好的，但实际也很分人，我知道有一部分北京上海从清末的土著人口迟到了城市发展红利，成为中产阶级，但也的确可以看得到一些同样土著出身，发展并不算好，我没法确定两者比例。</p>

<p>而清朝时期就发达的中产阶级和贵族后代，嫡系和有能力的支系大部分后来都的确是出了国，少部分留学有能力后回来加入中共当了干部，有些知名科学家或者文艺界人士，你细察往上可以发现他们祖上是清末到民国比较有身份的人，还有一些人的后代就永久性移民到了国外。</p>

<p>这个现象我查很多名人的后代时都有发现，很多人的后代彻底离开了中国。</p>

<p>吃到城市发展红利的土著有两种，一种是阶级提高后有足够收入打点自己房子，一些北京胡同、上海小洋楼的主人，很可能就是这些人的后代，尤其是你在网上找得到的那些超贵民宿。</p>

<p>还有另外一种，就是前面没吃到红利，仍然是普通阶层，居住在狭小空间和胡同里，生活条件谈不上好。</p>

<p>北京市辖区人口1953年才277万，对比1911年约80万的数据显得明显增长不足，到61年总人口721万，市辖区非农业人口才397万，文革时期1970年总人口771万，市辖区非农业人口一度下跌到366万，但是包括下级辖区的总人口增长了50万。</p>

<p>平均每年人口算郊区农民、没被波及的平民总共年增长才5万多，刚好那几年是扩大知青生产建设兵团的时候。</p>

<p>所以很多北京人最终是没有回到故乡的，这里还不包括一些从城市调走去援建各地的技术人员，尤其是东北到各地援建，因为那时候东北是重工业基地，援建各地的情况很多。</p>

<p>毛泽东死去的1976年，北京的市辖区非农业人口才393万，比15年前的1961年（397万）还少了4万人。</p>

<p>反而是改革开发后，在1978年，非农业人口迅速突破400万，到了409万，但是市辖区人口也在快速增长，所以我认为这个时候是农民进城导致的，发配出去的人口回流有限，市辖区的非农业人口每年增速约10万上下，农业与其他产业人口大体维持在比非农业城市人口多六七十万。</p>

<p>有一部分非农业人口快速增长的原因，我认为跟当时开放高考后，全国大学生涌入有关，再加上贸易活动增加，也吸引了不同城市的人口进入，所以1960年732万人的北京到1973年算下辖的行政区与郊区人口才806万，而改革开放后在1987年左右就达到了1000万人，下一个增长期就是九十年代中期到两千年后了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1989.1</strong> —–2023-01-21 01:25:03+08:00:</p>

<p>我觉得有两个原因</p>

<p>第一，老龄化是个战后才开始愈发明显的社会现象，人类文明没有充足的生产力和政策去应对，浪潮基本要一两个世纪才可能累积到足够经验。</p>

<p>现在存在的国家里，也没有几个是事先五十年就有应对机制的。</p>

<p>第二，养老金制度本身就是一种从过去社会，由多数人供养少数人的制度。</p>

<p>古代在特定领域也有养老金，但转嫁成本往往靠奴隶、农奴为主，供养对象也局限在士兵之类，因此生产力的农业社会，能很小范围保持住。</p>

<p>到了近代，养老金则可能体现在国家政策，比如退休老兵、伤残老兵。</p>

<p>德国的养老金计划涵盖范围也是有限的，美国在十九世纪也只能局限在少数职业如消防员、教师和警察，公共部门为主。</p>

<p>随着生产力带来的社会结构变化，社会的受教育水平和道德提高，越来越多公民个体需要养老金，对个人的生活指标和未来有所预期，因此退休后的收入成为必要产物。</p>

<p>这就打破了过去社会大多数供养少数人形成平衡的结构。</p>

<p>我认为要解决这种问题，靠拉高人口已经不可能实现，而是应该拉高消费比例。</p>

<p>因为就算一些发达国家进入养老及困局，也同时会面临招工困难，尤其是基层劳动岗位，活多钱少，他们却占据消费的大头。</p>

<p>社会的经济循环，本质有两个关键输入，外源性的就是原材料，物资不可以缺乏。</p>

<p>内源性的就是经济内需的价值，也即创造消费需求，有需求了原材料才具备价值，但是创造需求非常困难。</p>

<p>所以我认为未来解决养老金困境，就是要制造全民消费，政府要大幅度提高福利待遇。</p>

<p>发放全民基本收入，用来替代养老金，当然这是有技术前提的，也即基层岗位存在部分机器取代，并且中上部分的劳动力稀缺，允许原本基层劳动力，可以在基本收入之外，再去获取更多的收入。</p>

<p>人人都有钱，在基本生存资源如房子得到保障后，重新投入市场来刺激消费，从而可以实现政府到企业的收支无限循环。</p>

<p>从人们消费的意愿可以看出来，不愿意消费往往是因为经济和收入前景不明朗，导致必须积蓄，企业就赚不到这笔钱，政府也拿不到税收发不出福利，但是银行拿到这些钱的投资收益却往往受益对象有限。</p>

<p>因此一个能保障基本收入去允许民众消费50%到70%生活必需品的基本收入制度，可以大大商品的消费数量，而额外的收入来源则决定了更高水平的物质需求。</p>

<p>也即是说，政府的收支从企业→年轻人→养老金（政府）→老人→企业。</p>

<p>变成了基本收入（养老金、政府）→老人、年轻人→企业→政府，实际上效率更高，并且伴随无人化的设备推广，无论如何基层都会出现一部分失业，完全过渡到生产力允许基本收入前又有一个时间需要等待，可能是五十年到六七十年。</p>

<p>建筑质量可能反而是其次，主要体现的问题是，大型基建没有对应的财政能力去保养维护，很容易出现问题。</p>

<p>中共原本的如意算盘是利用对外输出基建去过剩产能，赚到基建的费用后，还给国内地方政府减负，不用一直进行债务滚雪球。</p>

<p>恰巧一带一路提出的那几年，是政府整理和约束地方债务的时间点，我认为两者是有关联的，一带一路上的一些冤大头国家充当了国内地方政府缓冲债务增速的血包。</p>

<p>而且有很多消息指出，一带一路项目往往要求从国内雇佣大量建筑工人、饮食，整个项目是高度一体化的，并不经常为当地带来就业与技术外流，反而这种跨国运输提高了成本。</p>

<p>尽管对外贷款项目的金额很高，但推动的收益是客观存在的，同样维护成本在国内这种环境都坚持不下去，在穷国小国无法维护也是预料之内。</p>

<p>从一带一路的项目，去看国内面临的基建压力，进而批判国内地方政府滥发债去滥造基建，留下一大堆问题的情况，更符能贴切社会实际需求。</p>

<p>—– <strong>336.1</strong> —–2023-01-18 00:38:24+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Oona Hathaway:</strong> “As the conflict in Ukraine is about to enter its second year, Ukraine and the West are accelerating efforts to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t get away with his illegal war. That has meant the West supplying weapons that were previously off the table, but it has also meant renewed attention to accountability. In November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made clear that justice is a key condition for peace. “This,” he explained, “is what stokes the greatest emotions.” But while there are courts where Russians can be prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, a major piece is missing: there is nowhere to try Putin and other top Russian leaders for launching the war in the first place. For this, a special tribunal for the crime of aggression is needed.</p>

<p>For months, Ukrainian representatives have been quietly working to generate support for a special tribunal. The proposal picked up steam in mid-December, when the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, endorsed the creation of a tribunal and pledged to “start working with the international community to get the broadest international support possible for this specialized court.” In mid-December, while accepting the European Union’s top human rights award, Zelensky called on states to form a special tribunal to prosecute “the crime of Russian aggression.” At the same time, a Ukrainian delegation, hoping to capitalize on the momentum, arrived in Washington, D.C., seeking U.S. support for a special tribunal.</p>

<p>The effort to establish a special tribunal may seem quixotic. After all, plenty of criminal investigations into crimes committed by Russians during the war are already underway in both domestic and international courts. Why add another court to the mix? But without a special tribunal for the crime of aggression, the fundamental crime of launching and waging this illegal war—a crime without which the other crimes would not have taken place—would go entirely unpunished. Creating a court that has jurisdiction to try this crime is an essential step in the global effort to reject Russia’s blatantly illegal war and, with it, Putin’s willingness to destroy the modern international legal order in pursuit of a new Russian empire.”</p>

<p>Putin’s effort to restore Russia’s lost empire is destined to fail. The moment is therefore ripe for a transition to democracy and a devolution of power to the regional levels. But for such a political transformation to take place, Putin must be defeated militarily in Ukraine. A decisive loss on the battlefield would pierce Putin’s aura of invincibility and expose him as the architect of a failing state, making his regime vulnerable to challenge from within.<br />
The West, and above all the United States, is capable of providing the military and financial support to hasten the inevitable and propel Ukraine to a speedy victory. But the Biden administration still hasn’t coalesced around a clear endgame for the war, and some U.S. officials have suggested that Kyiv should consider giving up part of its territory in pursuit of peace—suggestions that are not reassuring. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made it clear that the Ukrainian people will never accept such a deal. Any territorial concessions made to Putin will inevitably lead to another war down the road.<br />
At the root of Washington’s unwillingness to supply the necessary weapons lies a fear of the potential consequences of decisively defeating Russia in Ukraine. Many in the Biden administration believe that Putin’s downfall could trigger the collapse of Russia, plunging the nuclear-armed state into chaos and potentially strengthening China. But such fears are overstated.</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Will Freeman, Ph.D. candidate in Politics at Princeton University and a 2022 Fulbright-Hays Scholar in Colombia, Guatemala, and Peru]</p>

<p>Peru’s troubles go deeper than the conflict over the election calendar. Even if the president and the entire Congress resigned tomorrow, democratic erosion would likely persist. That is because Peru is afflicted by a more serious issue: the weaponization of checks and balances by both branches of government. It is too easy for Congress to impeach the president and for the president to shut down Congress. Until reforms prevent the president and Congress from abusing their powers to rein in each other, Peru will continue to spiral.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2023-01-09~2023-01-15的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-15/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2023-01-09~2023-01-15的言论" /><published>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-15/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-15/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>在这个过程里产生的一系列操作，遭到国际秩序的排斥，根本目的是零和游戏心态的称霸，主人与奴才的思维作怪，只有他没能力管和看不到的，没有他不想掌控的，就像我们看金正恩一样，金正恩想不想统治中国，他肯定想，但没这个能力，所以动辄行为怪异夸张，但其实都是维护自身王朝统治的正常操作，或者局限在小范围内认为理所当然的反应。</p>

<p>中国社会与中华民族与美国没有核心矛盾，我们越像他们一样生活，经济越发达靠近他们，近似的地方就越多，最终我们都会成为“现代人”，说白了生产和劳作模式一样，都是人，最后会产生的东西总归是近似的，文化不同可以带来部分差异，但不改变现代文明的内核。</p>

<p>胡赵水平不行的话，中国一百五十多年来就没有水平可以的人了，</p>

<p>尤其是赵紫阳，在行政工作，特别是经济水平上是近代第一人，没有之一，执政记录和细节非常健全可考，放眼过去和现在没有任何一个人能追得上。</p>

<p>他可以直接跟邹至庄和米尔顿弗里德曼师徒对谈交流经济看法，前者是非常知名的华人经济学家，后者是诺贝尔奖得主和货币主义的提出者，邹至庄认为赵紫阳这样行政出身能吃透经济学的官僚，即便欧美也很少见。</p>

<p>国内经济学的顶流周其仁，年轻时跟赵紫阳对谈，被问到说不出话，包括推动中国现代改革方向的莫干山会议，以及政府体系的第三梯队建立、农研、体改所，都是胡赵一手抓起来的。</p>

<p>江泽民既没有改革党，也没有改革社会，没为公平社会与胡温时期执政做铺垫，几乎就是在野蛮生长期里错过了一系列改革的最佳时机，相反推行了一些埋下社会与政权长期隐患的问题。</p>

<p>无法控制李鹏，直接导致李鹏带来大量的债务雪球和政府坏账。</p>

<p>赵紫阳对中国社会的判断，是认为如果按照他制定的框架走下去，必须要走向一个公平和公开化的社会环境，如果不能提前为此做准备，社会将在中共下台后处于大规模混乱。</p>

<p>在野蛮生长的快速发展期，批邓的观点不算特别流行，但是随着发展期结束的现代，互联网上就出现了普遍的网左，对邓的稻上飞叫法也十分普遍。</p>

<p>也着实出现了赵预判的“不动改革成果的前提下，怀念毛时代所谓的廉洁、清明、公平”的潮流。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.3</strong> —–2023-01-14 21:47:17+08:00:</p>

<p>吃水不忘挖井人，不能不搞清楚事实与否就下结论。</p>

<p>这些属于经典的对现代中国历史缺乏认知的一个想当然观点，我统一回答下，你要是有疑问想了解可以继续问，毕竟墙内不许讨论，所以我默认你是不清楚才这样认为，不知者不罪，而不是立场上的问题。</p>

<p>很多人因为国内完全不教这方面，也没这些相关信息，容易陷入盲区，忽略了到底是谁设计和执行中国经济与社会框架，当政者又与这些人有什么关系。</p>

<p>首先中国的经济框架是赵紫阳带头主导设计的，一直沿用到现在，包括在计划经济时代，在地方带头行政推行改革开发，是他跟万里最先做出实际成绩。</p>

<p>而现代中国采用的各类经济政策，也是依照八十年代赵紫阳订立的方向，从来没有跳出锅他划好的框架。</p>

<p>比如WTO，实际是赵紫阳当年在陈云等老一代负责经济的人还没意识到的情况下，80年华国锋还没完全失势时，顶着国内左派压力，推动中国加入WTO前身关贸总协定才有的结果，国内还没准备好对外开放，赵已经在为对接外部世界做准备了。</p>

<p>分税制没有帮助任何人扛过金融危机，它只是一种为中央集权和确立财权地位的制度方案，如果你说的是九十年代的银行坏账潮和债务雪球，主要是因为李鹏滥发债导致。</p>

<p>赵紫阳主政时期是坚持限制债务，不滥用债务，减少货币发行，更靠拢货币主义。</p>

<p>李鹏上台后的滥发债务，对经济一窍不通，直接导致大量政府资产贬值，本来需要用较长周期完成的去国企过剩产能化的做法，直接因为财困被一刀切，导致了大下岗和东北萧条。</p>

<p>尤其是商品价格问题，赵紫阳接手的是一个没有市场经济，毛泽东时期货币滥发，对外毫无竞争力的国家。</p>

<p>十年左右的改革，就在双轨制还没彻底并轨前，顶着党内极其庞大的左派保守势力，提供了市场经济的基础，并且带来了高速经济增长，活化了一潭死水的社会经济。</p>

<p>大企业问题，比如现在的腾讯等垄断企业，就是基于江泽民时期的官僚资本主义为基础发展而来的一种产物，赵紫阳则恰恰相反，强调公平社会，尤其是推动工会发展已经有了初步框架，集中重点在扶持中小企和劳工待遇。</p>

<p>腐败问题本质是权力监督不足和滥权导致，分权由更广大的基层向上逐级监督，是减少腐败的最好方法。</p>

<p>包括资本主义观念上也是，赵紫阳是实用主义者，并无固定的政治立场非执行不可。</p>

<p>社会主义市场经济实质性是政治上邓小平解释制度改变的产物，而非江泽民，执行和规划则是赵紫阳的产物，这东西既然不是江泽民负责，也不是他管理，经济工作历来是国务院总理的事，江泽民主要负责的党务。</p>

<p>中国实质性是一个资本主义的国家，无关官方怎么诠释，这都是绝对事实，这是一种理性的先验制度，是不需要人刻意使用各种资源和力量去制造维系，社会就会有自发性诞生与组成的一种天然产物。</p>

<p>这也是为什么依赖暴力和资源垄断维持的计划经济全世界无一例外，到最后都无法执行下去的原因。</p>

<p>赵紫阳的预判是，未来如果不监督和限制权力，社会会走向官僚资本主义，而不培育反对党，一旦中共下台，就会陷入社会大规模混乱。</p>

<p>目前情况是，中共没有自我纠错能力，邓小平死后，党内改革力量开始愈发难以发挥，只是在老改革派党内人士护航，以及保守派妥协下，才有今天的局面。</p>

<p>但保守派对经济的破坏，比如土地财政的滥用、分税制下使用户籍制度制造商品供应的人为稀缺性，扶持大公司垄断，打压工会与劳工权益，尤其是996这种模式，再到血汗工厂，以及滥发债务透支未来中国的经济活力，都可以看得出赵紫阳的判断是完全正确的。</p>

<p>并且邓死后，党内红二三代陆续上台，最终出现了完全无法被制衡的一家独大势力，而也正是邓本人自己破坏了这种平衡，妄想依靠胡温这样被改造的改革派作为制衡，最后被陈云路线夺舍。</p>

<p>基本上，缺乏现实感，不肯针对现实事件就事论事的冷静讨论的人，观点连流通都做不到，因为往左往右，往前往后，这是基本逻辑事实问题，而不是对错问题，如果不能讨论、认识到问题本身，自然没有任何解决办法，没解决办法就不能吸引被现实问题影响到希望得到帮助和解决问题的人的支持。</p>

<p>这也是为什么毛左死绝，跟清廷复辟爱好者一样，被扫入历史垃圾堆里喊破天也没任何翻身机会的原因，因为他们连基本现实问题都不愿意判断，所以无论互联网还是现实都是毫无威胁的病友群体而已，连很多魔怔网左都瞧不起他们可见一斑。</p>

<p>所以，就事论事是做人的基本生存能力，否则说什么做什么都没说服力。</p>

<p>相比之下，很多网左起码是认识到客观规律是不可避免的，只是在这个客观规律下找缝隙生存，更有甚进步者，是基于客观的市场规律，去重新解释左倾社会所需的特质，而不是刻舟求剑的还原左翼圣经，跟追寻先知字句一样去硬搬。</p>

<p>当然，本质上左右只要是方法论，而不是立场论，就没有矛盾，只是不同时期社会发展的需求倾斜方向不同。</p>

<p>【 笑，按照你的标准，说得好像赵能控制住李鹏一样。赵能控制住，就不会来来回回说李鹏搞乱了六四了。 】</p>

<p>赵紫阳当总书记时，经济权力是抓在手里的，李鹏只是名义国务院总理，经济实权仍然在赵的改革派手里，但即便如此保守派依然控制大量的地方企业和行政跟中央推行的国企改革作对，最后导致双轨制并轨不理想。</p>

<p>最搞笑的地方在于什么，我谈的是经济权力，也就是债务问题，但你能歪到政治问题上，是个人都知道邓小平才有最高权力，赵紫阳本来就无法从政治上控制李鹏，他控制的本来就是李鹏不懂经济对改革开放的负面影响，这里就可以看得出你压根没有逻辑。</p>

<p>【 领导人啊，要看有没有野心，有没有威望，正因为毛、邓有和苏美平视的气度，才能做稳一把手的位置。正因为江也有类似的气魄，才能够和华莱士、克林顿谈笑风生。中国的目标始终是重回世界老大，赵这种软骨头，哪里有意志跟美帝竞争啊，直接滑跪了。所以说和江差了几个Level啊。 】</p>

<p>软骨头：</p>

<p>指毛泽东高呼蒋委员长万岁，要早打大打打核战争，儿子变挂炉烤鸭，晚年乒乓外交又开始跟美国人交往起来。</p>

<p>指邓小平说“我保证永不翻案，绝不愿做一个死不悔改的走资派。我的最大希望是能够留在党内，请求党在可能的时候分配我一个小小的工作，给我以补过从新的机会。”</p>

<p>然后转头就平反文革，放弃计划经济，拥抱市场经济，硬骨头也不喜欢计划经济是吧。</p>

<p>指江泽民要跑到苏联去签署协议，赵紫阳时期是戈尔巴乔夫要亲自到中国来谈这个问题，有利于中方的条件，到江泽民时期就放弃大面积的土地，然后江泽民一开始不积极推动改革开放，偏向陈云，邓小平南巡后立刻表态支持的硬骨头是吧？</p>

<p>指赵紫阳宁肯放弃总书记和接班人地位，也坚决不同意镇压，指赵紫阳坚持不做党内检讨，最后党内挑不出毛病，无法对他定罪，想给他安排的罪名也不了了之，只能软禁。指赵紫阳冒着被开除党籍和被杀的风险，在毛泽东还没死的时候，顶着四人帮点名批判在地方活化经济，为你现在能当键盘侠指点江山提供经济基础。</p>

<p>中共建党101年，只有两个总书记没做违心的检讨，一个叫陈独秀，一个叫赵紫阳。</p>

<p>中共保守派高层那么厉害有威望，为什么不敢把赵紫阳抓起来到电视台跟薄熙来一样公审？那么有气度，怎么连软禁都不敢公开明文批示，也不敢开除赵紫阳党籍。</p>

<p>一个失势的总书记，挑不出毛病来，保守派还是政治死敌呢，头一次见到失势政敌不下狱不开除不给批示不公开说软禁，纸面说一切行动自由的情况下跟爹一样供起来。</p>

<p>江泽民跟华莱士谈笑风生还有怯场转移话题的时候，那我寻思赵紫阳不懂英文，去美国跟里根谈笑风生，在白宫酒会致辞，在国内脱稿接待记者不知道江泽民又差几个Level。</p>

<p>原本我没对比都懒得说，江泽民时期接见个香港记者就破防，被人记录下来现在一群人都忘了这是多么羞耻的一件事，玩梗还以为多体面呢。</p>

<p>孰不知赵紫阳84年接见国内外记者，全程脱稿讲话都是基本的，现在习近平还要来个“我看看这个小本子上有没有”，没人要求领导人必须脱稿讲话，有稿子很正常，但能力从江泽民时期就开始退化，还当成美事了。</p>

<p>胡耀邦被陆铿采访，因为陆铿没听他的做处理，把一些不适宜的话放了出来，出事了胡耀邦被批判，还不忘记给陆铿开脱呢，更别提根本就不怕尖锐议题，有什么都是兵来将挡水来土掩。</p>

<p>改革开放也是政治改革，放权简政，做错了吗？没有，而且很成功。w</p>

<p>【 总之啊，你的理论水平啊，实在太差，我跟你交流起来就像是一个大学生教小学生高数，太累了。我给你只条道吧，网上搜搜习近平的《对发展社会主义市场经济的再认识》，好好学习一下，也不至于说出『中国实质性是一个资本主义的国家』，『社会主义市场经济是赵搞得，和江没关系』这种让人笑掉大牙的话。 】</p>

<p>就像你前面说“江的社会主义市场经济”，你稍微动手查一下都能知道。</p>

<p>现代在中共政治语境力的社会主义市场经济，是来自于赵紫阳主政四川时期，成都会议力不同人士提出的议题。</p>

<p>也即《试论社会主义计划经济同市场经济结合的问题》，赵紫阳收到会议记录后，鼓励在全省推行，类似模式诞生了后来的无锡会议。</p>

<p>江泽民时期只是写入宪法，七十年代末赵紫阳偷偷私下改变农业生产模式，再到79年给程度会议提出的社会主义市场经济背书和肯定时，江泽民才刚开始在党内有起色，大概率还经常随团飘在国外呢。</p>

<p>最搞笑的是，马洪问赵紫阳： “咱们一直说搞社会主义商品经济，商品经济和市场经济是什么关系？”</p>

<p>赵紫阳回答，“就是一回事，只不过是有人不太能接受市场经济这个说法，现在只好绕个弯子提商品经济。</p>

<p>赵紫阳不但是搞起来社会主义市场经济理论和命名法的人，还是最早为该观念背书的官僚，话语权和解释权都在这，他怎么解释的？</p>

<p>难道你还想跳出来说赵紫阳这些人都是走资派？难道你想回到计划经济时代，否定市场经济？你敢吗？有这个胆子吗？公开在国内说说，别人都笑话你而已，所以想来也没有胆子，更别提在互联网承认了，只会被人耻笑而已。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.18</strong> —–2023-01-16 16:31:05+08:00:</p>

<p>赵紫阳当时跑很多发达国家，大体上确定了一个劳动密集型产业的国家转型所需的铺垫。</p>

<p>并且结合了国内的特殊情况做理解给出了具体方向，全面的东西太复杂，我挑核心的地方讲。</p>

<p>首先，赵紫阳认为要承认一个基本事实，中共不可能永远执政，要接受中共可能下台的客观历史规律，没有任何政党是永久执政的，堵不如疏。</p>

<p>一旦中共的经济改革到头，而没有政治改革和铺垫缓冲，出现中共瞬间横死，又没有反对党接盘，社会将陷入大规模混乱，改革开放的经济成果也可能付之东流。</p>

<p>基于这一点，培育反对派，首先是党内的，然后慢慢拓展到其他民间团体，给其他民主党派职务去协调中共工作，给民间批判的权力，但早期不让两者过于紧密结合，仍然以中共为核心主导去有序改革，而不是允许民间随便批评。</p>

<p>然后简政放权，进行收入分配改革，推动公共服务进步，这个要参考经济进化的规则。</p>

<p>发展中国家往发达国家转型时，一个重要指标就是内需消费在经济力的占比与质量，这意味着形成内部的循环，也是当下习近平政府最迫切但又解决不了的。</p>

<p>原因很简单，产业升级意味着对企业放权，对知识分子和中产阶级的社会话语权让渡。</p>

<p>内需消费要建立在消费能力以及产业升级的基础上，而消费能力必须是民众有闲钱，有时间，无后顾之忧才能投入大量收入到购买商品，从而保证一个国家内源性的经济活力。</p>

<p>因此政府需要建立一个有工会，能保证劳工待遇，有健全且相对独立的司法体系，不受行政和政治干预的清明环境。</p>

<p>只有劳工待遇和福利被保障，才能形成消费基础，同时应该避免土地财政作为地方政府的收入单一来源。</p>

<p>现代的中共基本国策，是分税制下， 优秀税种中央控制，来保证中央对地方的财政压制，避免有人做大不服管。</p>

<p>但分税制，意味着优秀税源给了中央，而地方就会陷入事多钱少的局面，缺钱就要有资金，土地这种收不上来的不动产，成了中央放开给地方的一种变现手段。</p>

<p>而土地本身不难变现，需要建造经营，这又带动债务经济的加速发展，地方政府大量举债去建造各种无效基建，过剩饱和下留下大量的资源浪费，并且形成债务付息问题，利息侵占本来就不多的公共服务财政。</p>

<p>没有足够税源还利息，意味着要靠土地财政才能维持基本的基层政府运作和公共福利。</p>

<p>然而土地财政本身就在不断价高经商和生活成本，五十万租金的店铺，无论仓储还是售卖货品，都形成了价格红线，导致经商不考虑政府行政干预过多，单纯因土地问题也无法有效发展，租金成本永远要命。</p>

<p>更要命的事，住房是刚需，刚需意味着肯定要买，很多人组建家庭没房是不可能的事。</p>

<p>土地财政直接导致民众要把大量收入和未来收入用于购房还债，也就自然没钱去消费，中小企业也就无法为消费升级和内需社会的建设做贡献。</p>

<p>户籍制度太长了这里放在一起谈。</p>

<p>总的来说，赵紫阳的观念是，在分配问题出现前，就先去处理分配问题本身，为劳工高待遇打基础，给地方减负避免他们为了财政和行政命令而违背事实需求。</p>

<p>也就是说，土地财政可以搞，但不会因为中央政绩而乱来，有多少的钱做多少事，而不是有多少事去想办法搞多少钱，这是简政放权的根本逻辑，同时附带地方监督机构的实权化，来解决财政监督问题。</p>

<p>中央在大方向上给意见，具体执行细节地方自己安排，给农民和地方人口更高的流动性，而不是靠户籍把人锁死，制造公共福利与社会待遇落差来逼迫农民进城承当廉价劳动力的角色，赵紫阳认为中国农民的富强，可以直接决定中国的社会与经济面貌。</p>

<p>中国现在的问题，在于劳工待遇不足，中小企营商成本高，地方财政监督几乎没有，错误的财政机制，几乎所有人都在吃亏，只有最大的中央受益。</p>

<p>因为不愿意对社会其他阶层妥协让出权力，导致企业走向垄断化来方便控制，这种背景下工会和劳工权益更是无稽之谈了，更别提户籍制度下刻意制造的大量农民工与基层廉价劳动力，这样的社会人口构成，相较于高知分子为主的企业，血汗工厂模式更易于控制。</p>

<p>社会的形态被卡在这种情况下，如果继续发展，就无可避免要有所改变，这是赵紫阳预见的结果，也是中共高层不愿意面对的议题，失去权力。</p>

<p>要做的事本身不复杂，很简单，只是当局不愿意做，与他们利益是完全对立互相抵触的，做完他们失去权力，从建国开始的问题都要清算到他们家族头上，是身死族灭的事。</p>

<p>八十年代社会因为文革平反大和解，意识形态和老共产党人很多还在，因此社会矛盾的对立性小于当下，经济发展有潜力，社会向心力强。</p>

<p>如今官方没有任何意识形态的可取之处，纯粹就是靠拳头大和暴力来压制，也无法提供社会凝聚力，一旦对立起来就是彻头彻尾的敌我对立关系。</p>

<p>用更简单的话来讲，就是社会发展后，劳动人口越来越多，企业和产业越来越细，要管理的东西是数十倍的增长，一个良性社会运行，只能把消费和决策的权力下放到更小的节点力，否则就会出现效率和方向问题，就跟蒋介石打电话让排长挪动机枪几十米微操的梗一样了。</p>

<p>未来十年到十五年，实际就是反贼圈把源自于赵紫阳的观念和理论，逐渐按照实际情况进行理论化，然后实用化推广，将政治观念出口转内销的一个过程。</p>

<p>正因为赵紫阳的观念非常危险且有说服力，所以他才被边缘化和除忆最厉害，当社会产生需要时，会寻找一个旗帜符合大众利益与改革需求，所以当下重点其实就是把赵的观念普及简化。</p>

<p>别说我理解能力低，倒不如说你干货少，不愿意面对问题去跟我刚正面。</p>

<p>我明确说了现代中国是继续靠赵紫阳的政策和经济框架才能维持，而这个框架的发展是有上限的。</p>

<p>社会问题不可逆的在发展做大，政府没有任何解决问题的能力和打算。</p>

<p>全社会的矛盾正在愈发庞大，一旦地方政府财政濒临崩溃，这几十年的经济成果都将付之东流。</p>

<p>这次真是变外宾了是吧。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 这是因为邓和陈压着他。】</p>

<p>你但凡了解过赵紫阳，都知道赵紫阳对政治制度的改革思考，拓展到下个阶段，是他下台以后，九十年代到两千年代在家才思考出来的结果。</p>

<p>正是因为六四的问题才导致他进一步反思，在此之前赵紫阳对政治问题并不太关心，政治制度改革也只是为了配合经济发展，而配合经济发展这个思路到现在也没改变过。</p>

<p>前后时间和因果顺序颠倒了还有什么脸面再这搞不懂装懂。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【这三十年过去了，中国一样没走赵的路线，而是继续扩大了『社会主义市场经济』新路，离赵的想法越来越远。 】</p>

<p>首先，社会主义市场经济本身就是赵紫阳背书推广大一个产物。</p>

<p>其次，现代中国就是资本主义，而且还是国家资本主义、官僚资本主义，没有什么地方谈得上社会主义，更进一步来说，社会主义市场经济学，从意识形态上就与现代社会互相抵触。</p>

<p>官方嘴巴上不承认，它就不是资本主义了，学谁做鸵鸟呢。</p>

<p>全世界包括你内心，都很清楚现代就是一个纯粹的资本主义社会，官方的行政干预就是国家资本主义的表现，什么成分才不肯承认？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 你到底有没有理解能力里啊？？我从头到尾哪里否定过市场经济！！赵当然不是走资派，只不过是投降派！难道你想中国成为苏联那样，休克疗法后国家分裂，经济被寡头垄断？？？ 】</p>

<p>你但凡了解过苏联解体的过程和历史，都知道休克疗法是苏联解体后叶利钦才执行的。</p>

<p>而且失败的原因是因为卢布区成员国不愿意接受统一调度，导致俄罗斯无法控制货币供给，这些本身就是苏联自己留下的国企和计划经济引发的问题。</p>

<p>苏联怎么解体的？戈尔巴乔夫推行改革，然后导致党内保守派不满，进而发动政变夺权，但夺权以后又无法获得全国支持。</p>

<p>然后被叶利钦摘桃子宣布苏共停止运作，这才是苏联解体的实际过程。</p>

<p>逻辑就说反了，是现有戈尔巴乔夫改革，然后触发保守派不满，跟着导致苏共内斗，被叶利钦一网打尽，然后叶利钦解体苏联再利用休克疗法。</p>

<p>说白了，根本不是一个国家的组合体被强行揉在一起，长时间互相依赖又不得不分开才导致这种问题。</p>

<p>苏共保守派为什么不肯接受戈尔巴乔夫早期改革失败后，好不容易争取到的新苏联？</p>

<p>因为他们接受不了失去权力的未来，所以宁肯铤而走险毁灭苏共权威。</p>

<p>很多人把赵紫阳跟戈尔巴乔夫对比就是纯粹外行史盲，总是拿似是而非的东西对比。</p>

<p>戈尔巴乔夫改革失败，赵紫阳改革成功，这就是本质区别。</p>

<p>那请问投降什么？</p>

<p>你有没有能力说出，到底为什么投降派会导致国家分裂然后经济被寡头垄断？</p>

<p>任何提这种观点的人，脑子都是想当然，但你让他认真说，他说不出这个逻辑的前后关系和顺序。</p>

<p>不信你就看到这自己说，看看能不能说服自己，能说服自己你把文字打出来。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【经济被寡头垄断？？？】</p>

<p>这个我再单独批判一下</p>

<p>请问赵紫阳时期有没有经济寡头？</p>

<p>没有。</p>

<p>那么赵紫阳有没有提出反经济寡头和垄断的措施？</p>

<p>有，通过扶持工会与政府监督，并且继续提高政府透明度和被社会监督的职能。</p>

<p>向下放权，避免有人通过政府进行垄断、官商勾结与成为寡头。</p>

<p>那么现在有没有经济寡头？</p>

<p>有。</p>

<p>他们来自什么时期，成长背景又是怎么样的？</p>

<p>来自江泽民与李鹏在九十年代前后对国企一刀切的出手，导致大量国有资源外流。</p>

<p>或是来自两千年代利用政府的政商关系发展起来的超级企业。</p>

<p>以及来自国企的垄断，如政府高层子女和家族控制各种国有资源，而不需要承担企业成本，李鹏家族的电力、周永康的石油帮，都是出了名的。</p>

<p>本质又是什么？</p>

<p>本质是既然要控制权力、军队，还要控制经济的超级寡头。</p>

<p>就像俄罗斯最大的寡头就是普京一样，权力寡头。</p>

<p>中共有没有实质性解决问题，没有。这是大家都知道的事，你要当鸵鸟视而不见到什么时候。</p>

<p><strong>一个基本的判断，就是中共不是靠这套政治制度快要当你认为的所谓老二。</strong></p>

<p><strong>而是靠赵紫阳的经济制度才发展到今天，如果不用这种政治制度只会发展的更好，因为现有社会和经济问题都来自于这套制度的落后性，无法兼容匹配跟上社会发展。</strong></p>

<p><strong>相反，因为这套制度的落后性质，无法为现代化社会提供进一步的发展动力。</strong></p>

<p><strong>所以中共开始滥用社会资源，催高房价用于维护地方政府不破产，却不能带来有效管理。</strong></p>

<p><strong>一旦这种拆东墙补西墙的玩法到了一个极限，经济不能进一步增长，社会转型和产业升级也没完成，地方政府就会频繁进入破产潮。</strong></p>

<p>到时候就有可能陷入中央政令不出北京，地方无政府化，没有公共服务，反而有可能变成军阀混战，这下你满意了吧？</p>

<p>我不反对你有观点和立场。</p>

<p>大体分为70%、50%、30%这几个风险区域。</p>

<p>70%就开始说明有风险，50%就比较严重，30%意味着高度依赖财政转移或其他形势的输血。</p>

<p>2021年上半年全国有123个城市自给率不足50%，全年直辖市与省的自给率，只有9个是高于53%，其余的全部低于53%，新疆西藏、甘肃青海、黑龙江五个地区自给率低于30%。</p>

<p>我不知道你从哪个社区来，你就去NGA看看，粉红氛围原本算浓的地方，这几个月是不是到处都是阴阳怪气，看看反应的降低待遇存在不存在。</p>

<p>还有土地财政依赖度，去看看全国多畸形，北上广深，几乎都高于香港，部分主要城市是200%以上。</p>

<p>现在客观现实问题，谁最后会赢，都必须有现实感，粉红如果各个都如你一般，未来中共也不会有什么靠谱的支持者，毕竟你们也不会冒风险武装和上街支持中共。</p>

<p>【 我先立个Flag，中国GDP在2030年左右超过美国。你也不要拐弯抹角了，就说中国什么时候崩吧？今年，明年，还是后年？ 】</p>

<p>你还真别说，我这个人就是喜欢看政府数据。</p>

<p>2016年地方总开支160437亿，全国债务付息4991亿，占比3.11%。</p>

<p>2021年地方总开支211272亿，全国债务付息10456亿，占比4.94%。</p>

<p>2022年1-8月，地方总开支144014亿，全国债务付息7532亿，占比5.23%。</p>

<p>再看三组数据：</p>

<p>2016年地方总收入87195亿，全国债务付息4991亿，占比5.7%。</p>

<p>2021年地方总收入111077亿，全国债务付息10456亿，占比9.41%。</p>

<p>2022年1-8月地方总收入74427亿，全国债务付息占比7532亿，10.12%。</p>

<p>地方有大量政府是长期大幅度赤字运行，要依赖中央的转移支付，否则立刻崩盘，但问题在于，中央政府的转移支付，本质是征收地方的资金自行安排，不是财政部从虚空里掏出来的，是有限的。</p>

<p>而且可以看得出，债务付息占比，无论是开支占比还是收入占比，都在不断提高。</p>

<p>跟其他赤字开销提高本地经济、就业和维稳等支出不同，债务付息是无效开支，债务是高赤字下维持当下社会体制运行的根本，又不能停下。</p>

<p>当无效开支占比越来越高时，实际等于政府有一部分固定开支在不断增长，侵蚀政府财政安全，政府也是要还月供的，区别是这个月供会越来越高。</p>

<p>2021年1-8月债务付息是7028亿，到2022年同期是7532亿，增幅7.2%。</p>

<p>去年全年增幅是6.6%，今年可能在11135亿左右。</p>

<p>而去年的2021年，是债务付息首次突破1万亿大关，如果看全国好像是九牛一毛，但对地方来讲，无论收入还是赤字开支，都已经是个不小的数字。</p>

<p>假设每年增幅是6.5%，我算的不准但也推下，2023年可能是11858亿，2024年12628，2025年13448亿，2026年14322亿，2027年15252亿，2028年16243，2029年17298亿，2030年18422亿，2031年19619亿，2032年20894亿。</p>

<p>也就是说十年后，保守估计最少都要约2.1万亿的固定开支。</p>

<p>但是更多可能是12%到15%的动态增速。</p>

<p>基于今年可能的11135亿，推算下12%和15%两种情况，到10年后2032年的开支规模。</p>

<p>12%应该是34583亿，15%则应是45047亿，但是全国财政收入增长，根本追不上这个缺口，虽然明显不可能年均12%到15%的进行增长，可即便6.5%的增速，大多数时候也可以追平全国财政增长了。</p>

<p>然后在这个基础上，地方政府维稳和清零的额外开销又是一笔钱，社会是越来越动荡的，维稳开销的增长是没上限的（不单纯是控制社会，还有部分用于补贴不同阶层或产业）</p>

<p>而利息开销不讲情面，只会不断上涨，甚至维稳开销也要依赖债务，而不单纯是靠转移支付才能达到维稳目标。</p>

<p>然后我们知道，分税制下，地方是一个个独立城市形成的集体，不是一个完整的个体。</p>

<p>所谓地方，有的城市可能公务员开销都给不起，有的城市能一年十几万养闲人。</p>

<p>经济危机和产业升级不顺畅，包括房地产市场萎靡，最先影响的就是这些有钱的大城市。到时候就会出现许多地方都有破产风险。</p>

<p>过去中央抽钱做转移支付救边缘小城市，那么这时候只能专注大城市，避免出现这些地区的动荡。</p>

<p>那小城市怎么办？这个时候事实上可能官方就只靠军队威慑来形成对这种小地方的控制。</p>

<p>外包似地把当地管治权交给地方门阀和一些本地灰色集团。</p>

<p>文字资料上，有一个《从债务付息，看地方财政压力》上的做了不少陈述，有兴趣可以看看，不过我一般是直接看官方的财政部数据，因为问题一直都有，大家都意识到了，具体粗略看财政部数据就能读大方向。</p>

<p>官方实际最近一直在收紧获取利益的渠道，过去可能民六官四，现在逐渐缩到民四官六，未来民三官七也是可能的，而且我觉得他们最终目标是民二官八，通过国家资本主义，让所有人生产和消费最终利益都以高度提纯的形势被他们获取。</p>

<p>而运营风险则由劳动者与企业自行承担，你倒了就换个企业当白手套，发展卷到死的社会就业风气，让劳动者无所选择。（再用房贷控制）</p>

<p>利息增速是稳定的，但是财政增速不是。每个地方政府都可以大规模举债，但是不是每个地方政府都能稳定赚钱，到后面会出现你有权，也没有赚钱变现去堵窟窿的渠道，这也是许多小地方政府会遭遇破产潮的原因。（多少一到三线城市病态依赖土地财政，有数据，这里太长我不赘述了。）</p>

<p>国内对政府破产换了个说法，叫财政重整，政治意味大于实际，避免动摇信心。六年前提出这个说法时，就说明中央政府高层是极其清楚未来要发生什么的，但很多人没明白他们知道什么，搞不清这点，信息差下就无法理解中共政府这几年的各种操作，实际人家危机感早就爆棚还做多手准备了。</p>

<p>鹤岗现在破产，之后会有大量的县和十八线城市接连破产，中共的财政安排和敛财手段，可能会拖延破产潮的到来，但不会改变。（羊毛出在羊身上，拖越久，全国人民越像葛优，不是党国不愿意换一个，而是没有其他羊了）</p>

<p>如果加速，十年内看到也不是没可能，至少目前一切恶化状况都比我前几年预测来的要快很多。破产潮什么时候来不清楚，但二十年内百分百出现，我们可能已经在破产潮带来的一个历史拐点里，只是现在还没意识到，后知后觉，在未来历史教科书上可能才会反应过来，恍然大悟原来这个时候中共就已经不行了。</p>

<p>地方一般债还债 1.55万亿</p>

<p>地方专项债还债 1.15万亿</p>

<p>现在发行期限，一般债是平均8年左右，专项债务是平均15年到13年</p>

<p>也就是说，虽然这么粗暴算不科学，但中共财政至少有两个坎要过去，一个是十年后，最近几年债务增速和、利息增长和公共开销超额的部分，加上疫情带来的过量增长。</p>

<p>中共目前已经做了应对手段，改税制是其中一个目前已经具体的，尤其是直接税体制建立。</p>

<p>然后第二轮的专项债，在2035到2037年有一轮还债潮，我不认为到时候政府财政还能从各种危机下完好无损保护每个环节，无论大小，一定会出现漏洞。</p>

<p>而且中途不断增长的债务利息，会跟维稳经费之间竞争有限的财政增长。</p>

<p>因为是平均的年限，所以有的可能是20到30年的，有的是7-10年浮动，大体上每年都要还债，现在压力还不算大，但未来不好说。</p>

<p>债务限额，可以理解为官方对未来一段时间，能获取收益的控制范围。</p>

<p>但是这个东西说科学也科学，说不科学也不科学，因为遇到突发事件和刚需，地方只能靠发债来保证政治目标和执行政策，你不把债务配额推高，也解决不了问题。</p>

<p>所以不排除以后出现一个奇景，就是某省份一年只能给一万亿发债限额，地方政府把限额几乎用了，然后解决不了问题（这个情况应该已经出现了，有很多省份逼近吃满）</p>

<p>如果债务限额100%，使用率到90%或者110%，可能地方政府对社会控制都还好，可以拆东墙补西墙，欺负一些公务员。</p>

<p>可到了130%甚至150%，那离死不远了。（当然，纸面数据不可能反馈出来，只会出现债务限额暴增。）</p>

<p>我是跟你讲道理，但你没这个水平讲道理，也不愿意讲，是因为你支持的东西本身就是虚假站不住脚的，只有你自己愿意信，这也是为什么你们这样的人离开墙内禁言堵嘴的环境，根本成不了气候。</p>

<p>就比如说你嘴硬的这里：【『投降派』啊，被人民遗弃了，不反思自己错在哪里了，到处怨这怨那。】</p>

<p>六四政变杀完平民，政变以后不让人说话，靠暴力和堵嘴来避免讨论问题，这不就是典型墙内互联网那一套操作么。</p>

<p>你可以说你认为的观点，但是拉偏架不许别人说，本质就是心虚。</p>

<p>然后你自己莫名其妙再包装一下，说成被人民遗弃了，遗弃了怎么去年人民群众又在全国各地上街了。</p>

<p>我都不用说别的，就国内敢不敢放开了让讨论，互联网不设政治限制让人说话。</p>

<p>动不动还弄个冲塔，那说明什么？说真话是有风险的。</p>

<p>这就是讲道理的事实，可以把你这样的老套话术捶死，人类社会要正常运作，总归是讲道理的人居多，而不是你这样只有自己相信的话术能成为主流。</p>

<p>【 这才25年，还早着呢，我觉得吧，你有生之年是看不到投降派掌权了，我提前替你遗憾了。笑。 】</p>

<p>这里有两点我感觉很有意思</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>第一</p>

<p>那我觉得你对我有一个误会了，我没兴趣看到你嘴里的投降派掌权。</p>

<p>然后你还说我是【 一窍不通的本Sub宠物】，那你应该很了解我立场和观点才对啊。</p>

<p>这样是不是可以判断出一件事，你不知道从哪了解到我，然后意识到我好像有人认识，你也认可这点了，但是你对我是全面否定。</p>

<p>既然要全面否定，肯定是了解我的对吧，但按理了解我却不知道我在想什么，我的观点是什么，你怎么去对付我呢？单方面嘴巴发泄有什么用。</p>

<p>从你这个反应里可以逆推出你的判断和执行能力在什么位置。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>第二</p>

<p>我觉得你这句话说的反而很符合当下：【还早着呢】</p>

<p>真就是还早着呢，你还年轻，我也年轻，大家在这个世纪活个七八十岁不是问题。</p>

<p>这才是最让我开心的地方，所以我都是劝粉红，一定要想办法多活一些年头，我从来都是反对喊打喊杀的对立，就是劝人安居乐业，活下去才能看到更多有趣的事。</p>

<p>假设一个人25岁，50年后是75岁，那50年前社会是什么样？1973年文革还没结束呢。</p>

<p>你似乎没意识到也不肯承认当下制度的落后性，跟社会发展所需是互相冲突的，属于不兼容的矛盾。</p>

<p>脱离现实的认为社会将永远静止在当下这种状态，不会有爆发性矛盾的一直到永远。</p>

<p>你就维持这个立场到底，把身家性命全都赌在这个立场上不要变，然后健健康康活下去，你看看到底谁能笑到最后，我只担心你中途跳反想离船而已。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.31</strong> —–2023-01-20 22:32:25+08:00:</p>

<p>硬要说，有一些似是而非的例子。</p>

<p>但我认为人类历史上是没有可参考经验的（意味着只能打组合拳，但日本经验也许可以帮到我们，我们很多地方与他们相似）</p>

<p>这个规模的债务，以及新政府的财政来源，是我最头疼的事项之一。</p>

<p>因为这已经是无论中共倒台不倒台，都客观形成了的庞大问题。</p>

<p>其实我以前也谈过部分。</p>

<p>比如可能面临坏账潮，所以逻辑是第一时间保银行、保房贷家庭，这样可以避免融资渠道缩减，给企业一个活路。</p>

<p>但是到时候土地财政肯定没了，老龄化也导致人口红利没了。</p>

<p>更不能对需要发展的企业下刀子。</p>

<p>也就是说要给银行、家庭、企业这个三角循环里注入一大笔资金。</p>

<p>可是，超发货币的问题现在已经有了，而且还是中共日常拿来救命的手段。</p>

<p>能留给新政府的超发货币空间肯定是非常有限的，他们如果打内战，很可能靠超发手段掠夺剩余管制区的财富来供给军队。</p>

<p>新政府如果是对立面，更不能这样做了，所以财政压力很大，政府有钱的话这些都是有渠道解决的。</p>

<p>所以没钱，来钱的渠道都被中共破坏了，就特别头疼，你应该懂我的意思。</p>

<p>目前想到的三个合理方案，或者说组合拳。</p>

<p>第一，对党产和中共家族的财产进行大量没收（不清楚有多少，不以此作为长期手段）</p>

<p>第二，大规模债务重组，活化政府基建，出售一部分基建土地产权，然后很多事项给地方自负盈亏。</p>

<p>第三，求外部贷款或援助，日本、美国、欧洲、韩国。（烂摊子面前就没有脸不脸的了，拉下老脸能让国内经济转起来，丢脸就丢吧，没资格谈条件）</p>

<p>一和二有两个细节，如果社会矛盾扩大到全范围，并且烈度很高，会不会出现没收中共平民支持者财产的情况，我个人是不希望看到的，不符合求同存异的目标，但架不住有人把身家性命都赌上。</p>

<p>出手土地产权，外包私人业务给政府减负，会不会出现民众消费成本极高，公共服务政府支援不足的问题，比如一些我认为不应该太早放开，仍然有必要保留国企部分的产业。</p>

<p>至于债务，我认为能借到，在这个年代就是赚到，按美国的通胀逻辑就是薅羊毛了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.32</strong> —–2023-01-21 02:52:11+08:00:</p>

<p>国家资本主义是个看情况使用的概念，包括经济与政治层面。</p>

<p>你如果看资料能发现有很多不同使用的场合，但其实就我个人总结不复杂。</p>

<p>国家资本主义的本质，是社会公权力滥用行政干预，操控或者接入市场经济的运作，行政力量为主导，市场经济为依附。</p>

<p>如果你把它细化，还可以理解成权贵资本主义，因为能垄断公权力，滥用行政权的，本质也成为了权贵。</p>

<p>或者换个角度，它也可以运行的相对没那么私人化，也即官僚资本主义（通俗语境下跟权贵资本主义是一回事）</p>

<p>国家资本主义不一定是后两者，但后两者通常都较容易出现在国家资本主义当中。</p>

<p>因为国家资本主义下，政府已经控制了经济，将整个社会作为政府运行经济的工具，自然一切都可以是工具，这就导致了公帑可能被滥用，国内的财政可控性不在民众手中，变成了一种本末倒置的关系。</p>

<p>名词很难说具体概念来源，名词具体提出可能是德国社会主义威廉·李卜克内西，或者俄国人巴枯宁，更早一些恩格斯的叙述也有提及类似概念，更早一些我看到过一些十九世纪中前期的文献也有指出，但名词使用应该就是现在能查到的主要来源。</p>

<p>中共的运作其实不复杂，早期是通过吸纳知识精英、政治精英、经济精英为一体，通过社会的发展，把分配权与红利集中到他们手上，来保证精英阶层在自己船上，基层则有野蛮发展的红利。</p>

<p>当然，国家资本主义是一个框架，所以才需要细化到可能会演变成什么样。</p>

<p>随着持续发展，政权的不稳定性出现，中共开始尝试靠行政干预市场经济，加强政府在市场里的控制力，用政治权力卡死各种审批部门，给企业建立党委，然后扶持少数超级企业作为控制市场的工具。</p>

<p>顺便还会扶持各种白手套企业，这些企业明面上是私企，实际通过各种渠道，比如红二三代作为联系人物，或者吸收企业领导进入地方与中央的体制内（人大），从而形成一个不承担市场问题，却享受市场红利与决策权的地位。</p>

<p>同时他们把社会当作一种工具的体现，就是土地财政，过度饱和制造各种无效基建，违背了政府量入为出的运作准则，行政完全主导经济，也意味着市场无法自主。</p>

<p>中共的特点就是把所有经济劳作权，都以现代化和规范的名义集中到政府手里，不给你审批证件，你什么都做不了，政府要大规模搞基建，可以直接利用行政力量来调度资源。</p>

<p>比如上面提到的卡审核权，市场必须服从行政安排，农产品的定价与干预，让农民被迫让利，一切市场元素，虽然可能不受行政干预，但行政只要想，就可以微操，从而让自己获利。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.34</strong> —–2023-01-22 23:44:43+08:00:</p>

<p>威权仍然是人类社会目前的重要组成部分，即便欧美也是有威权的。</p>

<p>我这里主要谈政治上的威权构成，而不是社会演化上的威权构成，两者是可以分开的，我觉得你主要是问前者。</p>

<p>但重要的区别在于，威权的来源、构成、目的与使用逻辑。</p>

<p>一个社会的稳定不能单纯来自于威权，而是要来自于一套有共识的最大公约数机制。</p>

<p>当有了多数人认可，可以公开征名合法性后，才会被赋予法理威权，而传统的暴力威权，暴力的使用合法性，来自于法理赋予的职能。</p>

<p>每个人来到世上，除了父母子女这样的关系，都只能是一个人，操控不了其他人。</p>

<p>你不能命令其他人，其他人也不能命令你，我们服从一些要求的前提是我们认为有必要或者合理，比如被迫服从因为对方是老板，或者命令是法律的一部分，不遵从这种集体规则的人，会被排斥在集体规则外。</p>

<p>所以想要社会推行一些法案与方案，就需要组织。</p>

<p>大众不害怕一个犯罪分子，是因为与之对应的是一整个社会的集体，集体形成了特定的暴力机构用于维护集体，这是暴力与威权的目的。</p>

<p>所以看暴力的使用合理与否，就要看法理威权的来源是否合理。</p>

<p>比如说美国，美国有一套形成最大公约数的机制，允许公开验证法理的来源。</p>

<p>那么因为政治目的冲击国会，这件事行为本身就是一种违背集体共识的行为，有合理的道理不走，却走这条路，并非没有选举机制去给反对者一个翻盘的机会，也并非没有环境给反对者发表不同政治见解。</p>

<p>这也是为什么在这种背景下，美国政府的暴力机构有很强的合法性去执行，因为威权的来源正当合理，人们服从的是一个集体共识与法律规则，而并非服从个人、集团。</p>

<p>有国内的人可能救说，那我们中国也是合法合理啊，警察执法和政党执政都是走程序的啊。</p>

<p>到这一步，就有人会揣着明白装糊涂，但不排除有的人是真的这么认为，因为他们不理解两个社会的区别，但我想很多人心底跟明镜似的。</p>

<p>中国的威权，是纯粹来自于暴力，并非意识形态，六四后意识形态的合法性已经破产，因为暴力机构的枪口对准了有反对声音的群众。</p>

<p>而国内并不允许有明确的反对声音传出，社会是被暴力管制，而不是被暴力平衡。</p>

<p>美国的社会人们服从的不是暴力本身，而是暴力背后的法理基础。</p>

<p>在中国，暴力就是法理的来源，是先有暴力让所有人无法反对，等人们不能反驳，再说自己有法理。</p>

<p>无选举无证明，怎么知道你共产党是广大人民群众的选择？</p>

<p>所以你没有法理来源，你的一切行为是否得到大众授权，就打一个问号。如果你做的是损害大众利益的事，有利于你们集团自身，我们连质疑的渠道都没有。</p>

<p>因此更严谨的来说，是有法理基础的威权，以及无法理基础的威权。</p>

<p>当人们自身的共识在可验证机制下是威权的一部分时，社会其实就不是在靠政治上的威权维系，美国政府和社会不需要时不时找几个国民来杀鸡儆猴让人不要反抗自己的制度。</p>

<p>因为制度本身就是来自于大众通过公开的机制认可后的结果。</p>

<p>个别社会层面的威权现象则自然有，比如企业上司对下属，这是放大到人类社会型态演化上的，这里我不跑题了。</p>

<p>否则就是一种寒蝉效应，也即畏惧产生的不反抗，我服从你的政权并不是因为大家认可，而是因为拳头硬，而人追求美好和集体共识共存的观念是普世性的，如果没有弹簧一样的一个集团压制，社会将自发在生产力足够的情况下，演化出一套符合集体利益的政治制度。</p>

<p>在过去，中国政府纯粹是少数人拉起组织，形成其他人不可抗争的力量，将自身凌驾于集体的一种威权管制，合法性并非来自于大众集体共识，这也是中共宣传里希望欲盖弥彰的一个环节，说自己得到了农民的支持，但打击农民时，农民也并没有办法靠选举推翻他们。</p>

<p>【 不要先看到出一个问题，就激动得不要不要的，然后就得出结论——这个问题不正面解决中国就完蛋了。就你说的『权力过于集中』的问题，先想明白，权力集中有什么好处？有什么问题？</p>

<p>相对的，权力分散有什么好处？同时什么问题？<strong>正因为『权力集中』，才会有中国的集中力量办大事</strong>，<strong>才有资源做高铁，扶贫，环保，登月等等大事情，才会有过去40年的高速经济发展</strong> 】</p>

<p>改革开放的本质就是下放权力，放开政治上的规则，允许经济权力下放到社会个体，这是个基本社会常识。</p>

<p>社会的发展始自权力下放，承认私有产权。</p>

<p>为什么老是来那么多幻想，认为集中权力就做到了根本没做到的事。</p>

<p>集中资源与集中权力根本就是两个概念，故意或者不清楚就混淆两者是什么成分，现在什么外行会打字都能张嘴闭嘴说集中权力办大事了吧。</p>

<p>计划经济时代的权力比现在更集中，并没有给社会带来任何更好的发展。</p>

<p>最基本的一点，执政党到底是为了延续自身贵族集团利益而统治社会，还是作为一个不以自身利益为优先，有救国救民情怀的理想主义集体？</p>

<p>稍微有点社会常识和政治常识，都清楚当代的中共是前者，</p>

<p>在这个背景下，没有任何纠错机制，他们的权力集中带来了什么？</p>

<p>登月难道美国是权力高度集中吗？还有个对照组苏联。</p>

<p>什么是环保，环保是一刀切，搞的民不聊生么？被影响的群众上哪说理，有没有一个给他们基层纠错改变政策的渠道，我要求不高，四年改变一次，现在习近平第三届，有没有改善，明明变本加厉了。</p>

<p>扶贫扶贫，越扶越贫，本身就是政绩工程，外加更改贫困定义。许多地区的贫困本质是户籍制度和土地产权分配问题造成的社会困境，这些只有利于执政党的基本国策不改掉。</p>

<p>因为中共自身的合法性本身就只能依赖暴力，而不是社会共识和意识形态，连经济增长都提供不了，习近平现在巅峰集权了，社会问题反而继续加深。</p>

<p>你怎么解决产生问题的源头？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 同时『权力集中』也会带来容易陷入领导层一旦素餐尸位，会错过机会的问题。『权力分散』确实有可以互相制衡，<strong>防止一家独大赢家通吃，但也同时带来推进一件事就是多方互相扯皮，效率低下</strong>。 】</p>

<p>这就是一种典型的对分权环节存在错误认知的情况。</p>

<p>首先效率真的低下吗，并不，因为哪怕不参考发达国家这种明显例子，单纯看我国，集权最高峰的毛泽东时代，连经济生产权都被抓在手里。</p>

<p>可是没有带来效率的提高，相反是干脆没效率。</p>

<p>一个问题多方扯皮的根本，是因为负责执行问题的人根本没有权力，却要承担责任。</p>

<p>这是基层许多公务机构的现状，出事了他们背锅，有功劳领导来领。</p>

<p>包括社会层面也是，如果你不打算分出权力，给每个应当应份的人，就会造成你提出一个观点，无论对错你都想推行下去，却不能争取到多数人支持。</p>

<p>那么你怎么推行政策？</p>

<p>难道要冒社会反对的风险去做一个没有共识的事。</p>

<p>中共在国内宣传口径下所谓的权力分散民主办事效率低，之所以根本不成立，就是因为你办什么事都必须考虑持分者和你的法理来源。</p>

<p>你有股份我有股份，一件事就必然要在减小社会矛盾的前提下，去寻求最大公约数的共识，否则你做出来就是在撕裂社会，增加整体矛盾与不确定性。</p>

<p>国家的威权化，在特定时期可以是历史与社会的自然现象，但不能以此为借口不进步。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 即使看美国，也是在走权力集中的阶段，<strong>共和党这次搞中国特别委员会，就是在集中权力、资源针对中国搞事情。</strong> 】</p>

<p>共和党还是民主党，他们想要获得权力，难道靠杀死国民，然后禁止媒体发言，不允许有任何异议声音？</p>

<p>他们的权力来自于哪，没有选举或者程序赋予的合法性，他们一个人都指挥不动，更别提党内派系林立，还有一些跨党派合作的个人。</p>

<p>他们集权征求国内意见大体统一到一定程度，足够触及合法程序才会推行，要不然立那么多法给谁的。</p>

<p>【 『权力集中』和『权力分散』，各有利弊，没有绝对的对错。『权力集中』是一个选择，<strong>在当下这个阶段，面临贸易战、俄乌战争等等动荡的时局时，更加需要集中党的领导。</strong> 】</p>

<p>如果说一个小范围的集中权力与权力分散，哪个国家都存在。</p>

<p>但是扩大到一整个社会，整个国家和民族，所谓的权力集中，就是把国族交给一个无法制衡不负责的集权集团或个体手上。</p>

<p>类似的历史例子很多很多，希特勒的集权够多了，制造了数年的梦幻德意志美梦，然后就被挫骨扬灰，没有问题也给自己制造问题，渲染和跨大问题为自己集权基础炮制谎言。</p>

<p>没有人，也没有任何中国人，生下来必须遵从权力集中的规则。</p>

<p>你怎么强迫他们接受，还不是靠暴力靠威慑，用经济手段约束国民。</p>

<p>如果说习近平和中共，是靠选举公平公开公正的上台，我完全没意见。</p>

<p>你能选上那是你牛逼，我还会支持你，因为这是社会良性运作的游戏规则。</p>

<p>但如果你做不到，你凭什么说集权是合法的，合谁的法？</p>

<p>我生下来并没有一个天条刻在我身上，要求我必须服从中共，你也没有，谁有？谁都没有。</p>

<p>目前大众十分清楚，所谓的中共领导，只是一群贵族门阀利用国家政权机器，为自身的统治阶级谋取利益而已。</p>

<p>要是说建政初期的中共，起码的确是有很多人具备理想主义，包括毛泽东也是，然后走入了实践的死胡同，最后开始回归现实问题。</p>

<p>哪怕邓小平六四政变，堵死了中共和平转型的最后机会，让中共下台只能靠内战、内部分裂，他也是希望中国能发展更好，只是政治观念跟不上版本。</p>

<p>老一代人的问题老一代的办法，现代的人有新办法，这叫顺应时代。</p>

<p>现在台上的集团，纯粹就是当皇帝的心态，宁可牺牲中国的发展潜力，也要保住自己的江山，避免下台后因为历史问题被清算。</p>

<p>这是特权阶级的普遍心态，不见黄河不落泪，老一代很多人都反思，清朝本身不是必然会被推翻导致军阀混战，但清朝政府的自私自利，到了最后一刻才想起来改革，接着撒手不管，引发长期的混乱，被日寇觊觎引发入侵战争。</p>

<p>历史已然给了教训。</p>

<p>社会当下要发展，就需要简政放权，而不是把商业和社会发声、选择政党的权力都剥夺到自己手上，那样难道反对声音就消失了，难道政府就可以改写客观规律了？</p>

<p>中共不能改写客观经济规律，这是铁一般的事实，前些年反而中共特别喜欢吹嘘一切西方常识不适用中国，结果一一应验。</p>

<p>中共已经到了一个被问责要求改革的历史节点。</p>

<p>原本靠经济增长堵嘴的办法，开始不奏效，以后也没有高经济增长了。</p>

<p>【 这套经济制度赵紫阳在初期做出过重要贡献，但是经过江、习已经迭代过好几个版本了，和赵的最初版本已经有相当的不同了，就别把功劳都往赵身上安了。 】</p>

<p>你别搁着帮中共迭代了，中共的社会重大经济改革，在九十年代基本停滞，社会全面的改革到两千年初也看不到了。</p>

<p>连中共现在基本经济政策报告的路线和模式，都是赵紫阳在八零到八一年做政府经济工作相关报告上逐渐形成的。</p>

<p>把江泽民和习近平的重大改革拿出来，摊开了说我能一样样给你拆开看看到底是怎么回事，这种错误荒谬的论点，真就是你不打他就不倒。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 首先是赵的版本。<strong>赵的『社会主义市场经济』核心思路是十三大报告中的『国家调节市场，市场引导企业』</strong>，这也是赵在回忆录里明确提出的。而具体手段十三大报告中也有叙述是『国家运用经济手段、法律手段和必要的行政手段，调节市场供求关系，创造适宜的经济和社会环境，以此引导企业正确地进行经营决策』。<strong>赵虽然在推进市场经济，但还是国家来调节供需关系，和现代经济学的市场调节供需大相径庭。</strong> 】</p>

<p>十三大时期中国仍然使用双轨制，国企本身就是要被缩小在市场占比的，而私营企业还没有足够多的生产力与权限，去承担整个社会的消费品生产。</p>

<p>所以才有双轨制并轨的发生，并且中国有两次并轨。</p>

<p>一次是赵紫阳，一次是李鹏，都是按照赵紫阳的路线。</p>

<p>而背景则是，在当时中国政治上并不公开承认市场化的主导地位，有大量的左派保守势力抵触抵抗，甚至诋毁改革开放。</p>

<p>在这样的背景下，这就造成了赵紫阳纸面和实际执行就是两个方向，对左派保守势力的斗争与妥协，邓既要安抚船不翻，也要确保经济改革能推行下去。</p>

<p>那么到底是你找到的有限资料是赵紫阳的方向，还是事实做的是改革才是赵紫阳真正想推行的方向？</p>

<p>答案一目了然。</p>

<p>这就是你完全错误的地方，出发点都没搞清楚，后续怎么可能说得对。</p>

<p>赵紫阳做的事非常简单，缩小国企占比，扩大私营企业占比，解放财产所有权，允许和扩大私营经济，最终形成市场化。</p>

<p>这些基本要素构成了中国发展的根基。</p>

<p>赵紫阳的文献资料，好就好在极其详实，文集收录了十余年的工作报告。被软禁后退休有大量时间记述工作内容，国内那一代最顶尖的社科和农研的专业学者也有大量的资料库可以帮助修正。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 江在92年十四大报告上，对社会主义市场经济<strong>做了</strong>重大理论上的改变，表述已经变为的『市场在国家宏观调控下对资源配置起基础性作用』。</p>

<p>**政府可以宏观调控，但是政府是辅助，**供需关系是由市场而不是政府决定。和赵的版本已然不同了，基本上符合现代经济学了。 】</p>

<p>首先，这个就是赵紫阳追求的下个阶段，邓废其人用其言，江泽民来摘桃子而已。</p>

<p>江泽民是个在中央没根基，要退休了临时提拔上来的人，他说的一切都是来自于已有的观念和政府要工作的方向。</p>

<p>赵紫阳在八七年工作报告已经提出：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>　价格改革和物价问题是当前人们普遍关心和议论较多的问题。由于过去长期忽视<strong>价值规律</strong>的作用，国家对价格管得过多过死，我国的价格体系很不合理。如不进行改革，就不可能形成发展<strong>社会主义商品经济</strong>所不可缺少的<strong>完善的社会主义市场体系</strong>，不可能<strong>有效促进生产的发展和商品的流通</strong>，不可能正确<strong>引导社会消费</strong>，充满生机和活力的<strong>新的社会主义经济体制</strong>也就建立不起来。</p>

  <p>我国的经济体制改革，必须适应在<strong>社会主义公有制基础上发展有计划商品经济的要求，以增强企业活力、完善市场体系和健全宏观管理制度为主要内容</strong>。实践证明，<strong>这个既定的改革方向和总体部署是正确的</strong>。我们要<strong>充分认识改革的长期性和复杂性</strong>，善于根据形势的发展和变化，对<strong>改革的具体步骤和配套措施及时作出恰当安排。</strong></p>

  <p>国务院经过认真研究，确定<strong>１９８７年经济体制改革的主要任务</strong>是：<strong>以增强企业特别是全民所有制大中型企业活力为中心，着重改革企业经营机制和企业内部的领导体制</strong>，继续发展横向经济联合，适当加快金融改革步伐，<strong>进一步扩大生产资料市场，逐步改革和完善企业劳动工资制度和固定资产投资管理办法</strong>，并<strong>积极为下一步各方面的配套改革做好必要的准备</strong>。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>翻译一下就是，赶快把国企的落后产能淘汰，为市场化主导做准备，并且因为价格闯关的客观需求，所以这里赵紫阳默认是国企改革慢了，也有左派阻挠和旧体制跟不上的原因。</p>

<p>说白了，江泽民就是在赵紫阳路线上被推上来执行的一个人，到你这里变成江泽民“做出了”</p>

<p>请问江泽民什么时候才上台的，跨时空提前几年就在1987年对着赵紫阳指点江山？</p>

<p>社会主义市场经济和实际的市场化改革，是赵紫阳在四川当地时就试图推广的概念。</p>

<p>江泽民在邓的监督下写入宪法，作为基本国策，跟江泽民本人有一毛钱关系吗，他刚上台还一度倒向左派，逼出南巡。</p>

<p>那么市场化改革到底是谁提出和执行的？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>再看看赵紫阳1988年说的话，直接把你整个对江做出这种改动的推测给否定了：</p>

<p>　</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>二、有领导有秩序地推进相互配套的全面改革</p>

  <p>　　我们要从根本上解决前进中面临的复杂问题，<strong>逐步建立社会主义商品经济新秩序</strong>，必须有领导有秩序地、坚决而稳步地全面深化改革。</p>

  <p>　　姚依林同志代表中央政治局将向全会作关于价格、工资改革初步方案的说明。关于<strong>价格改革</strong>，这里着重讲两个问题。</p>

  <p>　　第一，明年物价上涨幅度必须明显低于今年，此后几年每年物价上涨幅度必须控制在10%以内。这是衡量我国价格改革是否积极而又稳妥的一个尺度。从当前我国社会的承受能力和企业的消化能力来看，一般地说，如果物价上涨幅度达到两位数，企业就消化不了，势必造成轮番提价，影响经济和社会的稳定，搞得人心惶惶。</p>

  <p>　　那么，在上述物价上涨的控制幅度以内，**用五年或较多一点的时间能否达到初步理顺价格的目标呢?**这就要看我们能否有效地控制住社会总需求。只要总需求与总供给的缺口不大，自发涨价的压力就会相对缩小，价格改革的回旋余地就会相对扩大。</p>

  <p>因此，紧紧抓住治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序这两个环节，切实控制住社会总需求，我们就有可能在物价上涨幅度不太大的情况下，<strong>用五年或较多一点的时间初步理顺价格。我们要力争把这种可能性变成现实性。</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>看不懂我给你解读，赵紫阳希望用五年时间，实行价格可控，从而推进到商品经济秩序，也即是社会主义的市场经济。</p>

<p>1988年算五年，刚好在1993年。</p>

<p>再看看赵紫阳同时期的另一段话（也即所谓国家调节市场与市场引导企业的延伸表述，来看看到底你的判断是否属实）：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>第二，某些<strong>重要初级产品和原材料价格双轨制不可能也不应当在短期内取消</strong>。我们实行的是<strong>有计划的商品经济</strong>。</p>

  <p><strong>价格改革的目标，是逐步做到少数重要商品和劳务价格由国家定价，绝大多数商品价格放开，由市场调节，以适应“国家调节市场，市场引导企业”的要求。但是，这是需要经过长期努力才能实现的目标。</strong></p>

  <p>从我国的实际情况出发**，放开价格，实行市场调节，只能逐步进行**。近期可以放开的，应当是供大于求和供求矛盾不大的产品，主要是为数众多的消费品和工业制成品。</p>

  <p><strong>国家垄断的公用事业，例如铁路运输、通讯、电力等，仍由国家定价。</strong></p>

  <p>对极端重要并将长期短缺的初级产品和原材料，包括粮食、油料等农产品，煤炭、原油等燃料，钢、有色金属等原材料，不能硬性地过早取消双轨制。</p>

  <p>这些产品，<strong>如果没有市场调节这一轨，整个经济就无法搞活</strong>，特别是<strong>占工业产值1/4的乡镇企业就无法生存</strong>；但如果<strong>没有国家定价这一轨，就会造成包括人民生活必需品在内的众多产品的价格全面暴涨</strong>，物价上涨就无法控制，并将大大提高整个工业生产成本，使我国工业在国际市场上很快丧失竞争力。</p>

  <p>价格双轨制是我国一定历史条件下的产物，在商品经济还很不发达，<strong>市场远未发育的情况下，硬性取消看来是行不通的。</strong></p>

  <p>既然双轨制在一定时期内不可避免，就必须强化管理和监督，减少混乱现象，尽量限制它的弊端。这是对国家宏观调控提出的一个非常重要的课题。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这里就可以明确一点，赵紫阳做的是市场经济为主的，最终目标是取消双规制度，价格双轨制度的取消，才标志中国真正意义上向下放权，走上了市场为主的经济制度。</p>

<p>也即是说你的判断依据完全脱离实际了。</p>

<p>在公开讲话立，赵都难掩对市场经济为主导的肯定，更别提市场化本身就是他认同且喜欢的做法。</p>

<p>那么你提出的那个所谓观点，是怎么出现在赵紫阳的报告立的呢？</p>

<p>政治背景我们知道是左派的原因，但具体是哪个左派？</p>

<p>有答案。</p>

<p>是陈云！</p>

<p>陈云所写的《计划与市场问题》 里提到：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>整个社会主义时期经济必须有两个部分： </p>

  <p>    （1）计划经济部分（有计划按比例的部分）； </p>

  <p>    （2）市场调节部分（即不作计划，让它根据市场供求的变化进行生产，即带有“盲目”调节的部分）。 </p>

  <p>    <strong>第一部分是基本的主要的，第二部分是从属的次要的，但又是必需的。</strong> </p>

  <p>    既掌握了政权，又有了第一部分经济，就能够建设社会主义。第二部分只能是有益的补充（基本上是无害的）。 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>说白了就是给党内求稳求保守的左派一个集体交代，没有约束的前提下，赵紫阳早就甩开膀子干了。</p>

<p>陈云还是江泽民的支持者之一，一度改革停滞也是事实，不要颠倒了。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 十五大~十八大都是这个口径上修修补补，党的十五大提出“使市场在国家宏观调控下对资源配置起基础性作用”，党的十六大提出“在更大程度上发挥市场在资源配置中的基础性作用”，党的十七大提出“从制度上更好发挥市场在资源配置中的基础性作用”，党的十八大提出“更大程度更广范围发挥市场在资源配置中的基础性作用”。 】</p>

<p>结果到头来是不是跟我说的一模一样，对不对？</p>

<p>完全就是在赵紫阳订立的基本框架上修修补补，试图把这艘破船继续开下去。</p>

<p>这还只是党内的理论路线，实际的经济和改革政策呢？</p>

<p>有没有跳出过赵紫阳的思路和改革方向，能改的不改，不该改的干脆开倒车。</p>

<p>再看看赵紫阳对社会未来发展生态的态度：</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>　　<strong>工资制度和社会分配是大家普遍关心的问题</strong>。在价格改革过程中，必须保证绝<strong>大多数职工生活水平不下降，并能随着生产的发展有所改善</strong>，这是我们既定的方针。</p>

  <p>工资制度要<strong>有步骤地进行改革，着重克服平均主义。教育工作者、科技工作者、医疗卫生工作者和国家机关工作人员待遇偏低的问题</strong>，要有计划地解决。有些新办的国有公司，工资待遇过高，国家要加强管理，严格控制。对合法的高收入，要通过税收加以调节。对一切非法收入，必须依法严加取缔。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>也即是说，赵紫阳在当时已经意识到了这方面的消费与工资关系问题，虽然这些废话在后来中共官方表述里总是有，但再也没有更大规模的实质性改革，并非靠制度解放，而是靠专项工作来完成。</p>

<p>原本该改善的待遇，反而容易变成特事特办，千人计划什么的，还一地鸡毛。</p>

<p>反倒是劳动法的落实没做好，对特殊工时制度背书到很积极。</p>

<p>【 习在十八届三中全会上又做了一次重大的调整。其叙述为：『<strong>使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用和更好发挥政府作用</strong>』。如何理解？ 】</p>

<p>别如何理解了，大家不是傻子。</p>

<p>中共现在的官方论调，基本跟事实操作不统一，或者说完全按照他们自己的新理解去执行，而不是根据八九十年代的方向去理解。</p>

<p>这一套说白了就是国家资本主义。</p>

<p>再有就是必须强调，中国从未跳脱出陈云鸟笼经济的局部困境。</p>

<p>所以你把纸面理论定成什么就粗暴的理解，可以反应出你不怎么接触中国政府相关改革和实质性的工作，或者你接触了你也完全无法理解。</p>

<p>政府干预经济，对房地产的指导价就是个例子，市场没有发挥更好的自我调节作用，所以习近平的这些所谓市场在资源配置中起决定性作用纯属扯淡。</p>

<p>供销社在农资供应的占比里高达70%，就是一个典型事实与说的互相违背的客观结果。</p>

<p>行政干预价格，政府控制的国企在经济里的干预程度，这些都压根没有彻底去除，仍然占据很大比例，尤其是金融层面更常见。</p>

<p>言论与事实不符，这就导致你推论的基础有错误，所以你下面三条就显得尴尬。</p>

<p>【</p>

<ol>
  <li>市场只是在资源配置上起作用，不要把市场想成万能的，啥问题扔给市场就能解决。当美帝发动贸易战，强行扭曲原有的资源配置的时候，仅靠市场能解决么？当然不能，所以才会有中国政府出场和美国拉扯。】</li>
</ol>

<p>如果按照你的逻辑是市场只是在资源配置上起作用，那就是回到了你认为的赵紫阳做过的工作路线上。</p>

<p>那你就是前后互相矛盾，自己反对自己。</p>

<p>美国发动贸易战可以从国内获得法理支持，企业即便不高兴，这些决策也都是有法理来源。</p>

<p>中国呢？为什么我们需要服从一个我根本没法选择支持和反对，也没法发声的政权，擅自替全中国人做决定去敌对？</p>

<p>贸易战一开始只是经济上的矛盾为主，到后面则扩大到意识形态对立，为什么我要成为代价替中共承担后果。</p>

<p>为什么中共不可以下台，然后中国人选择一个意识形态更有利大众的政府，去跟美国人用非对抗性的关系合作，回归到八九十年代与美国的互动，而不是封闭对外交流然后煽动民族主义。</p>

<p>如果一个新政权可以靠选举获取合法执政与政策法理性，也根本不需要这些下三滥的三角猫招数试图苟延残喘了。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 2.在资源配置这个点上，市场是起决定性作用的。政府则是辅助的保障公平竞争，加强市场监管，维护市场秩序。】</p>

<p>公平竞争是指特殊工时制度？或者卡自己国家的各类产品审核，拼命放水给国企和大企业，占据主要就业和生产的中小企叫苦连天都不管一下么。</p>

<p>你不能一面让他们用畸形的社会制度，比如户籍制和土地公有，另一面又用畸形的政府财政制度，比如土地财政和分税制，去剥削民众然后自诩公平竞争。</p>

<p>一开始就根本不存在公平竞争，现在仍然用剪刀差，持城市和农村人口的价值红利。</p>

<p>最基本的一个问题你都无法绕开，政府是最大的地主，他们出地，然后又设置指导价，又不许房企降价过多导致房子不值钱。</p>

<p>但是他们自己作为最大地主，吃掉了最大的那一份，民众不能居者有其屋。</p>

<p>是应该怪政府控制土地资源，明明公有制却拿来获取利润，作为商品出售牟利？</p>

<p>还是怪民众自己不努力躺平，所以买不起房子？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 所谓更好的发挥政府作用。其实政府也是市场中的一员，如果政府能够做出一些前瞻性的，符合经济规律的事情，是能够抢先帮助企业占领市场的。比如中国的新能源汽车现在处于先进地位，和政府长期的补贴政策支持是分不开的。政府前瞻性在产业启动前期，能够有政策支持产业发展，能够快速的培育起一个健康的市场。】</p>

<p>补贴的钱，从哪来？补贴后的企业，有没有办法反哺全中国。</p>

<p>产业升级的前提是知识分子的自由化，对社会的影响力和经济控制权提高，但是政府一直限制和打压，怎么做到良性的自然产业升级。</p>

<p>现在你靠补贴，那经济危机了以后，政府没钱了，原本靠补贴占领的市场一下子全都退潮，这群名义私企，实际吃补贴严重的企业，能不能养活自己？</p>

<p>如果自己都不能养活，就别谈竞争了。</p>

<p>没有任何政府会没完没了投钱到一个无底洞，补贴跟政府能力低下当冤大头是两回事。</p>

<p>这种吃补贴一下闹很大，然后发现情况不对劲的事件也不是第一次听说。太阳底下没有新鲜事。</p>

<p>你就算补贴，最起码也应该经过一个民选议会对你进行审计，给你钱才是你的，不给你政府没资格滥用纳税人的公帑。</p>

<p>如果一个民选议会审议后得到了大比数通过，那说明多数人认为是合理的。</p>

<p>现实不是玩游戏，砸一堆钱进去就肯定有结果，在游戏里你当然是集权到极点了。</p>

<p>现实里你花的钱都不是你自己的，而是纳税人的，政府的收入是有限甚至可以推测的。</p>

<p>这些有限预算里，你怎么用必须有合理的公开审议，而不是拍脑袋就资助芯片什么的，然后今天是汽车，明天是那个。</p>

<p>交给企业，企业不承担社会公共服务，起码自负盈亏，政府的角色是保障民众的基本公共服务与社会秩序运转。</p>

<p>现在仗着花钱如流水，花的是我的钱，我心疼但我没权对他们做否定或串联一大批人去要求先经过我同意。</p>

<p>嗯？我前面给你拿数据了，你不可能看不到吧，其他人都看到了。</p>

<p>2016年地方总开支160437亿，全国债务付息4991亿，占比3.11%。</p>

<p>2021年地方总开支211272亿，全国债务付息10456亿，占比4.94%。</p>

<p>2016年地方总收入87195亿，全国债务付息4991亿，占比5.7%。</p>

<p>2021年地方总收入111077亿，全国债务付息10456亿，占比9.41%。</p>

<p>2022年1-8月地方总收入74427亿，全国债务付息占比7532亿，10.12%。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>因为土地不能变成税金收上来，而中央已经拿走大量优质税金。</p>

<p>因此中国的房价极高，是地方政府圈地出售的结果。</p>

<p>但中国依然受客观经济规律影响，经济下滑就用凯恩斯主义，大规模建造基建，吸纳泡沫爆发的可能性，不断滚债务雪球，来击鼓传花。</p>

<p>迟早要爆，这是大家都知道的事。</p>

<p>债务可以借新还旧，不断堆高，但是利息不能啊，你懂我意思吗？</p>

<p><strong>利息会不断侵蚀公共服务的空间，让地方政府的固定收入下滑，最终导致资金链断裂，因为土地销售是有极限的。</strong></p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【2. 请用数字来说明地方会陷入破产潮。极限是哪里？拆东墙补西墙是一个政府常见的操作手段，美帝也不是一直这么干么？按照你定义的破产。美帝联邦政府预算不足停摆几次，是不是美帝也该亡了？】</p>

<p>我要纠正你一个很多提到债务问题就拿GDP来挡枪，去默认不严重，跟着下一步用美国和日本举例觉得小题大嘴的情况。</p>

<p>美国日本，<strong>不是分税制</strong>。</p>

<p>明白什么意思吗？</p>

<p>我国的财政运转机制，是地方事多钱少，拿10元要办15元的事，逻辑上是必然无法有足够资金扩张和提高公共服务的。</p>

<p>中央靠分税制收缴财权，按照中央的计划经济思路去提供给有需要的地方资源，别说什么穷省靠富省转移支付，真那么有效不会有大凉山了，早就援建起来了。</p>

<p>真正起不来的原因就算因为中央只给有限度的资金，地方穷省发展可能要1000亿每年，中央只给500亿。</p>

<p>发达省份例如辽宁，也是不给你政策，你只能这样干等着。</p>

<p>中央的规划里只有少数城市是有行政资源倾斜的，那么其他省份是不是只能干等着等死？</p>

<p>不能突破一些中央对地方的权力束缚，比如辽宁省政府自己搞一个国企改革？那是实际上就是政权独立出去了。</p>

<p>在这种背景下，<strong>地方没钱就要靠土地财政。</strong></p>

<p>一旦有经济衰退，引发资产价格下滑，或者消费跟不上需求，引发通缩，前后两头堵死。</p>

<p>地方政府还不起利息，破产了，在中共这样的集权体系下，意味着什么，你应该懂吧？那就是改朝换代的前奏了，因为中国的政治和行政没有分家。</p>

<p>2020年的土地出让金中，上海、南京、苏州、成都、广州、北京、南京、武汉、杭州、天津、西安、重庆全部破千亿。</p>

<p>并且其中上海排第一，2952亿，是第四十四名中山的286亿的近十倍。</p>

<p>对比2019年的12个城市超100%，2020年有20个城市的依赖度达到了100%以上，其中还不包括中山这种99%依赖度的城市。</p>

<p>超过90%的有5个，低于90%，在50%以上的有13个城市。而同时期的香港，20/21年度4-9月的土地财政依赖度仅为15.8%，预算土地财政依赖度为20.6%，也即是预期20.6%的占比。</p>

<p>比同期深圳的27%还要低，而香港的收入预算，近年高峰为近6000亿港币，以及疫情期间的约5700亿港币，兑换人民币约为5044亿人民币与4800亿人民币。</p>

<p>2020年，全国公共收入预算最高的几个城市，只有上海（7046亿）和北京（5848亿）高过香港，深圳3857亿，广州更低，仅为1714亿。</p>

<p>疫情前，北京对土地财政依赖度是29%，上海28%，深圳19%，香港为24%。</p>

<p>疫情后，北京对土地财政依赖度是36%，上海42%，深圳27%，香港为20.6%。</p>

<p>你想一下，香港寸土寸金，被国内说是畸形社会，土地财政依赖度才这个比例。</p>

<p>然而国内还有划分，把低于50%算成低土地财政依赖度。</p>

<p>低于100%算中，超过20个城市在100%以上。</p>

<p>不用说全都崩，哪怕一个二三线城市出现了财政破产的危机，其他这些近似的都跑不了，在中国现代历史上出现哪怕一个，那也是前所未有的。</p>

<p>美国联邦政府可以停摆也不怕，因为提供地方公共服务的地方政府债务没问题，还可以良好运行，而且政府哪怕停摆，政权的结构和法理来自于选举基础，民众该吃吃该喝喝。</p>

<p>但是中国会怎么样？</p>

<p>中共弹压这么多年的声音，各种地方贵族势力，政府失去了对地方的控制权后，就算有人往山区里运枪，然后组建一个新政权他都管不了。</p>

<p>正因为美国这样的社会运行不依赖政府，权力下放到个体、企业与地方政府，所以你中央政府问题再多，也跟我地方无关，互相牵连也不至于整个社会连锁崩溃。</p>

<p>但中国会啊！失去控制权的中央，地方出现的独立主义或者对抗集团，靠打内战来解决吗？全国崩三四个省份，收不上税金，中央就变光杆司令了</p>

<p>现在中央的税金，大部分都来自于地方，地方害怕中央因此服从，而不是靠独立于政治的行政法理约束。</p>

<p>纯粹就是一个谁拳头大谁是爹的政治环境。</p>

<p>中央没钱了，遇到突发事件失去对地方控制了，地方武警和军队都调不动，这些人吃饭都是地方出钱，经中央的手和名义发而已，就跟黄巾起义后，皇帝还是皇帝吗？</p>

<p>你买得起房子吗？你买得起，那全中国还有多少人撑得住？</p>

<p>一旦房子也卖不出去，消费上不去，人口上不去，政府财政拿什么支撑？</p>

<p>能意识到我国到了多关键的一个危险时刻吗？还有的人在岁月静好。</p>

<p>2015年说我在国内说经济危机没人信，然后舆论开始管制加强，L型触底说杞人忧天，经济寒冬从2019年就开始，抛开疫情也会持续下跌，何况疫情期间的操作还大大加速了。</p>

<p>让中共那几年好不容易处理的债务问题一下子破功重新大幅度增速。</p>

<p>我们未来怎么还这笔钱？靠卖地？地都卖没了，穷鬼被榨到西历2050年了。</p>

<p>我虽然上一个回答已经提到这些了，但我还是单独给你再说一次，免得你看不到。</p>

<p>北京，也就是所谓的中央，他们的钱很多都来自于地方缴纳，而不是说他们有一个世外桃源可以生产一大笔钱去随便反哺。</p>

<p>中央的钱也要看地方能赚多少。</p>

<p>地方破产有两个情况：</p>

<p>第一，他们没了一大资金来源，原来的地方武警和军队的薪酬发不足。</p>

<p>第二，失去对地方社会的控制，广东有一半城市破产，管不了社会稳定和舆论维稳，这些地方的人和事，就都会按照自己的意愿行动。</p>

<p>现在社会维稳是靠资金才能做到的，集中人力物力去镇压少数区域，没钱你拿什么维稳？</p>

<p>今年封控结束就是一分钱都没有了，看看A4运动，地方政府反应过来了吗？完全跟不上。</p>

<p>军饷到时候你都发不出来，地方军队是听上千公里之外的习近平微操，机枪往前移动三米，还是谁给钱谁就是娘？</p>

<p>这个世界上没有比地方政府的税金更大的财政来源了。</p>

<p>军队国家化只会让军队服从行政命令，没有国家化意味着没有明确效忠对象，可以用钱来收买。</p>

<p>毕竟，地方政府都能破产，地方军队能不能发出军饷也是一目了然的。</p>

<p>再牛逼，现代这个年代你敢在一二线城市让军队上街杀人，就等着全国皆反吧。</p>

<p>说到底，还要多谢中共严防军队，反而把军队塑造成了离开文人政府就很难独立生存，难以形成军政府的一种结构，一旦有人控制地方政府的资金来源，地方的警备与军队力量都可能被原地转换。</p>

<p>现在任何中共的相对直接杀人要温和的维稳，都是建立在资金堆起来的优势上，可以精准微操，让基层人员服从命令去不惜代价办事。</p>

<p>假设是个人都看出来要改朝换代了，哪怕这个过程可能要多年才能彻底转换，那也会有人不听话，做不到对个别精准人士进行打击。</p>

<p>去年公务人员降薪，心里想一下真出事他们帮谁吧。</p>

<p>到底是中央搁着几千里能快速收复地方，还是地方先有反贼自己组织起来控制地方政权。</p>

<p>如果中国很小，反贼是折腾不起来的，但是幸运就幸运在中国很大，人数很多，不缺兵源和物理生存空间。</p>

<p>更别说中共自己扶持起来，在地方用于控制社会的那些市级、省级门阀家族，这群人如果看到你变弱了，百分之百会有人出来拼一拼。</p>

<p>中共拼命想塑造的，就是在他们执政下，社会是处于长期稳定，好像这样的景象就是永恒不变的，但他们不是神，无法控制客观历史和经济规律。</p>

<p>一旦有某件事让大众意识到存在潜在动荡的可能，且无法避免，人心思变就是趋势了。</p>

<p>看我给你的财政数据和土地依赖度就知道，利息的增速有多快，财政压力有多大。</p>

<p>除非中国人（包括你、你的父母、子女在内）养老和育儿愿意啃树皮，否则生活质量越高，对经济收入增长与公共福利的要求也会水涨船高，上哪变出来这些钱？</p>

<p>就算你能接受，中国也有几个亿不接受养老金只有两三百的农民。</p>

<p>什么都离不开钱，这就是资本主义，谈什么反贼气宇轩昂上街振臂高呼，然后大家就都反了就很扯淡，但是谈钱就不一样了，你没钱，谁都不听你的。</p>

<p>中共财政的最后安全期，就是最近十年到十五年，就算第三次分配的共同富裕把中产榨出汁了，也会破坏生产基础，只是短期饮鸠止渴而已。</p>

<p>所以我跟你说你一定要健健康康，你一生人活到本世纪中叶到下半段，什么形式我不打保票，但肯定能看到中共退场。</p>

<p>江自己总结的3件事：</p>

<ol>
  <li>确立了社会主义市场经济；</li>
  <li>把邓小平的理论列入了党章；</li>
  <li>“三个代表”。】</li>
</ol>

<p>​</p>

<p>抓抄的错误太多了，我挨个批给你看，让你死心死的明白，而且前面反驳你了也基本不看，就已经说明你根本没能力接这个话题。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>1.【确立了社会主义市场经济】</p>

<p>【 江的第1件事，实际是在赵的基础上大大的进了一步，明确了市场作为供需关系的调节主体。 】</p>

<p>社会主义市场经济的概念，如果不算顾准时期的提出，再跳就直接到了文革末期，赵紫阳背书的成都会议，彼时江泽民还不知道跟哪个团访问或工作。</p>

<p>包括市场经济的坚持推行，都是邓一脉的人坚持推广的。</p>

<p>陈云一脉以江泽民为首，普遍并不对改革太感兴趣，陈云老一辈的都是计划经济的支持者，最多放宽到鸟笼经济。</p>

<p>江泽民是个政治投机者，给什么用什么，自己并无理论和观念建树，纯粹是因为六四时期表现好，被李先念等人推到了这个位置。</p>

<p>92年宪法之前，赵紫阳已经搞了十来年的社会主义市场经济概念的推广，能不能别绕过去，好像到江泽民这里他才发明。</p>

<p>那么是不是江泽民拼了命才确立的？</p>

<p>不是。</p>

<p>但凡你稍微有点基本常识，都知道南巡是针对谁的，以及为什么邓小平要南巡。</p>

<p>江泽民和李鹏政府在改革停滞，政治上开始上倾向保守派，引发邓小平不满。</p>

<p>邓小平直接联系了赵紫阳的嫡系和许多改革派的人发声威慑，才让江泽民意识到问题严重性。</p>

<p>退一万步，那也是 邓小平理论的东西，跟他江泽民有什么关系，他确立拥护这种制度，他就也要下台。</p>

<p>而且你最暴论的地方是说赵紫阳是陈云路线的支持者，你连基本鸟笼经济是计划经济为主为辅都分不开吗？</p>

<p>我寻思《关于经济体制改革的决定》早就把赵紫阳的基本经济路线是什么都说清楚了，前面已经至少告诉过你一次，马洪跟赵紫阳谈话问到底什么是社会主义商品经济，赵紫阳说跟市场经济是一回事，怕有的人接受不了而已。</p>

<p>所以你这句话就是纯粹暴论【 <strong>江的第1件事，实际是在赵的基础上大大的进了一步，明确了市场作为供需关系的调节主体</strong>。 】</p>

<p>说半天你都不了解陈云、江泽民和赵紫阳这些人的路线区别。</p>

<p>还大大进了一步，这不就是颠倒黑白么，江泽民上台只是继续执行邓的意志和赵的路线政策，用的赵的人与班底，被人选上来宣布了早就决定好的事，就变成他推动的？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>【把邓小平的理论列入了党章】</p>

<p>【 第2件事，确立了改革的路线不动摇，邓的改革开放路线的不动摇。保守派如果想走回文革路线，那就要修党章。江不是改革派谁是改革派？ 】</p>

<p>南巡到底巡的是谁？谁不改革谁下台说的是谁？</p>

<p>江泽民负责管党务和外交为主，党务上王忍之由他负责，江泽民本心是希望改革，为什么放纵这个左派去攻击改革开放。</p>

<p>居然还能抛出姓资姓社的言论，90年人民日报点艹邓小平将近一整年，邓小平还没上纲上线，只是把矛盾局限在党内路线理论争议，让人用皇甫平的名义去吵。</p>

<p>结果李鹏马上出来点艹皇甫平，江泽民这个党务最高决策人，全程放任邓力群这样的左王开炮。你见过改革派是拿左派头子，放现在就是乌有之乡作家的人当传话筒的？邓力群想当总书记都被邓小平否了。</p>

<p>这样的人江泽民都敢放出来，最后把邓小平逼到上纲上线，亲自出来绕开江泽民的党中央，自己靠个人关系网和改革派的势力南巡，每到一个地方就点艹北京。</p>

<p>你去查查邓小平特地跑外地跟湖北省委书记关广富说的话。</p>

<p>明明他打个电话江泽民就能当天亲自去见他，为什么非要跑到外地让关广富一个地方大员去对北京说：</p>

<p>“ 改革开放的话不硬了，旗帜不鲜明了！这不对，有右的东　　西影响我们，也有左的东西影响我们。但根深蒂固的还是左的东西。 ”</p>

<p>谁不改革谁下台也出自他对关广富的对话，这个对话背景就是他让关广富转告北京。</p>

<p>北京谁负责？江泽民。</p>

<p>江泽民是真心要改革吗？一个被临时扶上来的机会主义者，在你们成长年代觉得好像在发展就默认为是改革派，南巡的历史和文献都摆在这，才多少年就无视掉了，这是什么毛病。</p>

<p>江泽民要是改革派，毛泽东也可以是市场经济的坚定支持者了。</p>

<p>不跟邓小平服软妥协，邓小平就算不找赵紫阳回来当总书记，随时把万里和田纪云拉起来接替他。</p>

<p>本身邓小平理论，以及赵紫阳的社会主义市场经济，能最后被确立，就算因为邓跟陈云一派系的交易，没有换掉江泽民，陈云等人放弃开倒车的计划，并且写明再选入邓安插的隔代结伴形成平衡。</p>

<p>按党内的情况，江泽民在中央的根基还没朱镕基深，李鹏更是瞧不上江泽民，因为他本来也想当总书记。</p>

<p>李鹏干了一年就留一堆烂摊子被撵走了，朱镕基这才上任给他擦屁股。</p>

<p>【 第3件事，三个代表。三个代表实际在回答一个问题，共产党为什么能长期执政下去。赵是对社会主义制度失去信心，寄托于议会制。江则给出了自己的答案：『中国共产党始终代表中国先进生产力的发展要求、始终代表中国先进文化的前进方向、始终代表中国最广大人民的根本利益』 】</p>

<p>说难听点就算卵用不顶的一个政治口号，甚至是纯粹政治性的大于可能存在的实用意义。</p>

<p>这玩意出来时都被嘲讽为三个戴表。为什么？</p>

<p>这些玩意别说在胡赵时代，就算在毛泽东时代也是有认知的，需要江泽民不痛不痒总结吗？</p>

<p>我也就是前面WTO给你堵了，要不然肯定也拿来说。</p>

<p>江泽民时期党建是最烂的，胡赵时期官员特殊化是要被查的，田纪云就因为一句话说他有给亲戚办事的嫌疑，就失去了进入常委的机会。</p>

<p>也是权贵资本主义发展最迅速的，李鹏家族此时开始进入电力系统，红色贵族全面植根于中国各处，都是江泽民对陈云李先念等老人投桃报李的产物。</p>

<p>拿什么代表广大人民的利益和先进性？六四杀人都不愿意道歉承认，说白了自吹自擂见光死，是骡子是马一拉出就现形，政治理论和口号到江泽民这一代彻底脱离群众才是事实。</p>

<p>中共能长期执政就两点：</p>

<p>第一，胡赵时期中兴，解决了毛泽东时代以来的政治问题、社会矛盾与经济问题，后续继承者一直沿用他们的人才储备、制度至今，开倒车必死，也是习近平时代诸多问题的来源。</p>

<p>第二，正确的时间进行了正确且成功的改革，吸收了国际市场的主要订单，并且邓的派系护航了很久，邓如果死在1989年六四结束后，我保证中国会开很大的倒车，也绝对不会有现在的发展成果。</p>

<p>说白了，中共大部分人并不会治国，从胡赵文献和大量当时执政的干部回忆录可以看出来，邓小平是不懂实际经济怎么执行的，但直觉告诉他市场经济就是好。</p>

<p>党内被认为懂经济的陈云和李先念，放现在那根本是无法与现代市场经济学兼容。</p>

<p>李鹏干脆评价是近几十年来最低的一个人，根本不懂经济，当几年总理就把国家经济搞的鸡飞狗跳。</p>

<p>【 怎么理解？</p>

<ol>
  <li>中共要<strong>代表最广大人民的根本利益</strong>。说明还是有一小部分的反贼不在『最广大』之中，这部分人支持与否其实不影响中共的政权，中共要团结的是大多数。<strong>只要抓住的了绝大多数人的支持</strong>，就不影响政权。】</li>
</ol>

<p>​</p>

<p>我也可以说我团结了广大人民群众，但因为中共有先发优势，所以资源比我多，可以堵住我的嘴巴，控制社会舆论，所以我发不出来，起码墙内政治与更离谱言论审核是确实存在的。</p>

<p>你用什么证明中共抓住了绝大多数人的支持，你能选举吗？你要是能让中共公平公开选举上台，我还用在这唠叨？</p>

<p>我要的不是中共下台，而是有这样的一个机制去证明你是合法政权。</p>

<p>而不是你说你代表了多数人，所以你就是，你就有合法性，没机制可以验证这些。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 2. 根本利益。不是所有利益。<strong>必然有一部分人民的利益无法照顾周全</strong>，<strong>要有所取舍。在决策时考虑的是长远利益</strong>，不是眼前利益，对暂时受到影响利益的人民要善于团结。】</p>

<p>凭什么？</p>

<p>首先你都无法证明中共是多数支持，也没法证明中共的合法性是独立于暴力的。</p>

<p>如果中共是个只能依靠暴力和某些恩惠才能存在的政权，无法植根于民众通过选举公开化的认可上，那本质跟古代王朝没区别，等着有一天虚弱了被推翻而已。</p>

<p>既然没法论证你让少数人牺牲利益的行为是具备合法性的，那么我不愿意的时候，你要是想堵我嘴，掩盖舆论，是不是从公序良俗层面就说不过，并且也不合法。</p>

<p>你无法解释这种行为的合法与合理性，就要求别人为你牺牲，那为什么不是反过来，我用更好的方法与重新构建外部和内部关系，牺牲一下中共与其铁杆支持者呢？</p>

<p>”为你好“，不能是一种万能借口。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 这就是为什么说江比赵高几个Level。江不但改革了，而且抓住了主要问题，而且做到了。在江治下，不但突破的六四带来的外交环境困难，经济也有较快增长。 】</p>

<p>首先你完全说错了赵紫阳的路线，把赵紫阳的改革成果安插到江泽民头上，具体详细前面说很多次了。</p>

<p>江泽民用的政府构成，给他和李鹏擦屁股的人，包括一直沿用到现在的一些人，比如官方喜欢的温铁军，或者王岐山，都是赵紫阳时期的学术人才储备梯队，是赵紫阳和嫡系杜润生从农研拉起来的，现在智库也没跳出他们当年的范畴。</p>

<p>给江泽民一个上台没多久就被邓小平南巡点艹，批不改革就下台的人说成了改革派，这是要干什么。</p>

<p>没有公开验证的黑箱多数支持就可以言出法随，说支持就支持，十几亿人都不会自己说话，被党默认成巨婴了，必须服从党的安排么。</p>

<p>为什么不是公开选举一次验证中共是个合法政权。</p>

<p>还是说中共只是嘴巴说的好听，实际是靠暴力控制社会的一个过渡性统治集团，毕竟元朝都将近一百年。</p>

<p>外部环境美国已经在赵紫阳和里根时代开始投资，形成了沉没成本，克林顿时代欧美经济也寻求新的增长点，处理经济不好的情况，中国就自然成了一个突破。</p>

<p>美国的熊猫派本身就是构建在邓赵的外交基础上，多边外交就是赵对外主要策略。</p>

<p>江泽民并非一无是处，江好就好在是个聪明受教育的投机者，知道分寸和自己怎么上来的，不像习近平一样乱来。</p>

<p>所以执行政策少干预不懂的地方也是有自知之明，起码对外交流是他能力突出的地方能发挥好的一点，工程、农业和经济一类的方向都是给别人干。</p>

<p>现在习近平放弃了邓赵的外交路线，美国的熊猫派自然死绝变屠龙派，而对日外交可以说是一塌糊涂，更别提党建，后面也就有个习近平更糟糕，九十年代有野蛮生长的背景，以至于江不至于太难堪。</p>

<p>但即便如此，大下岗时期的大量国企资源外流，党建腐烂化的趋势，这些都是避不开的，包括对社会舆论的收紧控制，也是从江时期开始，胡时期失败就没更深一步扩大，然后习的收紧成功了，这是胡赵时期自由化风气一点点从九十年代到两千年初被清除的结果。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 当然了，我觉得反贼们一定不会认这些，因为你们口中的『政治改革』，就一定是放弃社会主义制度，转为西方议会制。 】</p>

<p>这是人类的历史趋势。</p>

<p>十几亿人，凡事都取决于一个极少数无代表性无合法性的贵族统治阶级。</p>

<p>浪费税金和民族潜力在他们画大饼的道路上，我不清楚有什么必要必须服从这种秩序。</p>

<p>一个靠剪刀差，把农村人口当血包的统治集团，早就该淘汰了。</p>

<p>人类历史趋势是共和共议，不是取决于少数人的独断专行。</p>

<p>在我看来只有现代议会制，没有西方议会制，欧美日韩各国的议会制度也并不完全一致，但核心目的都是让社会更好的运作，形成最大公约数。</p>

<p>社会主义也是西方的社会主义，都是舶来品，如果一定要加个西方，那我看提起的人的本土意识到是区别性很强，该说西方的说，不该说的半个字不提，怕不是想自己当统治阶级才那么精准。</p>

<p>哪怕不谈这些，中共也迟早有一天要下台。</p>

<p>不敢去想这种必然客观历史规律，就等于默认中国人没未来，中共亡了就要让全中国全中华民族一起跟着陪葬，大有昭和玉碎的味道。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.42</strong> —–2023-01-23 15:25:05+08:00:</p>

<p>先从微观上入手为什么阻碍经济发展，我觉得金融和商业上去理解会非常直观。</p>

<p>财产所有权与经济权力，就是权力的一部分，如果过去是被人说“你不许干这个”，那么限制做这种事的，就是一种政治权力。</p>

<p>就跟如果有政治权力的人，说全国人不许穿内裤，你也无法反对，只能服从。</p>

<p>所以政治权力过于集中，是个现实里没有上限的问题制造机，意味着只要他想，可以随时干预你，无论是不是合理的。</p>

<p>那么回到商业与金融议题上。</p>

<p>任何国家高度发展离不开商业，商业意味着有大量的企业，会有大量的资金需求与个体积蓄。</p>

<p>这就形成了两种需求，一种是把积蓄收入再利用起来，避免通胀贬值。</p>

<p>另一种则是普遍的企业融资需求。</p>

<p>如果你的商业想进一步发展，必须有一个稳固安全的融资平台，让内外资流动，从而能让外部投资者进入，也能让内部的企业走出国门，有钱了能收购更好的企业资源。</p>

<p>这是产业升级不可避免的环节。</p>

<p>人类历史上目前还没出现一个国家，是高度封闭不跟外部交流，完全自产自销然后成为发达国家。</p>

<p>生活水平的提高，意味着对物资需求的种类和范畴有更广泛的要求，那么一个国家的原材料和商品产出，肯定无法满足。</p>

<p>比如说过去吃馒头就算幸福，国内的原材料可以管的住。</p>

<p>现在要喝可乐吃三文鱼才算幸福，就需要引入外资与进口产品。</p>

<p>越多外资与外部产品，意味着平民的购物选择更多，产品竞争更剧烈，就需要有更成熟的监管体系，但这里还不是更重要的。</p>

<p>中国是个十几亿人口的大国，要提高国民生活水平，就必然要保持对外贸易与开放。</p>

<p>想要生活水平与收入提高，就需要依赖中小企的发展。</p>

<p>而中小企依赖的融资渠道，民众依赖的投资理财空间，都有很高的自主权要求，这是我们没有的。</p>

<p>比如说，金融领域的信息实时性，差几分钟或者几十秒，就可能构成很大的落差。</p>

<p>更需要政府去搭建和监管一个成熟健全的平台，而不是控制过于严格以至于打断一条腿，这样对于许多企业融资来说并不理想，你不能说A股起不到融资作用，但是A股什么尿性大家都知道。</p>

<p>下放金融平台的操作权力，允许企业有更大的经济话语权，意味着政府的行政权力必须收缩，将经济的权力还给民间，就像改革开放对农民解绑一样。</p>

<p>有人说一放就乱了，那要政府干什么？政府需要扮演的就是一个不靠政策与行政权力随时干预，但能起到监督和立法的独立审视机构，全世界到处都是，说中国人办不到，那是纯纯的歧视。</p>

<p>你的互联网信息也需要有实时性，才能满足这些信息领域很关键的要求，网络长城也就不复存在，更不能从汇率上堵住人家，不让轻松汇走利润。</p>

<p>对企业与金融平台下放权力，也意味着中产、知识分子、中小企业主与城市阶级有进一步的社会控制权，社会发声也将更多。</p>

<p>就像改革开放后，对知识分子的禁锢开始解禁，社会上就多了更多声音，哪怕打击和污名化公知的浪潮一波接一波，但社会始终会有一定中层阶级的存在与声音。</p>

<p>这就意味着，产业升级让这群人有更多的社会话语权，政府过去对民间的控制力就必须缩减，两者不能兼容。</p>

<p>而政府就很喜欢在各方各面控制企业的生存权，包括各类巡查与审批权。</p>

<p>尤其是审批权上，中国在一些特定领域原本是可以弯道赛车，不说发展的一样好，但至少能有一定地位，比如游戏产业、电影产业。</p>

<p>但是太多行政干预，比如卡审核，版号的审核逻辑没有具体规则，拿上去一审就十几个月或者干脆没下文，如果这也企业私自拿去官方不受控的地方售卖，就会被国内拉入黑名单，彻底失去原生文化的国内市场。</p>

<p>那么这种行为的意义是什么？倒逼精品？其实跟不上来说就是不在乎你这种产业发展，因为你发展起来就控制不了你，反而可能因为你发展后在社会里的影响颇大，干脆不如不让你发展起来，或者哪怕发展也必须是完全在我政府的控制下。</p>

<p>人口较多的发达国家，在转型过程的上升期里，都给全世界贡献了不少的文化产业出口，日本的游戏、动漫、文旅等等，韩国的女团、电竞。</p>

<p>这些实际相当大程度构成了我国年轻人的娱乐偏好，就算不是日韩这些最熟悉的，欧美也是可以找到影子。</p>

<p>那为什么我国十几亿人的大国，却没有在经济的繁盛期，迎来对等的文化黄金期呢？相反还有倒退的痕迹？不如九十年代的文化产业发展势头，至少我觉得一个剧本不告诉你哪里有问题，就让你反复改十几上百次，这样的政治环境很难有文化的独立发展空间。</p>

<p>为什么政府经常要求某些领域想进入中国市场的企业，必须找一个指定代理合作，实际上就是在控制内外贸易的口子，把一切都放在自己眼皮底下管起来，这种控制无处不在。</p>

<p>如果企业想做什么，想获得什么权力，都被官方担忧会不会做大影响他们自己的生存空间失去对社会的控制权，那一个注定要发展起来分散权力的社会形态，是不可能跟他们兼容的。</p>

<p>这也是为什么说中共本质是个古代政权，换皮大清而已。</p>

<p>这些一切的问题根源，都在于政府为什么要管的那么宽。</p>

<p>就像计划经济时代，农民是不明白为什么政府要管他们，要征粮要没收。</p>

<p>谁给了政府权力管天管地？为什么社会要服从？</p>

<p>如果不改革政治体制，去重新搞清楚中共的执政合法性，那么他们做什么事，影响到社会利益时，就会产生矛盾。（因为大家搞不清楚自己好端端凭什么被你管，你政府有没有一个合法性的来源，法理从哪来的？）</p>

<p>社会有公序良俗维持自身的规则运作，政府的过度干涉，而民间没有对政府干预和监督纠错的机制，就导致政府与民众的隶属关系颠倒，政府变成了民众的主人，而不是政府只是民众集体共识下权力的代行人。</p>

<p>一个社会的管理和协调者，把自己摆在了统治者的位置上，在社会发展还不足够高时，可以将就。就像你没法在古代社会搞现代意义的民主和分权一样。</p>

<p>但社会发展到了需要转型时，中共还死撑着不放，问题会很大了。</p>

<p>就跟螃蟹长大要换壳，万一壳有意识，认为自己才是螃蟹的主人，坚持不让蜕皮，螃蟹会不会无法发展，错过发育机会呢？</p>

<p>答案不言自明。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.43</strong> —–2023-01-23 15:54:25+08:00:</p>

<p>实际上即便不谈产业改革，单独谈社会制度上，政治制度不改革会带来的问题也是显而易见的。</p>

<p>中共执政依赖剪刀差，也依赖分税控制地方财政。</p>

<p>这样做的目的是在工业社会提供廉价劳动力（农民好欺负就多欺负点）</p>

<p>同时收缴财权，避免地方有钱了跟中央唱反调，这些都可以看出本质就是个古代政权，精神内核是打江山坐江山，并没有现代化。</p>

<p>社会制度决定了生产结构、劳动力与生产的关系。</p>

<p>户籍制度区别了城乡差异，公共服务却是跟着城市走，而不是全国统一。</p>

<p>政策也不是地方能独立自主制定，需要服从中央的资源分配，比如行政政策与转移支付。</p>

<p>这意味着农村人口需要涌入城市，才能有相对好的公共服务、就业与收入。</p>

<p>从而为城市阶级创造廉价劳动力，降低生活成本去避免城市阶级有较高的稳定性。</p>

<p>进而继续从工业化更高的城市消费获取大量优质税金，而不能征收的不动产，则通过土地财政形式二次“征税”</p>

<p>因为分税制下，地方没钱，就把中央拿不走的土地变现，但名义上又是社会主义国家，土地公有制下没私人土地。</p>

<p>政府却偏偏拿来卖，卖到高价钱在开发商那脱手，相当于赚到真实收入，但是不承担土地以类似税收形式转入政府囊中的政府责任。</p>

<p>而地方政府没有财权，权力构成就来自于上方的安排，因此政绩思维，尤其是保就业的观念非常根深蒂固，他们没法允许社会有不稳定，政府收缴太多权力，出问题都会归结在他们身上。</p>

<p>那么遇到客观经济危机，解决办法就是发债去大规模制造基建，没有需求创造需求，创造就业，这种方法在基建有需求的时代是可行的。</p>

<p>但是随着入不敷出，并且项目完工后经济重新开始冷却，经济问题也没有得到真正解决，就必须不断展开投资。</p>

<p>投资又要大量卖地，又要举债，就形成了一个很神奇的局面。</p>

<p>老百姓的收入远远跟不上政府推高的房价，政府的公共服务水平没有对等增长，却债台高筑，而且往往是把未来的土地规划、举债空间一次性扫空，这就是寅吃卯粮，用的越多，中国未来的经济潜力越弱。</p>

<p><strong>让后代们根本没有充足可用的预备经济手段，这是祸害中国几代人，乃至整个二十一世纪自我调节能力和竞争力的一种极为恶劣的执政手法。</strong></p>

<p>政治改革在这个背景下要干什么就很清晰了。</p>

<p>交还财权给地方，权力自下而上，无需要被上方的政治运动影响，地方监督财权，寅吃卯粮的模式改为量入为出，赚多少花多少钱。</p>

<p>这样可以脱离政府卖地的模式，让土地流转的商品属性不再受人为因素局限。</p>

<p>取消户籍制度，有序地逐渐让人口自然分配，让公共服务不再跟着中央分好的政策，各地八仙过海各显神通。</p>

<p>这样可以提高劳动力的价格，进一步刺激消费（我这里还没提工会待遇，政府也是针对打压的）</p>

<p>农村人口自然进城，原来的一二线可以减少过剩人口，因为生活成本更高，不需要在大城市卷，自然有得选三四线城市。</p>

<p>三四线的人口流失减少，总体人口得到扩充，经济也能更好。</p>

<p>农村仍然会因为大量人口进城而人口流失，但是允许土地私有制意味着愿意留下的农民可以低成本购地，从而实现大规模的集中耕种，而不是现在的土地碎片化，所有权归属不明白还没人耕种，出现大量荒地。</p>

<p>现在政权制定有利于他们的社会基本结构，就是导致这些问题无法得到解决，反而越憋越严重的根源。</p>

<p>最重要的是政府浪费未来资金和财政储备空间，去造一些可能完全没有经济价值的产物，没有这些储备很难去注入市场拯救房地产泡沫破裂后的家庭、企业、银行。</p>

<p>但是政府又是房地产泡沫和没有财政储备空间的根本原因，属于两头吃完两头把中国人的出路堵死，一股子我死后哪管洪水滔天的味道。</p>

<p>如果中国的房地产泡沫破裂，或者任何意外引发严重的通缩，家庭、企业、银行出现连锁崩溃，改革开放以来的许多成果都会消失。</p>

<p>日本在最富的阶段出现了类似情况，还是在完成内需消费转型后才有，依然无法避免市场出清带来的大量社会转型矛盾。</p>

<p>中国未富先老，内需社会也没影子，产业升级也没影子，对外贸易最拿手的开始逐渐有其他精品替代（越南、印度），拖越久越糟糕。</p>

<p>就像一个人脚不断长大，鞋也要不断换，否则硬捂着就变成裹小脚，寸步难行。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1958.44</strong> —–2023-01-26 00:27:28+08:00:</p>

<p>【 这你就把改开的理解，瞬间降低拉低了好几个层次，只看到一点点片面。一开始就错得离谱，后面的大段议论真就不忍直视了。我真替你的理论水平捉急。 】</p>

<p>行了，你能反驳就直接挑毛病，反驳不了别来这套了，你又不是第一个我遇到的这个类型的人，行为模式与反应来来去去就这些，我的建议是来点新意。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 改革开放的本质是什么，邓在十一届三中全会的标志性的演讲稿的题目已经说明了——《解放思想，实事求是，团结一致向前看》，如果在加一条，那就是四项基本原则。</p>

<p>所谓解放思想，就是谁的工具有效就用谁的。资本主义的市场经济好用，我这社会主义也可以用。如果资本主义的科技好用，社会主义也可以学习。**『下放权力』是从属于市场经济的一部分，市场经济又从属于解放思想的一部分。**下放权力仅仅是改革开放的一个小片面。</p>

<p>所谓实事求是，就是承认中国在一些方面落后，认清现实，从现实出发，少谈多做。同时，实事求是也是资本主义制度也有其问题，要看清、认清。</p>

<p>所谓团结一致向前看，是中共历来的统一战线路线，团结一切可以团结的人。如果国内不团结，那么很多事情就是内耗，无法做成。】</p>

<p>你说反了，实事求是是基于不完全放弃执政权的基础，承认资本主义的市场经济对社会主义一样有利。</p>

<p>本质上就是社会主义战败，必须转向市场经济，但因为意识形态和牌坊的问题，不能一口气说放弃社会主义就放弃，这样等同于放弃他们一切执政合法性。</p>

<p>因此就出现了”实事求是“，说我们先用着这个市场经济，一点点忽悠人建成社会主义，至于这种理想国路上的问题无论如何，都不会去谈放弃权力这个关键词，</p>

<p>你用这个市场经济的工具，是因为你的路线错了，你的路线错了，你的执政基础就不存在。</p>

<p>所以中共此时的意识形态是自我矛盾，无法逻辑自洽的。</p>

<p>权力下放是最基本的一切，权力决定一切，有权力就可以指鹿为马。</p>

<p>指鹿为马的权力下放了，才有实事求是的空间。</p>

<p>枪杆子在中共手里，平民是不允许实事求是的。</p>

<p>改革开放的本质，就是放弃原来对经济的控制权，允许民众根据自然秩序进行生产和贸易。</p>

<p>实事求是只是承认了社会主义的意识形态败退，找到一个折中体面的说辞去解释为什么选择市场经济而已。</p>

<p>毕竟中国是不存在唯党史观的，没有什么天理说中共必须执政。</p>

<p>你也承认，对不对，这里不反对就是默认上面我说的正确了。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 而四项基本原则，最重要的坚持党的领导，没有党的领导，党不把自身做好，形成战斗力，遇到问题不首先想办法党来解决，指望更换一种制度，换其他党上台就能解决就是痴人说梦。邓把它写入了宪法。所以邓、江、胡、习历来都极其重视党的建设。</p>

<p>邓小平理论，核心是『一个中心，两个基本点』，两个基本点，一个是改革开放，一个是四项基本原则，四项基本原则和改革开放是平级的，没有四项基本原则，没有共产党的领导，改革开放就搞不起来。】</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>问题不首先想办法党来解决，指望更换一种制度，换其他党上台就能解决就是痴人说梦。</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>你就看一下你这种暴论能不能逻辑自洽就行了，如果不能逻辑自洽，你自己都做不到实事求是。</p>

<p>第一，有没有验证过，只有共产党才做得到。没有。</p>

<p>第二， 有问题为什么解决的权力都在党的手里？不肯解释。</p>

<p>第三，党的权力来自于谁？</p>

<p>第四，党的属性是代理人还是人民群众的主人？</p>

<p>第五，当共产党不能解决问题，也不能验证合法性时，可不可以把中共换掉？</p>

<p>可以啊，完全可以。</p>

<p>这是天经地义的事。</p>

<p>你说再多，不占这个理，你能说什么。</p>

<p>改革开放的最终社会演化，是与中共四项基本原则互相抵触的。</p>

<p>社会最终会发展起来，并且民间的精英阶层与多数民众，会索要属于自己被夺走的权力。</p>

<p>这个时候请问共产党是应该杀平民保政权，还是放权放弃四个基本原则。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 你当然可以觉得不爽，但是邓小平理论就是实践出来的，就是好用，就是靠邓论中国做上了老二的位置。 】</p>

<p>邓小平压根都不负责一线工作，甚至不懂经济，实际调研都是赵紫阳跑各地负责的。</p>

<p>难道邓小平从虚空中摸索出理论，梦里有仙人给他三卷天书？</p>

<p>突然就顿悟出了邓小平理论伟大起来，那毛泽东时代怎么不见提起呢。</p>

<p>又如何解释邓不负责基层工作，却依赖赵紫阳组织和办事，邓小平理论又有与赵紫阳观点高度重合的地方。</p>

<p>你的逻辑不就是谁拳头大，谁打赢了就可以摘桃子么，当别人傻子么，嘴上为了不愿意承认赵紫阳的实际影响力，邓都不负责一线工作还在这说靠邓的理论做上老二，做到哪门子实事求是了。</p>

<p>现在也是靠邓的理论，中国选出了习近平，被围追堵截，内忧外患，三年封控后突然解封。</p>

<p>更别提前几届，比如前常委姚依林女婿孟学农、王岐山轮流当北京市长，王岐山被习近平破例留任，李鹏是最早的红二代之一，不但做到了总理和常委，还想当总书记，并且让子女控制电力系统，还想扶持儿子李小鹏进中央主政，也进了中央委员，俞正声又是谁儿子去查查，更别提薄熙来这样的存在了。</p>

<p>这还只是在邓小平坚持中共子女要从商，不要涉政的前提下。</p>

<p>去看看陈云说的红色江山红色子弟是什么政策路线，习近平上位集权就是大功告成，宣布邓小平的路线破产。</p>

<p>而且还包括大量在地方市上的家族，这些盘根错节不上报纸和关注不代表不存在，你自己接触过吗？</p>

<p>美国议员也好，还是总统也罢，这些公职身份需不需要选举？</p>

<p>政治世家不可怕，因为这是职业，可怕的是权力都必须集中在中共手里，不用选举全靠内部流程，也不许监督，那凭什么啊？美国人可以监督和选举是落后，我们黑箱操作出太子党接班是先进？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 懂了，美国的权力集中就是合法的。中国的权力集中就是非法的。你这双标的可以。 】</p>

<p>对啊，美国权力集中本来就是走公开的合法渠道达成的，只是行使法律赋予的权力。</p>

<p>中共集权有通过合法程序与选举来验证吗？本来就是非法的。</p>

<p>一个政党垄断全国所有权力和话语权，不承认它是非法的，本身就是一种叛国。</p>

<p>我唯一标准就是公平公开公正的选举渠道去赋予合法性，中共能做到我也不需要反对。</p>

<p>以前好歹在网上可以评击中共政策或称赞，现在别说评击了，谈都不让谈，称赞也会有封号风险。</p>

<p>这叫做社会进步？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 具体是什么西方常识？ 】</p>

<p>经济啊，社会发展啊。</p>

<p>比如经济说中国持续发展会遇到结构性的危机，但2015年前还没显露，15年时也不明显，国内内宣就说不适用于中国。</p>

<p>说没有人出来反对政府，去年A4运动就出现了？出来直接在上海核心地段喊习近平下台，共产党下台，各地大喊反习近平的口号，北京大半夜游行。</p>

<p>这是不是民众有需求了，应该聆听，然后下台。</p>

<p>你赖在台上不走的合理依据是什么？</p>

<p>这些戳你脊梁骨的东西其实你根本没法回答，你这是为了中国人吗？</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 笑了。拜托，牺牲了什么中国的发展潜力？ 】</p>

<p>大下岗、房价、劳动待遇、农民待遇、选举权、新闻权力、言论自由、社会福利。</p>

<p>最基本的三点</p>

<p>房价</p>

<p>劳动待遇</p>

<p>社会福利</p>

<p>土地财政导致全国房价高涨，中共是不是应该引咎下台，赵紫阳时代可没搞出这种东西。</p>

<p>劳动待遇到现在连个劳动法都执行不好，消极执行，还为特殊工时的996背书。</p>

<p>社会福利，超发货币与债务，挤兑未来公共财政收入空间，现在没钱了就发债，那以后怎么办？中央集权管不好各地，导致各地债台高筑，是不是反应集权在政治制度以外的危险。</p>

<p>说白了你压根没把中国人当人，自己想当中共那样的统治阶级才维护这个制度。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 这还需要要求么？抗疫三年中国政府表现绝对Top3的存在。 】</p>

<p>你是哪个平行位面穿越过来的，给我看看你的穿梭机器。</p>

<p>我们这个位面的中共，三年封控，导致经济下滑与大规模社会问题，随后因为没钱了突然无任何缓冲解封，导致大规模快速感染，让医院和社会完全无法准备。</p>

<p>那高压封控三年的意义何在？三年难道不是给你准备缓冲逐渐放开，有更多医疗资源的？</p>

<p>结果是屁都没有，瞬间解封，医院都没行政通知，还需要把休假的人临时叫回来。</p>

<p>然后更神奇的操作是，直接给前线医疗人员减薪，公职人员也减薪，你发债那么多干什么么，医护人员现在被你坑了，高压三年突然解封推到前线，居然还减薪？</p>

<p>哪怕不讨论政治和政权问题，只谈政府行政效率和脑回路，这是什么逻辑，政府现在对此是装死的，不谈就等于不存在。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 无论是社交媒体，中国主流思想又开始回归集体主义了。虽然你不爽，《战狼》《流浪地球》就是这种背景下的文化产物。 】</p>

<p>所以我才问你是哪个平行位面来的。</p>

<p>太难绷了。</p>

<p>你要是前几年说，我还信，现在战狼都被解构成什么样了。</p>

<p>能不能更下国内社会生态的版本，昊京依托答辩是调侃什么的，真以为有那么强的神圣性么？</p>

<p>忘记没忘记去年早期美国情报就是个笑话，以及佩洛西访台的笑话，马前卒的合订本那才真叫节目效果爆炸。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【 你脑子里吧，有个刻板印象，就是集中权力的人总想和大众对着干，其实吧，更多情况是团结大众一起干。 】</p>

<p>这不叫刻板印象，而是一个成年人有基本判断能力。</p>

<p>集权是为了其自身，而当中共自身存在与客观社会发展规律互相抵触时，集权为了自身的同时，就是在折腾大多数人。</p>

<p>三年高压疫情，折腾上海人，然后年末突然无任何预备和缓冲解封。</p>

<p>经济和外交上抛弃邓的策略，开始主动与美国在各地竞争，把贸易冲突上升到政治和意识形态存亡冲突，跟着被人围追堵截，前几年都说没关系美国必输，现在一看好家伙，我们被困了。</p>

<p>集权也可以集中力量办错事，尤其是没人能制衡的时候。</p>

<p>中共迟早要下台，社会反对声音也在增加，你这种论调就像十九世纪末的清朝保皇党一样，压根也不新鲜。</p>

<p>所以我前面就跟你说了，粉红和反贼的政治斗争，现阶段已经以粉红彻底落败告终。</p>

<p>他们脱离墙内堵嘴的环境，没有任何理论先进性和道德制高点。</p>

<p>反贼只需要等历史车轮碾过去，就会有越来越多的支持者。</p>

<p>为什么这些中文网络社区人数越来越多，重要性也越来越强，以至于被马前卒和墙内都注意到了。你为什么翻墙到这个SUB心里没数吗？</p>

<p>你要是为了跟我抬杠嘴硬，我到能理解。起码反贼敢上街反对中共，你这样的人，我赌你肯定不会为了维护中共去投入身家性命。</p>

<p>到冲突公开化时，反贼的敌人就少一个，因为你既然是为了抬杠嘴硬，说明你知道问题存在，只是立场和情绪不愿意接受，也就是说到时候就肯定不会跟反贼拼命，只会顺从。</p>

<p>你要是真的没现实感，人麻木失判到这个地步，那也是壮大反贼，粉红大部分没有现实危机感，宁可假设问题不存在，也不会假设可能有问题去未雨绸缪，是反贼获得理论和道德高地的根本原因。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1960.1</strong> —–2023-01-15 02:00:07+08:00:</p>

<p>当时清廷实际还有应对手段，彻底完蛋是在辛酉政变后，咸丰基本默许肃顺搞不分满汉的政策，让满人内部带头去统领汉臣，来降低满汉区别，这个工作皇帝是没法亲身下场做的。</p>

<p>后来主要问题的确出自地方汉臣分权，但归根结底是清廷保守派以慈禧为首，政变杀死肃顺，直接导致长期累积与汉人联系的满人内部集团被颠覆，之后再也找不出合适人选替代肃顺角色。</p>

<p>地方分权从顺势的朝政改革转为满汉有别，没有这种安全过渡到地方改革分权的基础，直接导致后期清廷中央无人愿意转型立宪制交权，慈禧到最后才不得不去准备立宪，结果因为太晚，导致没有时间完成，直接刺激革命党激进化。</p>

<p>百日维权的放权失败，培育出了光绪这样不成熟的皇帝，其实就体现了慈禧控制局面但不为未来考虑的结果，杀肃顺那一刻就没回头路了，慈禧作为满人保守派代表也更不可能在杀死满人改革派后，以一个实权皇太后的身份去用更亲近的关系维持地方汉臣和清廷和睦有序。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1960.2</strong> —–2023-01-15 21:33:54+08:00:</p>

<p>所以说辛酉政变是分水岭，因为咸丰和肃顺基本打算放弃满汉之分，肃顺也打算推行满汉不分，类似中华民族一样的集体政策，结果政变后，看似保护满人利益，实际堵死了满人未来变革的一切空间，只能装硬汉靠暴力了。</p>

<p>虽然胡春华显然是没有原本预期的地位，但是扶贫工作在国务院和党内算是一个政治性强的项目，直接涉及农村工作，尤其是国内的基层问题，管理大量国务院副职干部工作，不让进常委羞辱性更大，当然，远比不上羞辱李克强。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1963.1</strong> —–2023-01-14 22:24:14+08:00:</p>

<p>如果不考虑还债的话，债务周期到了基本都是想办法各种折腾，或者借新还旧的拆东墙补西墙玩法。</p>

<p>所以关注指标集中在政府自己公布的债务付息增速就行，因为政府可以搞各种手段去“优化”债务结构，只有当付息压迫政府财政到了无法正常运作时，才有爆破风险。</p>

<p>债务本身不可怕，可怕的是债务付息在当下政府结构里造成的不可逆影响。</p>

<p>分税制意味着地方债务一旦滚雪球，是无法自行处理的，因为利息就会吃掉大部分公共服务的财政开支，这意味着地方进入无政府状态的概率大大增加，尤其是拖欠公职人员薪酬。</p>

<p>鉴于中共喜欢拆东墙补西墙，蚊子腿喜欢分八餐吃，会有大量方案去从社会层面敛财，重组优化债务也会有，但是效果会越来越有限，因为总要有人接盘，接多了大家也不傻。</p>

<p>所以中共目前瞄上了直接税，房产税这些试点推行效果不乐观，以后搞不好会强推。</p>

<p>但总体上他们目的是按照自己的政治语境去执行“第三次分配”，这些组合拳大概能帮政府维持多五到十年的安全运营期，避免提前进入连锁破产潮。</p>

<p>不过加速总比预期快，地方出财困的速度，总比中央快，早期中央的财政能力和反应在单一事件还跟得上，比如鹤岗，一旦后期多起来，就跟不上了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1963.2</strong> —–2023-01-16 20:08:06+08:00:</p>

<p>各种明面和台下的隐形债，这些没法完整统计，所以我主张是看利息，利息不会骗人，毕竟债是不打算还，借新还旧是必然的，那么看利息开销就知道实际情况，目前债务周期平均大概8.5年，下次周期在2030年前就会逐渐到来，到时候有好戏看。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1966.1</strong> —–2023-01-15 01:24:57+08:00:</p>

<p>党内老干部出身除了可查姓名的一群人外</p>

<p>还有一批人是你查不到姓名，也不可考，这群人未必担任过正职，甚至党务上地位也不高，但是确确实实构成填充了中共前期和中期的大量关系网，成分和落差极其复杂。</p>

<p>因为文革的原因，左右矛盾带来的派系斗争，导致就算后来平反，僧多粥少也导致能让子孙后代直接受庇护的数量有限，尤其是有时候有的人不受待见，这是有名有姓的。</p>

<p>前面提到那种没名没姓的就很难察觉，比如我知道的一个例子，这个人终生职务都不高没进中央，在铁路系统，是建国前的老干部，年纪比较大，在地方混得开，文革被批为“三开”，也就是国民党时混得开，日本人来混得开，共产党在混得开，作为被批的主要依据。（我估计是跟张作霖有关系的人）</p>

<p>但是这个人因为党务上矛盾不大，在地方威望十分高，并且跟滕代远、万里这些人关系好，有人抬了一手所以本身没吃太大挂落。</p>

<p>解放早期是在内蒙与黑龙江，后来去了吉林，再到辽宁，长子在文革前是沈阳主要干部的一线预备役，给某任市委书记当秘书，结果成了报复重点，文革斗不了他，就斗他大儿子，导致仕途完蛋身体也落病根。</p>

<p>这个人六十年代因为跟上面意见不合就提前退休了，基本没给家里什么好处，纯粹是靠人际关系维持，所以几个子女，除了大女儿和儿子是走的比较靠近仕途外，其他的只有次子和幼子是有这方面发展的。</p>

<p>大女儿嫁给了万里的嫡系，弓长姓氏在铁道部工作过，也可能在外交部有工作过，跟江泽民差不多大，我听说好像今年也去世了，他们家就基本跟这个家族完全没联系，九十年代就基本断联系，因为他们家族主要留在了东北，而大女儿嫁去了北京。</p>

<p>大儿子仕途就固定在沈阳，在公安局工作，很有名望，但就是职务不高，这一点跟他父亲一样。</p>

<p>二儿子性格过于老实巴交，主要在刑警队工作，别人送礼他也不送，就一直没升上去，同期很多人后来都到各省当干部，甚至有人九十年代进了中央，他还是地方一个大队的老刑警。</p>

<p>三儿子是唯一读大学的儿子，听说应该是当时的老红卫兵，去北京被接见的那批，最后也去了北京，不清楚跟他们家的大女儿有多少联系，但应该是有一些的，因为大儿子与大女儿不和，所以主要是靠和事佬的二儿子在中间调解，后来也是在铁道部门待下来的。</p>

<p>二女儿和小女儿最后都留在当地做工人，可能因为年纪太小了，这个人的小女儿比他孙子的年纪都小，可想而知差距，不过他们不重要就不谈了。</p>

<p>这是这家的第二代，看起来平平无奇，但是差异就出在人脉关系上。</p>

<p>大儿子的儿子，也就是这个老干部的长孙的妻族改革开放经商发展起来了，才把这一脉带起来，长孙就比较大院子弟性格，不适合当官，八十年代那种打架都少不了，按现在的话说就是有涉黑，但又不太一样，近似于北京茬架，比较讲规矩的那种，而这个长子是非常看不上儿子的做法，但也管不了，最后实际上是脱离仕途，完全从商了。</p>

<p>二儿子娶的是一个很厉害的农村出身的女人，她父亲是给日本人做翻译，因为偏帮中国人，被发现后用木钉板子打死了，导致她是遗腹子，没读过书吃百家饭长大，靠自己折腾进了当时重工业城市里很重要的一些迎宾机构负责管理，跟孙春兰是同届好友，但这个人吃了没文化的亏，没发展起来，只能混到地方有头有脸，跟长辈一样，只有名声和人脉，没权没钱。</p>

<p>三儿子家里的仕途参与度最高的，可能跟这家的大女儿有比较多的联系，有了关系照顾，所以大女儿家族和三儿子家族都在铁路系统，三儿子家里出了一个军区干部，女儿在铁路系统工作，铁道部整改后没吃挂落，夫妻两个人一直跟习近平外访。</p>

<p>然后重点来了，这个家族里有这么一个特殊情况，这个老干部文革时走动过很多人，认识习仲勋，这家二儿子当年负责给父亲打点家族和友人关系，经常全国到处跑，也就自然认识了习仲勋和他们一家，并且患难时给了很大帮助。</p>

<p>现在这不习近平上台了，老干部家就吃香了，我不清楚他原本知不知道三儿子家的女儿女婿在他随团的名单里（我的判断应该是不知道，后来才知道有这层关系注意到他们家），有可能是副国级干部去他们家做客，就对小孙子说以后我们红色江山就靠你了，到时候好好干，到中央给伯伯做个什么什么的，到时候去哪保送之类的，半开玩笑的口气就说这些话。</p>

<p>而最魔幻的地方在于什么呢？并不是很多人想的那样，A给A照顾，所以A受益。</p>

<p>负责跑来跑去的是二儿子，但这家人太老实，二儿子负责跑，但是没有受任何好处和照顾，完全平民化了，尽管起步点很不错，跟妻子跟孙春兰同期，自己有父亲的人脉关系网，给人家父子跑来跑去，但最后都没有吃到任何好处。</p>

<p>文革时他们有办案小金库，当时没统一公用资金，都是上面睁一只眼闭一只眼的，八几年时地方改制，这个小金库里存了几十万（那时候工资一个月多少，想一下什么概念），钱可以自由支配了，下面的人建议这个二儿子去拿一部分疏通上面关系，带兄弟们一起升上去，剩下的分了。</p>

<p>这个二儿子不干，全交公了。后来有人给他们想办法在美国搞一套房子和办绿卡求办事（我不清楚具体过程和手法），不干不去不办，很轴的一个人，比他晚的后辈有的都当市委书记了，有晋升机会给好处都不要的那种人。</p>

<p>他们家的第三代就落魄了，因为二儿子是最早去世的，导致第三代没来得及继承人脉关系（好像第二代也不热衷这些，他办事就是为亲人朋友，没考虑这些）</p>

<p>到改革开放了，想搞点生意，每次有起色要么被举报，要么有意外，是最早一批在八十年代去深圳的人（可能因为习仲勋的原因），当时在当地搞开发，跟人合作房地产地盘，但也没干下去，被迫家里回体制内，结果又遇到大下岗，落魄了好一段时间，最后是咬咬牙，全家离开了原来的城市，这些年发展起来，有一两个人重新回到中产。</p>

<p>第四代大概也就白领一两万的水平，有一个搞教培，又遇到铁拳了，还有第三代是医生，这几年可想而知，导致第四代旁系有人直接润国外不回来了，这家子嫡亲主心骨只能算很一般。</p>

<p>所以说就很搞笑，这家是文革到改革开放的所有风向都踩到了，辛苦都他们干，人脉关系一个没继承到，但没一个干起来，然后还被中共所有铁拳精准砸到。</p>

<p>也就是说，最后这一家族是靠三儿子的契机，借助原本第一二代累积的关系网，重新发展起来的。</p>

<p>大儿子的后代转向从商，二儿子的后代完全平民化，三儿子的后代重新回到仕途，而且混的相对于他们的出身还很不错。</p>

<p>这样的家族恐怕不在少数，没法统计，名气大到能在互联网出现的名字多数已经算最顶流的了。</p>

<p>比如说他们讲七八十年代，有个老人，不知道姓名身份，就平时负责烧锅炉，什么也不用做，但是逢年过节，市委的书记和各个部门领导都来带礼物问候，就住工作地方的一个小屋子里，待遇很好，也没架子，肯定不是老兵，也无儿女亲戚，他们在那工作的人一直到这个人死都不知道对方身份，反而是死后市委的都来了，省委的人都领导也来了很多。</p>

<p>跟我说这事的人他自己也不确定对方身份，说问他都只是笑呵呵摆摆手就不让谈，但我猜测可能就是跟这些老干部一样，都是名望地位很高，但凑巧一辈子没娶妻生子，或者有一定政治斗争，从一些职级不高实权大的地方掉下来，这样的人太多了。</p>

<p>因此你很难说是一代发展起来还是多代累积，也根本找不到他们在互联网记录里的档案，这是我借机一直想谈的一点。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1966.2</strong> —–2023-01-15 21:37:47+08:00:</p>

<p>我觉得只是大规模移民对他们来说认知革新成本太高了，次子家族后来算半润了，因为认知和教育水平问题，次子家族当时的儿媳有话语权，但她坚持认为去美国的条件不好，表面理由仅仅是那面不说中国话不知道有什么好的，不如去广东这种简单的逻辑。</p>

<p>去年统计公报还没出完整，只到第三季度，所以我用三季度作为参考坐标看一下就知道了。</p>

<p>21年前三季居民收入中位数 22157元，增长8.0% ，城市人口32417元  增长8.0%，农村人口11962元，增长12.3%。</p>

<p>22年前三季居民收入中位数 23277元，增长5.1% ，城市人口33796元，增长4.3%，农村人口12668元，增长5.9% 。</p>

<p>然后看看消费支出：</p>

<p>22年城镇人均消费支出22385元，增长1.8%，扣除价格因素，实际下降0.2%；农村人均消费支出11896元，增长6.4%，扣除价格因素，实际增长4.3%。</p>

<p>衣着消费支出991元，下降1.1%，  教育文化娱乐消费支出1790元，下降4.2%</p>

<p>21年没有下降过，上一次下降是20年，当时比例更大，但情况特殊，22年按道理应该以及封好了，实际却没有预期中的经济活力。</p>

<p>但是21年的规模以上的工业企业利润是高达8.7万亿，对比20年增长34%，可以判断21年全球疫情下常说的订单增长来自于此。</p>

<p>然而到了22年，在清零政策与21年无异的情况下，1-11月，规模以上工业企业利润总额7.71万亿元，同比下降3.6%。</p>

<p>然后再看一组数据：</p>

<p>2017年全国工业企业实现利润总额75187亿元，增速21%</p>

<p>2018年全国工业企业实现利润总额66351亿元，增速10.3%</p>

<p>2019年全国工业企业实现利润总额61995亿元，下降3.3%</p>

<p>也即是说，在疫情之前，国内企业这方面的利润以及触及瓶颈，增长是有限的，很多工业企业除了依赖订单，也依赖国内投资，政府能加大力度投资，这个增长还能拉起来。</p>

<p>从哪能看出来呢？</p>

<p>22年国企利润增长是0.5%，股份制企业利润总额下降2.8%，外商及港澳台商下降7.8%，私营企业下降7.9%。</p>

<p>哪怕21年的增长，也是过去占据大头，这种结构本身就很奇怪，收益他们最高，风险承担与利润下滑也是他们最低。 （而实际上前几年国企利润是在下滑的，并且都下滑时也是他们占大头。）</p>

<p>反过来说，如果当时增长是完全脱离政府行政主导的自然产物，那就无法解释为什么22年又开始下滑。</p>

<p>这只能说明政府短期的鸡血打完以后，利润增长不足的问题就再次显露出来，政府未来肯定还会继续靠债务拉动投资消费的循环，但具体执行细节还需观察。</p>

<p>因为现在企业利润增长的壁垒摆在那，剩下的是给居民收入分配的事项，政府不愿意分出自己的利润，也周转不出安全的资金，这也是为什么近期反复强调第三次分配的原因，包括我一直也在唠叨的直接税改革，政府都想加快推行，他们可能很快就有阶段性政策公布。</p>

<p>但估计要等到政府完全换届后才会公布，而且大概率有一些方案拿出来会很快尝试执行推广，避免给民间反应机会，而在此之前肯定已经有体制内的人收到风声会转移资产或规避。</p>

<p>再看产业就业占比：</p>

<p>从2017年开始，实际上国内的产业改革就一定程度陷入僵化，三级产业制度的比例变化浮动几乎没有。</p>

<p>第三产业占比在2017年是52%，到19和20年一度提高到54%，但是21年下降回53%，从2015年进入50%以后，整体浮动就很小了。</p>

<p>这意味着第三产业能提供的稳定就业岗位增速没有预期的乐观，中共基本维持一个通过剥削第一二产业从业者的模式来维系社会的资源集中供应。</p>

<p>2015年人户分离的人口2.94亿人，其中流动人口2.47亿人 ，基本符合流动人口务工的情况。（人户分离人口指户籍与居住地所在不一，离开超过半年的人口。）</p>

<p>2021年人户分离的人口5.47亿人，其中流动人口3.85亿人 ，中间的差额人口去了哪？</p>

<p>而15年外出农民工是1.68亿人，21年是1.71亿人，本地农民工15年是1.08亿，21年才1.2亿，七年时间，固定地区所需的劳动力增长和供应都很有限，而流动人口暴增（实际上人户分离就算流动人口了，人户分离人口有市辖区之间也算，但不可能本地人口闲着没事天天搬到其他区住半年以上，即便不考虑这点，严格意义的流动人口也大幅度增长。）</p>

<p>这说明更多就业岗位在流向少数地区，城市居住的大量外来人口，包括了非市辖区的大量农村人口，以及城市出身的大量城市人口到其他地方谋生。</p>

<p>庞大的人流量意味着就业需求，住房需求，以及更大的资源挤兑，一定程度上可能会缓解土地财政的压力，但只能说有限度，因为分配制度不公平，买不起就是买不起，实际潜在购房需求的极限，可能就是从人户分离和流动人口之间的差额人口里来寻找。</p>

<p>因为只有不同城市转移定居，且有能力定居下来的人才会就地购房，直接划为流民的农村人口是肯定绝大部分没这个能力的。</p>

<p>而大多数农村人口，也不可能填补农村乡镇的土地财政需求，因为真正意义上的城市始终是少数。</p>

<p>那按道理就可以推算出来，人口较少但行政覆盖大，地方政府多的区域，肯定会出现人口数量不足、消费能力不足，填补不了土地财政需求然后破产的问题，到时候就可以看好戏了。</p>

<p>再有就是扶贫工作，实际上中共做扶贫问题，是把一个经常性开支给剔除了，15年的全国年度统计公报，起码还写了贫困人口5575万人，每年2300元的标准，到21年就不写了 。</p>

<p>最搞笑的地方是15年提到1708万人吃城市低保， 4903万人吃农村低保。</p>

<p>21年直接变成738万人吃城市低保，3474万人吃农村低保。</p>

<p>特困五保户（可以理解为没有自我生存能力的弱势群体），15年是517万人，21年是438万人，我就很好奇到底扶了什么，这个数字真扶贫扩大国家助养一切的比例，不应该按逻辑自然下降（因为很多人没自我生存能力，死亡是随时发生的，下降了就离谱）</p>

<p>再来看看为什么现在考验卷到爆炸，而中层的职业教育体系却建立不起来。</p>

<p>2015年在学研究生191.1万人，毕业生55.2万人。</p>

<p>2022年在学研究生333.2万人，毕业生77.3万人。</p>

<p>2015年中等职业教育招生601.2万人，在校生1656.7万人，毕业生567.9万人。</p>

<p>2022年中等职业教育招生656.2万人，在校生1738.5万人，毕业生484.1万人。</p>

<p>研究生卷到爆炸，疯狂对市场输出，要是曲看招生人数是扩招近一倍，反而人口数量最多的职业教育体系，就扩那么一点，结果毕业的反而减少。</p>

<p>在我看来这是给社会制造不稳定的大炸弹，一方面产业升级需要高等教育的学生，另一方面技工劳动力又迫切需求大量的职业教育毕业生，现在政府是不给中间输血，反而拼命卷高层，然后对基层放养，变相打压（不够门槛读高等教育的农村子弟，但社会又没给他渠道读成熟的职业教育，那就只能作为人矿和厂里的螺丝钉了）</p>

<p>这意味着未来社会会极度分化，不会有一个收入相对较高的蓝领技工阶层作为中和，没有给基层通过这一渠道有良好生活的可能，大量错过学习年老的基层人口，到一定年龄后就会形成庞大的就业和社会问题。</p>

<p>而对大多数通过高等教育和卷研究生成为白领，再到中产阶级的大学生们来说，即便中共下台，产业升级的上限得以开启，他们也只有少数人能在有限的升级岗位里脱颖而出，因为同期人数过多，如果中共还坚持现有的劳动和企业政策，那就是两头堵，中产和基层谁都别想好过。</p>

<p>反而是有一定熟练技巧的专业技术工种，因为相对人数较少，会伴随未来社会的消费类型转为内需，成为比较吃香的劳动力，但是这东西毕竟看技术不看证书，基层没受高等教育和职业教育的人也是有可能转化的，反而是高等教育的大学生们很难向下转化，因此该领域的人士可能在早期会比较吃香，后面也要面临竞争。</p>

<p>这是大概粗略的随讲，还没做更细致的。</p>

<p>下面有提到</p>

<h3 id="1970-中國失去取字傳統是否可惜-submitted-on-2023-01-15-2315580800">1970: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/real_China_irl/comments/10cm84f/中國失去取字傳統是否可惜/">中國失去取字傳統是否可惜？</a>, submitted on 2023-01-15 23:15:58+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>1970.1</strong> —–2023-01-16 01:19:49+08:00:</p>

<p>表字与谥号其实都是可以现代化改造的传统文化，最主要的是即便没了这些，现代也有各种无法统一的方式去表述，表字的习惯消退其实一定程度反而导致一些父母乱取名，重复或听上去就跟克隆人一样的命名率极高，每年都有人统计，什么梓涵、梓潼之类的。</p>

<p>而很多时候家庭或友人称呼，也多会起个小名，在学校也会有花名，所以说这种称呼的代用其实是无法避免的，不如自己决定，在学校或外面如果直呼姓名，可以体现距离，能叫得出表字的，也能明白关系远近。</p>

<p>过去是因为社会有礼法制度约束，现代社会则更多是用来方便社交，区分法定姓名与社交姓名，是人对自我的定义，而不是社会对人的定义。</p>

<p>每个人都肯定希望自己对自己有定义，因此古人还会给自己取号，都是对自我的进一步解释。</p>

<p>还有例如谥号，尽管名义是没有了，但实际上在中共对去世高干的陈述定评里，还是会有变体出现，所以这些东西我觉得整体文化氛围下是有市场的，你不管它未必会多兴盛，但你稍微催一下，就有可能恢复一些。</p>

<p>现代社会的文化面貌很大程度都来自于五四运动后，精神面貌上就是破除旧社会遗漏，拥抱新文化生活，但是如果未来再进一步发展，脱离了原来的政治惯性，可能又会稍微回归传统，国内说想恢复表字的人跟汉服运动其实凑在一起也挺多，不过中共是肯定不会做这件事的。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-09~2023-01-15的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-15/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-09~2023-01-15的言论" /><published>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-15/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-15/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1041.1</strong> —–2023-01-10 10:48:58+08:00:</p>

<p>Thanks for the link /u/Dirish. For what it’s worth, at this point I personally think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtU_M0Sjd9Y">Mia Mulder’s video on Tartaria</a>, which is based on far more research than I’ve ever done, more than supersedes my old post. The main thing is that Tartaria as it existed even then is not a single narrative so much as a super-narrative that unites three separate conspiracy narratives:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The ‘Cultural Layer’ (i.e. the idea that a global ‘mudflood’ raised ground level in large parts of the world simultaneously, hence explaining buildings with windows below street level).</li>
  <li>‘Tartaria’ in Early Modern geographies (i.e. failing to recognise the use of ‘Tartaria’ as a generic regional designate and not as a state entity).</li>
  <li>Architectural anti-modernism (i.e. declaring any pre-modernist architecture to be essentially stylistically cogent).</li>
</ol>

<p>My post covers only the second of these but Mulder does all three.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1042.1</strong> —–2023-01-10 16:32:16+08:00:</p>

<p>The short answer is there isn’t one. The mid-length answer is that the definition is invariably a contextual one. The long answer is below.</p>

<p>To begin with, historians who deal with issues of identity will generally be a lot more precise in their terminology than those who do not, and there are certain subfields of Chinese history where such issues are generally not brought up – even though they could be. This absence is most keenly felt in 20th century history, where, especially post-Qing, most histories will sort of elide the definition of Chinese nationhood – crack open any standard history of the Second Sino-Japanese War like Rana Mitter’s <em>Forgotten Ally</em> or Hans van de Ven’s <em>China at War</em>, and you will find near-total silence on the matter of minority groups. Arguably, such works do, by implication, buy into the sorts of supraethnic national definition you describe. Historians of Imperial China may use ‘Chinese’ quite casually in place of ‘Han’ when discussing issues that are, in general, relevant specifically to the Han. For instance if someone is talking about ‘Chinese religion’, you can be pretty sure they only mean Han Chinese practices, not Tibetan or Zhuang or Miao. In both cases, historians are essentially reading ‘with the grain’ of the contemporary evidence, using definitions of ‘Chinese’ that are based on generally contemporary understandings. However, there is a difference in that the definition being derived from is not always consistent: ‘Chinese’ in the imperial context generally is used to translate the cultural label of ‘Han’, whereas ‘Chinese’ in a post-imperial context usually is used to translate the <em>national</em> label of ‘Chinese’ as used by the ROC and PRC in their respective periods. And then a separate set of priorities applies for historians of Chinese diasporas, whose subjects were mostly Han and who thus probably do not need to differentiate between peoples who were not Han but still ‘Chinese’ by some label or another.</p>

<p>None of these uses are unproblematic, and they reflect an underlying issue that there is no word in any Sinitic language that maps directly onto ‘Chinese’, whose use in English encompasses a variety of ideas. <em>Zhongguoren</em> carries an implicit character of nationality, but also more specifically of statehood – i.e. a <em>Zhongguoren</em> is one who is identified as being a citizen or subject of a state recognised as being <em>Zhongguo</em>. <em>Huaren</em> is somewhat ethnic, somewhat cultural, and generally carries the connotation of either just the Han, or the wider group of peoples who follow Han cultural norms. And you also have <em>Hanren</em>, a narrower ethnic term specifically denoting Han Chinese. So you could have a situation where a Hui person may be a <em>Zhongguoren</em> by political definition, possibly a <em>Huaren</em> by genealogical but not by cultural definition, and definitively not a <em>Hanren</em> by ethnic definition. On the other hand, a diaspora Han Chinese person would be a <em>Huaren</em> and a <em>Hanren</em>, but not a <em>Zhongguoren</em> unless they specifically affirmed said nationality. Yet all three of these might be used to mean ‘Chinese’ in a given context: to a political historian ‘Chinese’ may map most closely onto <em>Zhongguoren</em> in the sense of a subject of the state; for a cultural historian ‘Chinese’ may map mainly onto <em>Huaren</em> as a term denoting a broad cultural group; for a historian of identity discourses, ‘Chinese’ may map mainly onto <em>Hanren</em> as a convenient synonym to distinguish them from steppe nomadic peoples, tribal groups in the Southeast Asian uplands, and so on.</p>

<p>While Qing specialists in particular have often advocated a certain greater specificity of language in these matters, standards are not always consistent, and the term ‘Chinese’ often creeps through. All three of the above ways of using the term can be found in key works on Qing history like Pamela Crossley’s <em>A Translucent Mirror</em> or Peter Perdue’s <em>China Marches West</em> – ‘Chinese’ to mean subjects of a ‘Chinese’ state, ‘Chinese’ to refer to those in a particular cultural tradition, and ‘Chinese’ as synonym for ‘Han’. Now, in general, these historians would agree that peoples who are defined as part of a Chinese nation <em>now</em> were not Chinese for all time: it makes no sense to speak of 12th century Mongols, 16th century Jurchens, or 18th century Tibetans as ‘Chinese’ in any meaningful way. But then there ends up being the question of where such peoples fit. If we agree that we cannot impose a ‘Chinese’ label on societies that were not part of a ‘Chinese’ empire at the time, then how do we avoid the pitfall of only ever discussing them in the context of ‘Chinese’ history? We can agree that the Mongols enter the narrative of Chinese history after their attacks on Western Xia began on 1205, but what about beforehand? How should we discuss the pre-Qing history of what we <em>now</em> call Manchuria, especially when ‘Manchuria’ itself is an 18th century neologism, significantly postdating the formation of the Qing empire? In other words, how can we avoid replacing one Sinocentric narrative (that of the modern Chinese nation back-projected through time) with another (in which ‘China’ is acknowledged as historically contingent, but nevertheless the central object of consideration)?</p>

<p>One approach is that of Evelyn Rawski, rooted in the approaches pioneered by global history, which is to think about the wider East Asian region in terms of interconnectivity and simultaneity rather than purely in terms of proto-national narratives. At the extreme end, this could mean discarding the very notion of ‘Chinese history’ altogether in favour of a more broadly ‘Asian’ history in which statehood and the boundaries imposed by states are acknowledged, but not allowed to posthumously impose those same limits on historical study. This doesn’t fix the problem of defining ‘Chineseness’ however: variation and contrast are just as important as commonality here, and it is still important to speak of distinctions between, say, ‘Chinese’, ‘Korean, and ‘Japanese’ contexts within an ‘(East) Asian’ whole. We could take some cues from Dominic Lieven, who, drawing on work by Peter Perdue, offers an alternative definition of ‘China’ itself, as really being a collective term for a shifting series of states claiming common political traditions and genealogies of statehood. ‘Chineseness’, in turn, is affirmed as specifically defined via statehood – and especially of <em>imperial</em> statehood – and thus expanding and contracting in its definition over time, as empires expanded and contracted, and as they exerted and discarded claims to the credentials of ‘Chinese’ statehood. Indeed, in my view the use of ‘Chinese’ to very specifically refer to concepts linked to the narratives of a dominant state entity is probably the most intellectually consistent approach that can be taken, given the extreme fluidity of identity constructs below the state level.</p>

<p>So in the end, no, historians don’t really have a single consistent definition of who ‘Chinese people’ are. In a best-case scenario they will at least try to define the term in question, but in general, ‘Chinese’ is genuinely used in a variety of ways that are <em>usually</em> understood to be based on some kind of relevant, period-specific conception. There have, of course, been attempts to problematise the use of ‘Chinese’: Prasenjit Duara’s <em>Rescuing History from the Nation</em>, Pamela Crossley’s <em>The Wobbling Pivot</em>, and Peter Perdue’s review essay ‘Classical China: A Singular Entity’ have all done so. But the very word ‘Chinese’ is essentially so fundamental to the field – and interest still so relatively modern-skewed, to periods including the present where simple definitions of ‘Chinese’ are often peddled but rarely questioned – that efforts at its problematisation will likely continue for some while yet.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1042.2</strong> —–2023-01-10 23:46:59+08:00:</p>

<p>Gosh, a lot of follow-ups. I’ll try to address them as best I can.</p>

<p>As regards the ‘foreignness’ of the Manchus under the Qing, I would agree with the notion that we cannot use any definition of ‘Chinese’ other than the simple political one (i.e. ‘China’ as a shorthand for the Qing and any Qing subject as ‘Chinese’ as a result) to encompass the Qing-era Manchus. Simply put, Qing-era Manchus consciously identified as non-Han and as having, at minimum, a genealogical basis for seeing themselves as separate from the Han as a people. The assertion of an essential non-Chineseness on the Manchus’ part is thus correct insofar as the Manchus themselves accepted this notion. However, we still ought to bear in mind a certain – but far from total – degree of acculturation among the Manchus, whose prolonged contact with Chinese urbanism combined with state attempts to promulgate an idealised ‘Manchu Way’ to produce a unique synthesis of Chinese and Northeast Asian cultural norms.</p>

<p>As for multiethnic vs ‘mono-ethnic’ states, I think we simply need to recognise that the notion of an ethnostate is pretty recent in world history, and that most societies have acknowledged – if not necessarily readily embraced – a certain degree of internal pluralism. You can come up with any number of examples of fuzzy edges when it comes to identity definitions: ‘the English’ is perhaps the most standard example, where colloquial uses have often encompassed basically the entirety of the British Isles, but even at less extreme stretches, you have fuzzy zones like the Cornish. Some would make the argument that a singular Japanese national (or at times racial) identity encompassing east and west didn’t really come into being until the later Edo period. The simple fact is that any demonym is going to change over time in terms of its possible bases and consequent breadth.</p>

<p>I think dwelling on Lieven here will take us rather off topic: I should have specified that the work by Lieven I’m referring to is his recent popular press book <em>In the Shadow of the Gods: The Emperor in World History</em>, which is largely a work of synthesis discussing emperors (and empress regnants) across some 14 case studies; three of these concern China. Lieven is, however, mainly a historian of Russia. His focus on China is a result of it being one of the more long-lasting, or at least genealogically contiguous, examples of an imperial tradition of Eurasian history. Within that broader study of emperorship, Lieven takes the classic line that nationhood and empire are anathema, but he does argue that China is an unusual case where the imperial polity has been held together through attempts to enforce a national identity within its borders. But again, we need to regard Lieven’s interpretation of China as one framed through his particular read of secondary sources (which exactly I have not checked), and while he’s definitely a decent historian he’s not a China specialist. Nor does he really engage with the empires not generally considered part of the ‘canon’ of succession.</p>

<p>As for how to approach the Liao or Qara Khitai (or Western Xia for that matter), there’s a couple of ways to go about it. Competing imperial claims could be the basis for arguing for the existence of multiple competing Chinas. Or we can use ‘China’ in geographical terms and refer to any state significantly occupying part of it as being ‘Chinese’ – something that would probably exclude Qara Khitai (which was located primarily in what is now Xinjiang) but not Western Xia (which ruled mainly over Han subjects in Gansu). But there are approaches that may still accept the notion of a single primary ‘China’ while heavily qualifying it: Morris Rossabi frames what is sometimes termed the ‘Song-Liao-Jin period’ as ‘China Among Equals’, a period in which claimants to the Chinese imperial mantle were at odds and unable to decisively overcome each other, and in which therefore the notional ‘China’ (i.e. the Song) was unable to actually consider itself an all-encompassing entity.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1042.3</strong> —–2023-01-13 20:44:43+08:00:</p>

<p>There are quite a few valid questions here but they’re a bit tangled. You actually caught me out here – I’d forgotten the breadth of the Tangut empire, and so the Tanguts definitely ruled over more than just Han. But the fact that the Tanguts continued to exist would not inherently prevent them from having mostly Han subjects – the same is true of Manchu after all. Secondly, the southern states are considered more ‘Han’ because they were ruled by Han rulers and their subjects were defined as such, despite, as you are aware, being a mix of Han settlers and the descendants of indigenous peoples, but many such peoples (though far from all) had, through the processes of Han colonisation, been subsumed into that coloniser population. Those indigenous groups that did not become assimilated (whether forcibly or by choice) into a wider Han milieu often existed in highly autonomous polities whose subjection to ‘Chinese’ states was largely nominal.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, ‘Xizang’ originated as a phonetic transliteration of Ü-Tsang.

<p>Hi! Thanks for coming to do this AMA with us. This is a question that is perhaps a little fuzzy and philosophical, but do you think myth has a place in the public view of history? Can there be, for lack of a better word, ‘positive’ myths, or is the nature of myth such that all myths are irretrievably problematic, even if to varying degrees? I ask because I’m reminded a bit of Paul A. Cohen’s <em>History in Three Keys</em>, which simultaneously acknowledges myth as a valid sort of historical discourse, while condemning presentist mythologising, at least in the case of the Boxers. I will confess my recall of Cohen’s theory in the book is by now a tad fuzzy, so apologies for any incoherence.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1051.1</strong> —–2023-01-14 00:04:50+08:00:</p>

<p>You’ve asked this question at a good time, because not only is the answer ‘absolutely’, but I’ve also been working on <a href="https://imgur.com/o2eUw3f">a map (WIP)</a> illustrating the breadth of regions that underwent significant uprisings between 1850 and 1880, as well as territorial changes and foreign attacks. At present, there isn’t really any scholarship, at least in English, that attempts to approach all of these holistically; instead, usually historians focus on a single uprising in relative isolation. As such, treat any statements I make about contextualisation as distinctly my own.</p>

<p>A short list of the more significant revolts of this period are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Khwaja revolts (?1826-1863?) – note: this is an <em>extremely</em> complicated set of events with start and end dates <em>very</em> difficult to define.</li>
  <li>The Taiping War (1851-64/6)</li>
  <li>The Nian Rebellion (1851-68)</li>
  <li>The Small Sword Uprising (1853)</li>
  <li>Wu Lingyun’s rebellion (1852?-1869) (successor entities active in Viet Nam until 1887)</li>
  <li>The Red Turban Rebellion (1854-6) (and its successor entity, the Kingdom of Dacheng (1856-64))</li>
  <li>The ‘Miao’ Rebellion (1854-73)</li>
  <li>The Yunnanese Revolt, a.k.a. the ‘Panthay’ Rebellion (1856-73)</li>
  <li>The ‘Dungan’ Hui Revolt, a.k.a. the Northwest Muslim Rebellion (1862-75)</li>
  <li>The Xinjiang Revolt (1863-77)</li>
</ul>

<p>These revolts all happened for somewhat different reasons, and they can be classified in many different ways. I will make it easy for myself and classify them solely by periodisation, because as you can see, there seem to have been two pretty discrete ‘waves’ of revolt.</p>

<h3 id="waves-of-revolt">‘Waves’ of Revolt</h3>

<p>From the above descriptions it should be reasonably clear that the major rebellions began in two particular periods: 1851-6, and 1862-3. The former period saw uprisings all across China proper, but not within the broader realms of the Qing empire. Their membership tended to cohere around socially marginalised groups, but this was not an absolute given, and in many instances the rebel groups tended to be either multiethnic or Han-centric, reflecting the majority makeups of their particular regions of origin. By contrast, the 1862-3 wave only involved the northwest of the Qing empire – northwestern China and Xinjiang, a.k.a. East Turkestan – and involved Muslim groups exclusively, rather than the more federative entities that had been in revolt in China proper. Now, there is an obvious outlier to this two-wave model, and that is the Khwaja revolts in Xinjiang. These I have included because <em>technically</em> the Afaqiyya Khwajas had been attempting to spark an uprising in the Tarim Basin since the 1820s, but they were only successful in mobilising local support in 1826, 1847, and 1857, so it is very hard to say where in the chronology it all fits. So I won’t – it is essentially the exception that exists outside the rule.</p>

<p>Why exactly Gansu, Shaanxi and Xinjiang did not rebel sooner is an interesting question. That the Arrow War, in which Britain and France fought the Qing for increased trading privileges, occurred in 1856-60 is surely pure coincidence given the regions’ distance from the coast. One argument would be that tensions had been slowly ramping up across the empire for a while, but that the northwest had been insulated from the initial wave of uprisings, and the spark was only really lit in 1862. This was when the arrival of Taiping splinter forces in Sichuan and the increasing westward movements of the Nian led to an intensification of local militarisation, frictions from which led to uprisings in Shaanxi, followed by support in Gansu, and followed in turn by Sinophone Hui Muslims in Xinjiang rising in solidarity and creating an opening for the Turkic uprisings and subsequent Kokandi intervention. I’m largely willing to accept this narrative in the absence of an alternative: I see no particular reason why a Muslim uprising <em>should</em> have begun in the early 1850s without some kind of major spark.</p>

<p>Below, I’ll give a potted summary of each revolt along with recommended reading, as there is frankly a <em>lot</em> of ground to cover.</p>

<h3 id="summaries">Summaries</h3>

<h4 id="the-khwaja-rebellions-and-the-xinjiang-revolt-1826-1877">The Khwaja rebellions and the Xinjiang Revolt (1826-1877)</h4>

<p>Qing rule over the Turkic Muslims of the Tarim Basin had never been entirely stable, especially thanks to the influence of the Naqshbandiyya Sufi movement, which underwent a schism into two rival splinters: the ‘Black Hats’ (or Ishaqiyya) and ‘White Hats’ (or Afaqiyya). The Ishaqiyya ingratiated themselves with the Qing, but the Afaqiyya became a locus for anti-Qing resistance, with their religious leaders (Khwajas), operating out of exile in neighbouring Kokand, attempting repeatedly to foment an uprising that would drive the Qing from the region. This reached its apex in 1826 with the revolt of Jahangir Khwaja, who remained at large for the next two years; the next successful uprising in 1847, known (for unclear reasons) as the ‘Seven Khwajas Uprising’, lasted some three months; subsequent incursions failed to ignite popular support until 1857, when Wali Khan managed to gain control of Kashgar, funnily enough also for three months. Continued attempts to foment uprisings failed, and the next major revolt started without the Khwajas in 1863.</p>

<p>The Xinjiang revolt that began in 1863 and culminated in Yaqub Beg’s enthronement in Kashgar was an extremely confused affair. While initiated by Hui communities acting in solidarity with the emerging revolts in northwest China, this in turn prompted Turkic uprisings in solidarity with the Hui, while being largely disconnected from the earlier attempts at rabble-rousing by the Afaqiyya clerics. The Kokandi military intervention led by Yaqub Beg was nominally in support of Buzurg Khan’s claim as the latest Afaqi Khwaja, but Buzurg was very rapidly sidelined, especially as the military collapse of Kokand to Russia over the course of 1864-8 essentially meant Yaqub Beg no longer had a superior he needed to answer to (that said, he did declare submission to the Ottoman Empire, so he didn’t exactly consider that kind of arrangement to be anathema). Hodong Kim argues, however, that by the time of Yaqub’s death, his support base was still very much a composite one, with the former Kokandi army, the Afaqiyya sect, and the more ‘organic’ rebel movement constituting distinct components of the Kashgar Emirate, which then fractured following Yaqub’s death in May 1877.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="the-taiping-war-1851-64">The Taiping War (1851-64)</h4>

<p>This probably needs little introduction. Centred on a new religious movement based on Protestant Christianity that proclaimed the rejection of almost all of China’s post-Zhou religious traditions in favour of a return to an imagined pre-Confucian monotheism, the Taiping were probably the most serious existential threat to the Qing until the 1911 Revolution. At their height they controlled large parts of Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Zhejiang, some of China’s wealthiest provinces, as well as making incursions into several other regions at various points – the most long-lasting of these being Shi Dakai’s campaign into Sichuan from 1856 to 1863.</p>

<p>Readings:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="the-nian-1851-68">The Nian (1851-68)</h4>

<p>Essentially a super-confederation of bandit gangs in northern China, the Nian eventually had a stranglehold on the lower Yellow River and bested several Qing armies. At their height ca. 1865, a Nian army under the leadership of ex-Taiping general Lai Wenguang made it to the gates of Beijing, but failed to prosecute the siege effectively and were ultimately driven off. The Nian were not a particularly ideological movement and seem to have had few ambitions for serious political change, except, perhaps, for Lai Wenguang himself, and have tended to be considered more as an opportunistic raiding entity than as a contender for power.</p>

<p>Readings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elizabeth Perry, <em>Rebels and Revolutionaries in North China</em> (1980) – A relatively materialist treatment of the Nian, but still the most recent in English.</li>
  <li>Teng Ssu-Yu, <em>The Nien Army and their Guerrilla Warfare</em> (1961) – Very old by now, but a decent chronological treatment of the Nian uprising.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-small-sword-uprising-1853">The Small Sword Uprising (1853)</h4>

<p>A roughly nine-month takeover of Shanghai by secret societies in the city, predominantly consisting of Guangdong and Fujian migrants. While a relative footnote in the wider context of the Qing, this was a significant moment in Shanghai urban history, particularly for the International Settlement.</p>

<p>Readings:</p>

<h4 id="wu-lingyuns-rebellion-1852-1869-and-the-kingdom-of-yanling-1861-1869">Wu Lingyun’s Rebellion (1852?-1869?) and the Kingdom of Yanling (1861-1869?)</h4>

<p>The case of Wu Lingyun is a tricky one. All told, it is probably better to consider Wu Lingyun as a bandit lord with pretensions to Taiping connections, rather than a committed contender for either regional separatism or dynastic renewal, even if he did proclaim the existence of a Kingdom of Yanling after 1861. Unusually, Wu Lingyun’s rebellion was one that would ultimately cross state boundaries. After Wu died in 1863 he was succeeded by his son, Wu Yazhong, who presided over a three-way schism in Yanling in 1865, which saw two major splinters form: the Black Flag Army under Liu Yongfu and the Yellow Flag Army under Pan Lunsi, both of which then moved into northern Viet Nam. These two forces then joined opposite sides of the White Flag uprising by local indigenous groups, with the Yellow Flags joining the rebels while the Black Flags supported the Vietnamese government. After fleeing China in 1868, Wu Yazhong began attacking Vietnamese towns, but was rounded up and executed in 1869. The Yellow Flags began cooperating with the French, but broke up after Qing, Vietnamese, and Black Flag forces defeated Pan Lunsi and executed him in 1877. The Black Flags, in turn, were formally disbanded after the Sino-French War in 1885, although elements remained at large until at least 1887, and former members continued to organise low-level anti-French insurgency.</p>

<p>Readings:</p>

  <li>Ella S. Laffey, ‘In the Wake of the Taipings: Some Patterns of Local Revolt in Kwangsi Province, 1850-1875’, <em>Modern Asian Studies</em> 10:1 (1976) – A discussion mainly of Yanling, written as part of an ultimately uncompleted project on Liu Yongfu.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-red-turban-rebellion-1854-6">The Red Turban Rebellion (1854-6)</h4>

<p>An uprising of secret society elements in Guangdong, predominantly Cantonese-speaking Puntis with a particular enmity for the Hakkas, that nearly seized Guangzhou but ultimately never did. Splinters of the Red Turbans later formed the Kingdom of Dacheng in Guiping, essentially in what had been the old Taiping base area, although information on that is sparse, at least in English.</p>

<p>Readings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frederic Wakeman, <em>Strangers at the Gate</em> (1967) – Includes a 12-page narrative of the Red Turbans, albeit one rooted in the view that social change in the region was driven primarily by European contact.</li>
  <li>J Y Wong, <em>Yeh Ming-Ch’en: Viceroy of Liang Kuang 1852-8</em> (1976) – A semi-biographical account of the later career of Ye Mingchen, head of the Guangdong and Guangxi viceroyal government at the time of the Red Turban Rebellion and the Arrow War.</li>
  <li>Jaeyoon Kim, ‘The Heaven and Earth Society and the Red Turban Rebellion in Late Qing China,’ <em>Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences</em> 3 (2009) – Not the most fantastic of articles, but still the most recent treatment of the Red Turbans in English.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-miao-rebellion">The ‘Miao’ Rebellion</h4>

<p>This gets so little treatment and so little interest that despite the existence of a full monograph on it, I have not read more than a page or two, so I’ll skip straight to the reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Robert D. Jenks, <em>Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou: The “Miao” Rebellion 1854–1873</em> (1996) – A key takeaway here is that the scare quotes do matter: the Qing officially regarded this as an indigenous revolt when in reality there was a much more multiethnic character to it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-yunnanese-revolt">The Yunnanese Revolt</h4>

<p>Another one of those messy ones. Low-level violence had been ongoing in Yunnan for decades, but did not boil over into outright rejections of Qing government authority until 1856. Yunnan’s rebel leadership were predominantly Hui Muslims, but also included indigenous and Han followers to a considerable extent and even a few Manchus, at least in the Pingnan Guo (aka the Dali Sultanate). But not all Hui Muslims stood against the Qing consistently: Ma Rulong, originally one of the rebels, eventually defected to the Qing and led his Muslim forces against Du Wenxiu in Dali. Ultimately, however, the Yunnanese revolt would be settled not as an infight between Hui leaders but rather a direct Qing military campaign under Cen Yuying.</p>

<ul>
  <li>David G. Atwill, <em>The Chinese Sultanate</em> (2005) – The definitive history of the Yunnanese uprisings.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-dungan-hui-revolt-1862-75">The ‘Dungan’ Hui Revolt (1862-75)</h4>

<p>This was probably the least centralised of all the major uprisings, being less of a case of community violence between Hui and Han in Gansu and Shaanxi that only gradually saw the coalescences of larger formations like the Gansu ‘Big Battalions’. After his failed attack on Beijing in 1865, Lai Wenguang had ambitions of linking up with the northwestern Muslims, but this never came to fruition; in any event, it’s not really clear that the rebels had much of a clear goal beyond the immediate one of ensuring their survival against Han Chinese militias.</p>

<p>Readings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jonathan Lipman, <em>Familiar Strangers</em> (1997) – A general history of the Hui of northwest China, but basically the only good account of the ‘Dungan’ revolt in English is in here.</li>
  <li>Kenneth Swope, ‘General Zuo’s counter-insurgency doctrine’, <em>Small Wars and Insurgencies</em> 30:4 (2019) – A somewhat problematic account of the career of Zuo Zongtang, but a decent enough chronology of Qing rebel suppression in the place and period.</li>

<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we’re letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as ‘Why didn’t X do Y’ relatively often don’t get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, ‘why didn’t X do Y’ questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It’s worth remembering that people in the past couldn’t see into the future, and they generally didn’t have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn’t necessarily look that way at the time.</p>

<p>If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/">consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen</a> (rather than why what didn’t happen didn’t happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Reading the Marble Machine X subreddit is fascinating; I don’t think I’ve ever seen Reddit posts so consistently ‘ratioed’. Every new upload there’s half a dozen upvotes and a few dozen comments and it’s just the same few competing opinions over and over within a general air of bewilderment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Martin has lost the plot and isn’t going to have a finished machine;</li>
  <li>Martin is going to have a finished machine but it won’t be what anyone actually wants; or</li>
  <li>Martin will deliver, but he’ll take time to get there.</li>
</ul>

<p>IMO he’s never going to finish this thing and it’s simply taken him too long to get here as it is. Marble Machine 1 went viral nearly <em>seven years ago</em> in March 2016, having taken about 16 months to go from build to video. MMX was scrapped in September 2021, having begun development in January 2017 – that’s 57 months of wasted time. He could have redesigned and rebuilt the original Marble Machine <em>three and a half times over</em> in the time that he finish building the MMX. The way it stands, it’s looking like <em>Synecdoche: New York</em> levels of life-consuming unfinishedness. I’ve seen the odd comparison to Yandere Simulator, but you know what Yandere Simulator has consistently had that MMX hasn’t? Functional, accessible builds that have been iterated on, however slowly, and not a singular integrated device whose creator is too much of a perfectionist to be willing to complete, even in rough form.</p>

<p><strong>From Ivo H. Daalder and James Goldgeier:</strong> “So far, Washington and its allies have appropriately focused on the immediate task of helping Ukraine and avoiding escalation. But there is a pressing need to consider the longer term, and to develop policies towards both Russia and Ukraine based on the emerging reality that this war is likely to continue for quite some time. Rather than assuming that the war can be ended through triumph or talks, the West needs to contemplate a world in which the conflict continues with neither victory nor peace in sight. In such a world, the United States and its allies will need to continue providing Ukraine with military support to defend against further Russian aggression. They will need to contain Russia’s larger ambitions by maintaining economic sanctions and isolating Moscow diplomatically. And they will need to ensure that the conflict does not escalate.  At the same time, they will need to lay a long-term basis for security and stability in Europe. That will require integrating Ukraine fully into the West while forging a containment policy that emphasizes both deterrence of Russian aggression and efforts to engage Moscow to avoid the escalation of the war to a broader military confrontation that no one wants. Balancing a Ukraine policy with a Russia policy will be challenging over the long-term, but both endeavors will be essential to the future of European security.”</p>

<p>—– <strong>334.1</strong> —–2023-01-12 22:26:11+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From James K. Sebenius and Michael Singh:</strong> “In October 2022, progressive Democrats in the U.S. Congress sparked an uproar by releasing a letter urging President Joe Biden to pursue negotiations with Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine. The signatories called for a “proactive diplomatic push . . . to seek a realistic framework for a ceasefire.” The letter was quickly retracted and its release blamed on a staffing error. But the following month, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, repeated the call for Ukraine to “seize the moment” and negotiate, arguing that Kyiv was unlikely to make further military gains for the foreseeable future. Supporters of Ukraine reacted furiously, asserting that negotiations inevitably meant compromise with—and thus victory for—Russia.</p>

<p>But asking whether negotiations are good or bad misses the point. Negotiations are merely a tool, and like any tool, are useful insofar as they can advance interests and lead to preferred outcomes. The better question, therefore, is, Can negotiating lead to a better result for the United States and Ukraine than not negotiating?</p>

<p>Right now, the answer is still no. No deal is possible between a Ukraine that is making steady battlefield progress and a Russia in denial of this reality. Even calling for talks today risks benefiting Moscow. But this impasse need not be permanent. By keeping up pressure on Russia, Ukraine and its partners in the West can begin to create the conditions for negotiations to succeed.”</p>

<p><strong>From Christopher Johnstone:</strong> “Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on January 13 will provide a crucial opportunity to turn the page on decades of history in Japan’s security relationship with the United States. In mid-December, Kishida announced a new national security and defense strategy that departs from the path Japan has followed since World War II. The plan calls for Japan to increase defense spending by nearly 60 percent over five years, shattering the informal cap of one percent of GDP that has been in place since the 1970s. Japan will also acquire military capabilities it has long foresworn—in particular “counterstrike” missiles, or long-range precision weapons that will be mounted on vehicles, aircraft, ships, and eventually submarines. These will likely include U.S. Tomahawk land attack missiles, which Washington is preparing to sell to Tokyo. Japan will also heavily invest in cyber-capabilities, unmanned systems, and satellites that can support counterstrike operations. Tokyo has signaled that it intends to move quickly: Just a week later, the Kishida government unveiled a 6.8 trillion yen (about $51 billion) defense budget request for the next fiscal year, a 25 percent increase over the current year.</p>

<p>Once implemented, Japan’s strategy will transform the country’s place in the international security order. The prospect of a better-armed and equipped Japan will complicate North Korea and China’s calculations. But to maximize the effectiveness of Japan’s new posture, the country’s alliance with the United States must evolve. Today it is strong, but it falls short of a true military partnership capable of mounting integrated operations at short notice. As Japan pursues its new vision, the two close allies need a new command and control architecture, far deeper levels of information-sharing, and expanded cooperation between their defense industries. It is also time to revisit the cost-sharing arrangement that has long supported the U.S. military presence in Japan.”</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-02~2023-01-08的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-08/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2023-01-02~2023-01-08的言论" /><published>2023-01-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-08/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-08/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>ID isn’t much EU-friendlier than North America-based talents; the time gap is about the same but in the opposite direction, and not everyone has Kaela’s insane work ‘ethic’ where they essentially stream 24/7. I’ve been able to catch Zeta a lot but that’s because I’m on a university student’s schedule and have relatively high flexibility.</p>

<p>And it’s also not universally the case that ID is essentially an EN extension – I know Zeta, Reine, and to a great extent Ollie to be relatively EN-heavy, but on the other hand you have relatively Bahasa-heavy members like Kobo and Iofi. I’ve not watched enough of Moona, Risu, Anya, or Kaela to really get a strong sense of language balance there. On a related note it’s not implausible that those with stronger accents get passed over a bit, either (more accusatorily) because of some level of prejudice, or (more charitably) because it can require a little more attention to hear them properly. An added element is that some may be thrown off by the presence of any significant stretch of non-English language use and would prefer to be able to grasp the stream as a whole, but given IRyS’ popularity despite her relative bilinguality, that may not be the case – or viewers tolerate Japanese more.</p>

<p>Then we have to throw in the mix that collabs within HoloID are basically non-English even between the English-heavy members. If part of the draw of following a particular agency streamer is also the prospect of their bouncing off other members of the same agency relatively frequently, then it can be a little frustrating if those interactions are basically never in your language.</p>

<p>It’s also misleading to look at the r/hololive portion of the fandom and presume that the wider fandom is necessarily of similar mind. I rarely see much in the way of ID engagement by EN viewers on Twitter, and I suspect that anyone who is a relatively passive viewer, only really engaging via Youtube and not as active in fandom spaces, will a) not see much reason to click on a streamer with ‘hololive-ID’ prominently displayed, and b) may well not be recommended HoloID streamers by the algorithm.</p>

<p>So I don’t doubt there’s probably aspects of ‘exoticism’/racism/lighter prejudice involved, but there’s a few practicalities to it too, which is unfortunate because Zeta is great and everyone should watch her we are not a cult #ZETANISM2023</p>

<p>So, does anyone know how to unblock a Youtube channel from your account? In its infinite wisdom, Youtube put the ‘block channel’ button immediately under ‘show transcript’ and didn’t ask for a confirmation so now I’ve blocked Kiara apparently.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks to the three people who replied (/u/DanteKir, /u/JimmyBoombox, and /u/SillyRabbit000); turns out I did a big dumb.

<p>This is heavily questionable. There’s a revisionist school of historians of Central Asia, most prominently Scott C. Levi, who have problematised our notions of the Silk Road, to the point of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jsb5my/whats_the_state_of_scholarship_on_the_silk_road/gbyl2uc/">arguing that it never existed at all</a> in the form popularly imagined. In any event, the apparent secular decline of Central Asia in the 18th century that culminated in the slow collapse of the Bukharan Khanate was followed by the rise of Kokand and Khiva as powers in their own right with considerable regional influence.</p>

<p>Even that would let things slip through the cracks.

<p>—– <strong>1038.1</strong> —–2023-01-09 00:24:26+08:00:</p>

<p>Historically, small ships have always had utility that has made them more viable to field (er, float?) in large numbers than big ones. Take the Imperial Japanese Navy for instance: going off Wikipedia’s numbers, over the course of WW2 it deployed 12 battleships and 13 fleet carriers for 25 total ‘heavy’ capital ships; add in its 7 light carriers, 10 escort carriers and 18 heavy cruisers and that’s 60 capital or capital-adjacent ships. But they also deployed 25 light cruisers, 169 fleet destroyers, 180 destroyer escorts, 21 lighter sea-going vessels, and 195 submarines. In other words, over three times as many submarines as capital(-ish) ships, and nearly <em>six</em> times as many destroyers. And the reason for that is simple: the small ships do tasks that it is impractical to use big ships for.</p>

<p>The core function of capital ships is to be heavy hitters in a decisive engagement: powerful weaponry and high survivability are the order of the day, and it is worth noting that capital ships could also often be pretty fast if they revved their engines up fully. But that doesn’t make them some kind of all-round superweapon. If you need to escort convoys long distances, you want ships that prioritise fuel capacity and efficiency, over weapons and armour if necessary. If you’re trying to attack such convoys, you want ships that have low detectability, high escape ability (whether by speed or stealth), and heavy offensive weaponry. If you need to patrol an area of coastline, six small ships with their own detection systems spread out across a wide area will do you far better than a single heavy ship with just one of those systems.</p>

<p>And smaller vessels can have a significant tactical role: destroyers in particular started out as torpedo boats whose role was to essentially Zerg rush battleships by using agility to avoid hits and sheer numbers to absorb them, then fire torpedoes that would hit the ship under the waterline and knock it out of action. ‘Torpedo boat destroyers’ were then built to counter these, and then over time the two simply merged into a single ship type with greater survivability. And the simple reality is that much as it would be ideal to just throw battleships at the problem, destroyers were purpose-built to destroy unescorted capital ships. You needed to have some kind of parity with your own destroyers to keep the enemy’s at a distance. In short, destroyers beat capital ships, but escorted capital ships beat destroyers, so you needed both in order to be successful.</p>

<p>How does this translate to Star Trek? Firstly, smaller ships are more efficient at carrying out tasks that you just need <em>a</em> ship for, not the <em>best</em> ship for. If you’re transporting some minor dignitary from one planet to another, a ship that only needs 100 crew will do the job just as well as a ship that needs 1000. Secondly, there are operational tasks for which small ships are outright better at doing the job if adjusted for cost. If you’re patrolling an area of space, two ships with souped-up sensors will do the job as well as a big ship with equivalent sensor power. Thirdly, there are situations where a small ship is just <em>better</em>. If you’re performing a stealth mission, a small ship with a small profile will be much more ideal than a big one. Arguably, it is only the tactical role where, because we don’t necessarily have a good sense of how ships scale in Trek, there doesn’t seem to be an obvious reason why larger numbers of smaller ships would be necessarily preferable. Two ships that are 50% the size of a Galaxy-class may well have the same total firepower, survivability, and target profile. <em>But</em>. Given that these ships have more <em>non</em>-tactical utility, that’s why they’re still around.</p>

<p>The thing is, the Federation’s model may not actually be impractical: it probably takes more resources to build a big ship than a small one, and we don’t quite know how the scalability works. The Dominion War necessitated building more ships <em>in general</em>, because the Federation had got away with having a comparatively small fleet <em>overall</em> up to that point.</p>

<p>It’d be tricky as China proper has historically not had a land border with the general South Asia region. While there was significant Chinese contact with Iran-based states, particularly the early Caliphates, this was mediated via Central Asia and a direct result of mutual competing interests in the earlier part of the Tang Empire’s existence, which coincided with a period of relative fragmentation in northern India. The only subsequent contacts into South Asia would therefore have had to involve either competing interest in Central Asia or in Tibet, which is why ultimately the first significant ‘Sino’-‘Indian’ contacts would be under the Qing: the conflicts with Nepal in the 1790s and the Sikh Empire in the 1840s. That’s not to say there was not interest, nor, more importantly, that private individuals did not travel from one to the other, but it is to say that actual diplomacy was pretty limited. The thing to read on this is Matthew Mosca’s <em>From Frontier Policy to Foreign Policy</em>, which discusses Qing impressions of India and relations with Indian states and latterly the East India Company. You may also be interested in <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/saksaha/13401746.0018.002?view=text;rgn=main">this article</a> also by Mosca which discusses early Manchu claims to suzerainty over India.</p>

<p>Huh. I knew that the Japanese side of Multiple AI was reworked into two new VTubers outright but I had no idea the Chinese side was retained. I wrote about Multiple AI <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/th0gow/virtual_youtubers_the_first_years_of_vtubing/">here</a> but as said, no idea the Chinese side had continued.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.5</strong> —–2023-01-09 11:32:55+08:00:</p>

<p>I’m going purely off plot summary and wider context here, but it feels like the story of Wu Zetian is the easiest one to fall into a girlboss trap over. I’m also going to say this: for someone who publicly decries Han chauvinism, choosing to present peoples beyond SciFi!China as literal mythological-alien monster creatures is a <em>choice</em>, even if it is ultimately subverted by revealing the setting is in fact a colonial one, with Space!China as the coloniser. The issue is, even if you do agree that the subversion undercuts the ostensible problem, you then run into a historical issue: for the <em>most</em> part the Tang frontier to the north was not a continually expanding colonial border where Han Chinese had simply transplanted themselves (a la the south): the areas of Han settlement and the nomadic fringe had been broadly defined for a long time (albeit very much blending into each other). So then the analogy becomes confused.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.6</strong> —–2023-01-11 01:55:24+08:00:</p>

<p>Nora Cat, not to be confused with Noraneko. This happened in February 2018, barely 10 months after their original debut and decidedly in the very early years of VTubing – per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/mfzssc/here_are_the_30_oldest_vtubers_in_the_industry/">this post</a> on r/VirtualYoutubers,  Nora Cat was the second VTuber <em>ever</em> if we start counting from Kizuna AI, and my unsubstantiated estimate would have it that fewer than 100 VTubers even existed at the time of the leak, compared to at least 20,000 as of November last year <a href="https://www.userlocal.jp/press/20221129vt/">per data analysis site UserLocal</a>.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.7</strong> —–2023-01-11 09:56:12+08:00:</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://data.nextshark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oyaku-e1517959734945.jpg">the middle image of this screenshot</a> is what the incident looked like. Bear in mind that as noted, Nora Cat was pretty much the second VTuber ever if we go by a Kizuna AI-based definition, and was essentially created from scratch as a solo project. Whatever method they were using seems to have involved the following process, which most Live2D and 3D programs technically use:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The camera records their face directly.</li>
  <li>Facial recognition trickery marks out the position of their facial features to produce a ‘mask’.</li>
  <li>The model is then basically mapped onto the mask.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, they did not have the benefit of commercial programs that just outputted the end product. Instead, all three stages were technically being hosted directly on their stream setup. The raw footage, the mask, and the final model were all layered on top of each other, but the raw footage and the mask were usually transparent. On this occasion, the transparencies seem to have been flipped, thus leading to the incident.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.8</strong> —–2023-01-11 10:22:57+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this was a couple years ago so they were probably using prprlive or facerig</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was February 2018 and they started out in April 2017; as far as I’m aware their setup (with 3D model incidentally) was scratchbuilt or at least highly improvised.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.9</strong> —–2023-01-13 02:38:04+08:00:</p>

<p>So, I legitimately did not know that Bushiroad was behind <em>BanG Dream!</em>, I thought they just did TCGs. Now that I do know, their sponsorship of Hololive’s 3rd major live concert suddenly makes a whole lot more sense.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1040.10</strong> —–2023-01-13 03:02:29+08:00:</p>

<p>Ah, which also gives context to Great-O-Khan, of Bushiroad-owned New Japan Pro Wrestling, being a fan of Hololive member Oozora Subaru to the point of having a move specifically based on a lock she performs in an animated episode.</p>

<p>不是，英政府实际对卖地和储备地是相对保守的，虽然也预期大规模开发，但是因为基本盘不同，可实行性也不一样。</p>

<p>主要问题来自于香港客观土地的确太少了，而且密集集中在少数地区。</p>

<p>香港现在楼价极高，除了客观原因，还有人祸，其中一个核心因素是董建华执政时期，他们有一个八万五计划，这个很多人应该是知道的。</p>

<p>但是八万五没有预先做充足调研和舆论铺垫，突然拿出来，直接导致楼价暴跌，外加经济本身就有过热的风险。</p>

<p>楼价下跌的最终影响是政府土地收入大幅度下滑，大量银行坏账，全社会通缩与问责，然后董建华的幕僚班底给出的方案是停止出地和公屋居屋建设。</p>

<p>也就是说，他们制造了价格下跌，让中产和购房者负资产后，又强行制造市场短缺来推高楼价。</p>

<p>而香港人口是不断增长，房屋需求不断增加，但是能给基层的公屋，给经济较好基层的居屋，以及商品性质的私人房屋都长期开发停滞，市场在这期间是求大于供，本身就是刚需，需求囤积十几年，到梁振英政府才开始重新全面转向。</p>

<p>许多新界土地，又被掌握在支持董建华上台的乡绅和建制派利益集团手里，这些地到林郑月娥时期也根本拿不回来，这群人是他们的基本盘，不敢也没能力得罪。</p>

<p>转而被迫用更高成本和更久时间去开发山地、填海和郊野公园。</p>

<p>八万五本身的拿不到那么多地，无法执行的一个幌子，这种幌子却对市场有极大冲击。</p>

<p>如果说能兑现，最后稳定市场价格，哪怕楼价下跌，但大部分人的住房需求被满足，那么政府起码还有能力抽手去给银行坏账和受影响的人补贴。</p>

<p>然而八万五既做不到足够多的土地去执行计划，还把可能的雷全踩了一遍，最后用最蠢的做法，强行停滞市场供应来给他们自己擦屁股，最后香港一地鸡毛。</p>

<p>所以说董建华政府是24K傻逼，整个幕僚团队凑不出一个脑子。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1953.1</strong> —–2023-01-07 21:07:48+08:00:</p>

<p>目前中央的策略主线有两条</p>

<p>1.进行税务改革，直接税逐步进入财政覆盖范畴，从而提高财政收入与中央财政安全，打的名义是向发达国家看齐，税务体制现代化。</p>

<p>2.默许地方对农村宅基地动手脚，进一步赶农民入城，不留后路，制造土地和公共服务的稀缺性。</p>

<p>除此之外的软方案，就是限制地方债的额度，各种重组来转嫁、拖延风险。</p>

<p>中国能收直接税的群体有限，给财政增长跑赢利息与开销增速的时间不会太多，可能也就不到十年，不过具体要看未来两年地方财政的恶化程度，如果年年都跟2022年一样甚至更糟，那么直接税续命的目的反而可能刺激问题恶化。</p>

<p>疫情开放问题上，地方先后程度和执行力度不一致，可以判断中共的草台班子大概率是没有外界认为那么严谨的统一调度的，尤其是在一些重大问题上，中央甚至可能碍于政治因素不便于表态，不会给出非常直接明确的命令，进而留给地方自行揣摩。</p>

<p>之后几年一个是看经济细节而非整体，另一个是看地方政府有多少进入非名义破产（实质性破产，但政府不叫破产的客观事件）</p>

<p>—– <strong>1953.2</strong> —–2023-01-14 13:34:32+08:00:</p>

<p>政府找人接盘还是政府的土地财政税收，核心逻辑始终是从社会获取财富来解决问题，但伴随通胀和经济增长，开发成本与接盘成本也越来越高，而分配不公让社会上对这些债务、商品的承受能力、购买能力都逐渐触及上限。</p>

<p>这也导致政府各种工具解决问题的效率越来越低，尤其是财政工具。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1953.3</strong> —–2023-01-14 13:37:20+08:00:</p>

<p>房产税有局部实行，不太乐观，但未来可能会大规模实行，这可能是第三次分配里追求共同富裕的一个目标。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1953.4</strong> —–2023-01-14 22:05:31+08:00:</p>

<p>就算没这些政治因素，单纯考虑客观经济规律也拼不起来。</p>

<p>任何国家发展到一定程度，都会转型成内需经济，中国目前情况是社会制度不转型，政府坚持走容易控制的廉价劳动力，也不愿意给创新的文化、科技企业提供更多的自由度，更不愿意开放和建立一个健全的金融市场机制提供合理的融资渠道。</p>

<p>对中小企不但不扶持，甚至采取打压，推动大企业进行垄断方便控制社会资源。</p>

<p>哪怕现在把这些都松两三分力，说我们要搞经济，内需社会也无法转型，而经济增速其中一个重要指标，国内的投资严重依赖债务和土地财政的配合。</p>

<p>民众买房是真买不起，差不多到极限了，毕竟企业发展是可以看到增速上限，意味着能提供中高收入就业的岗位数量也有限，大部分人结婚才买房，就业岗位随时可以除以二来一个家庭计算一套房。</p>

<p>到时候新楼盘很快就会缺乏初次购买的家庭接盘，反而是更多有能力多买的人会购入，营造一种房子好像还卖的很好，实际看租房市场大概率明面增长然后阴跌，尤其是外地务工人员跟本地试图买房买不起需要租房的新夫妻竞争，外地务工人员随着城市扩张与租金成本提高被迫离开，带来阴跌，而家庭无法购房的租房比例提高，给市场带来明面上的增长。</p>

<p>如果房子真那么好卖，恒大在内的许多房企不会有财政问题，说白了最小购房单位大体上是家庭，大多数人不结婚，或者结婚就压根买不起房子。</p>

<p>粗略做个计算就知道，90后人口大概1.8亿浮动，如果不考虑死亡、单身等乱七八糟元素，暴力计算字面可得9000万个家庭，与同等数量的住房需求，这里也不考虑家里本来有空房的，大部分人还是需要新房。</p>

<p>我随手了一个数据，指每年商品房建成750万套，还有的数据说空置房可能在9000万套，但是已知的新生儿出生数量才一千多万，不考虑二胎问题，都算家庭头胎需要买房，这个需求数量跟建成数量落差已经很小了。</p>

<p>哪怕不考虑经济问题，只考虑行政问题，去年末光速开放，但各地执行却严重不统一，但又百分之八百是来自中央的要求。</p>

<p>那么可以得出结论，中央即便给命令了，各地执行落差也非常大，不做不错的现象很明显，所以才有某些地方开放很快，某些地方反复横跳。</p>

<p>基本上中共已经给人一种朝气全无的草台班子的感觉，庞大、低效、见一步走一步，可用社会与财政工具越来越少，能用的工具效率也越来越弱。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ForeignAffairsMag在2023-01-02~2023-01-08的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-04/ForeignAffairsMag/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ForeignAffairsMag在2023-01-02~2023-01-08的言论" /><published>2023-01-04T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-04/ForeignAffairsMag</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-04/ForeignAffairsMag/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>332.1</strong> —–2023-01-04 04:36:30+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Aluf Benn, editor-in-chief of</strong> <strong><em>Haaretz</em></strong>: “Benjamin Netanyahu has returned to power with a mission: making Israel into an openly racist authoritarian state, one that puts Orthodox Judaism ahead of human rights, treats its Arab citizens as an enemy, and demolishes the checks and balances imposed by a strong, independent judiciary. The prime minister has secured power by cobbling together a parliamentary coalition that views democratic and liberal ideas as foreign implants aimed at undermining the Jewish identity of the state. The agreements that bind the coalition’s member parties are a blueprint of revolution. The members have pledged to allow discrimination against women, non-Jews, and LGBTQ people “for reasons of religious belief.” They have called the large Arab population in Israel’s northern and southern districts a “demographic challenge.” Israeli political agreements are rarely implemented to the letter, but they serve as statements of intent and signal the direction in which policymakers will go. The current set of agreements have made it clear that the country’s new governing coalition will be the most right-wing in Israeli history. . . . With diminishing domestic checks on Netanyahu’s power, outside states will play a critical role in determining just how many authoritarian and racist policies he can put into effect.”</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-12-26~2023-01-01的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-01/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-12-26~2023-01-01的言论" /><published>2023-01-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-01/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2023-01-01/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1011.1</strong> —–2022-12-28 17:39:19+08:00:</p>

<p>While the production of opium in India was controlled through an East India Company monopoly, once a chest of opium reached the auction houses at Calcutta it was, for all intents and purposes, on the open market. The opium trade between the British Empire and the Qing is thus best seen not as an exchange between two actors but rather a much more multilateral affair, in which opium was produced in British India and found its end users in various places in China, but where its journey could involve a variety of interests both within and without those two empires. Granted, the ‘country trade’ that linked Calcutta and Canton was largely dominated by British subjects, but this was not solely restricted to white British merchants: Zoroastrian Parsis worked both as partners of British firms and in pursuit of their own interests, with magnates such as Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy and Rustomjee Cowasjee running their own opium smuggling businesses. And there were some Americans who were able to operate ‘country’ ships – for instance, the US Consul in China, Benjamin Wilcocks, co-owned at least one opium clipper with his brother, which was used to ship opium to China under British flag during the War of 1812. By the 1830s, the American firm Russell &amp; Co., which bought up its predecessor, Perkins &amp; Co., would account for roughly one fifth of Indian opium exports to China, 
buying opium at auction in Calcutta and smuggling it up the Pearl River Delta.</p>

<p>But we ought to expand our view a little further, because while the EIC held a monopoly on opium production <em>within its directly-administered territory</em>, it did <em>not</em> have a monopoly on opium on the global market. The princely states of Malwa produced their own opium without Company oversight and exported it via Portuguese Goa, leading to a period of price competition after about 1818, during which the EIC did essentially lose its ability to exert unilateral control over opium prices. The independent state of Sindh produced its own opium as well, which directly contributed to its conquest by the EIC in 1843. Central Asian states like Kokand and Afghanistan had domestic opium industries – indeed, Kokandi opium smuggling in Xinjiang led to the Qing signing a commercial treaty with Kokand in 1835 that was <em>remarkably</em> similar to the terms of the later Treaty of Nanjing and Treaty of the Bogue that would be signed with Britain later. And finally, there was the Ottoman Empire, which produced a modest though not insignificant quantity of opium of its own, ranging from around 2500-3000 chests a year, for sale at Smyrna (now İzmir).</p>

<p>While the quantity of Indian opium exported to China far exceeded Turkish supplies, Smyrna nevertheless provided an opium source for businessmen outside the British empire, even before the annexation of Sindh cut off most of the independent supply to Goa, with the harvest season providing opium from late July/early August to spring early the next year. American merchants originally worked with the British Levant Company, but increasingly operated independently after 1800, becoming the chief supplier of Turkish opium to China. Figures from 1829 show that of 2700 chests of opium sold in Smyrna, 1300 were purchased by American merchants for shipment to China (1100 by the consortium of Perkins &amp; Co., J. &amp; T.H. Perkins, and Bryant &amp; Sturgis; the remainder by Joseph Peabody), 5-600 by Dutch merchants for shipment to Batavia (now Jakarta), and the remainder went to the European market.</p>

<p>It’s worth briefly discussing the Perkins-Bryant-Sturgis consortium because this does directly bear on part of your question. In effect, this consortium, dominated by the Perkins family, was one that stretched across multiple cities. While J. &amp; T.H. Perkins and Bryand &amp; Sturgis were headquartered in Boston, Perkins &amp; Co. was a branch of the Perkins company based out of Canton; moreover, some members of the Perkins family had settled in Smyrna, creating personal ties to the city. Perkins ships thus linked three nodes not just of the Perkins’ business network, but indeed of the family itself. Indeed, the Smyrna connection was been vital to the Perkins family’s involvement in Turkish opium: it was thanks to having a branch of the company in Canton reporting on a growing import market, while a branch of the family in Smyrna reported on a growing export market, that the company experimented with shipping opium in the first place. But there was a complication created by the circumstances of Smyrna itself, which was often visited by infectious disease. While Perkins ships did sometimes buy opium directly from Smyrna, it was often the case that they would pick up Turkish opium further west, commissioning other merchants to move shipments to safer middleman ports such in the Western Mediterranean or even as far afield as London, offloading the risk onto their own set of middlemen.</p>

<p>The US role in opium smuggling in China is often badly understated, but its impact was arguably pretty considerable: until about 1800, the East India Company had been able to keep opium prices artificially high through being essentially the only supplier of opium to China outside of small-scale smuggling from Central Asia (and even then it is unclear how far that smuggled opium spread outside of Xinjiang). But the growth of Malwa and Turkish opium destroyed this EIC monopoly, and forced a change of strategy, as the Company, heavily reliant on revenues generated by duties on its opium exports, found that it was being outcompeted on price and so would have to instead compete on quantity. Arguably, it was the rise of the American trade in Turkish opium that led to the EIC changing tack from producing limited quantities of heavily marked-up product to simply flooding the Chinese market instead, with all the ails that followed. In turn, American firms drove competition in the ‘country trade’ selling Indian opium, securing a significant stake in all areas of the opium commerce.</p>

<p>I generally like the combat system in Craig Woodfield’s <em>Ronin</em> and <em>En Garde</em> – models have a combat pool, and at the start of each round of combat they split this pool between Attack and Defence tokens. You then roll for initiative, with each player rolling 1D6; an Attack token can be used to enhance the initiative roll, with the enhancing player rolling 2D6 and discarding the lower. The player with initiative can then make one attack by expending an Attack token, rolling 2D6 and adding any modifiers; the defender rolls 1D6 and adds theirs. If the attack score exceeds the defence, the defending figure takes a wound, whose severity depends on how much the difference is. An additional Attack token can be used to enhance an attack, allowing the attacker to roll 3D6 and discard the lowest, while a Defence token can be used to enhance defence, allowing the defender to roll 2D6 and keep both. Basically, Defence tokens are how you will realistically survive attacks, so it creates an interesting quandary over how many attacks to take and how many defences.</p>

<p>I’m sure others can chime in with other perspectives, but to bring up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k3069r/was_the_great_wall_of_china_effective_we_all_know/gdyv0c7/">one of my old posts</a>, the answer would seem to be yes. The ‘Great Wall’, insofar as we can speak of one, was built by the Ming to deter steppe raiders and to avert a steppe conquest, and in that regard it was mostly successful. While the Ming did start seeing Manchu raids after the 1620s, the logistical difficulties of sustaining forces south of the wall meant the Manchus couldn’t actually hold any territory. Ultimately, the Ming fell to domestic, not external causes; the Manchus crossed the wall <em>after</em> the Ming collapse.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1014.2</strong> —–2022-12-31 00:12:09+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s also outright wrong. While several Chinese states engaged in wall-building, there was no chronologically and territorially continuous structure across northern China until the Ming (although the intellectual notion of a northern frontier persisted even in periods where no functional wall existed). There is no hard evidence suggesting the death count of wall-building labourers outside of perhaps the period after the collapse of the Jin state in the early 300s, and this was associated with all kinds of fortification works by competing states within China, rather than frontier walls across the north. And then we have to note that the Mongols entered China at a time when it <em>did not have a frontier wall</em>; the Manchus conquered China <em>after its previous government collapsed</em>. You’ve hit the nail on the head here with regards to the lazy reuse of oriental stereotyping.</p>

<p>I hope they will; I don’t know if they will. There’s historically been a lot of mixed messaging from the talents (at least in EN) on whether the non-JP branches are idol things (Kiara’s generally suggested no, Calli’s generally suggested yes), and I would imagine that they’d have a clearer line if it was an official position. That said, the idol stuff was basically sprung on Gens 1-3 shortly before 1st Fes and only became formally ingrained subsequently, so there’s no reason that we couldn’t end up with idol outfits of some kind, if not for 4th Fes then some time later on. Potentially it may end up just being opt-in, especially for those who can or will do a lot of 3d collab concert activities. But as said, we don’t know what goes on behind the scenes.

<p>/u/0neDividedbyZer0 has written a pretty good answer covering some aspects of the question, but there are a couple of pieces of the puzzle that I think ought to be added.</p>

<p>The main one is that pastoral nomadic societies are <em>extremely</em> optimised for military mobilisation, as an extension of the way nomadic lifestyles are sustained. Firstly, just about every member of a nomadic society – women as well as men, mind you – learned to ride as a natural consequence of these societies’ mobility. Men especially, but often women too, would learn archery for hunting. In other words, just about everyone in a pastoral nomadic society didn’t just know how to ride and shoot, they rode and shot <em>constantly</em> out of necessity. The skills necessary to survive on the steppe were the vital skills of premodern combat, more or less by sheer coincidence. Secondly, the amount of labour input required in pastoral nomadic food production was not particularly high nor particularly intensive, which meant that compared to a sedentary polity, a nomadic society could afford to devote a lot more people to fighting relative to food production. Thirdly, as long as you were militarily successful, warfare <em>was</em> a form of food production, in that a highly mobile army ranging across a wide area could steal a <em>lot</em> of food as booty, so that you didn’t need as much livestock in your home herds to feed them anyway. Because of this, a comparatively huge proportion of a nomadic society’s population could be sent to fight: Nikolai Kradin estimates that they could mobilise up to 75% of their adult male population, which depending on how you assess dependency ratios translates to just under 20% of the population at large. This theoretical upper limit substantially exceeds most sedentary polities’ capacities before the 20th century: for a point of comparison, Metropolitan France mobilised 8 million men out of around 40 million people in WWI, and even then, not all of them were fighting troops, and not all were mobilised simultaneously, <em>and</em> this mobilisation placed an extraordinary strain on France as a country, whereas large-scale mobilisations of steppe nomadic warriors were a matter of course.</p>

<p>Another, though, is that vulnerability to nomads was not a uniquely Chinese problem – European, Middle Eastern and South Asian polities similarly struggled. For a bit more detail you may want to have a look at some of my other past answers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AFAIK Nijisanji is still bigger in Japan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it gets Complexicated depending on what metrics you use and how deep you delve. Here I’m going off sub counts:</p>

<p>Last I checked Niji claims around 60m total subscribers across its roughly 170 YT channels; Holo claims around 69 million across 71. Holo’s international branches account for a little over 23 million as of current count, so more or less exactly a third. NijiEN accounts for about 14.5 million, or just under a quarter. So in that sense, Nijisanji’s Japanese branch draws a bigger proportion of Nijisanji viewership compared to Hololive’s Japanese branches for Hololive. However, the overall sizes of their Japanese branches, going by pure subscriber numbers, are more or less exactly the same at around 46 million. (Indeed, Niji might be very slightly smaller.)</p>

<p>What then complicates this further is that Nijisanji’s Japanese branch is much bigger in terms of total membership (141) compared to Hololive’s (35 Hololive and 13 Holostars for 48 total). The big open question when it comes to viewership practices is how many people subscribe to how many channels. A so-called ‘DD’ (<em>daredemo daisuki</em>, ‘loves anyone’) may well subscribe to everyone as a sign of support, but a DD for Nijisanji will add 141 subscribers to the total count while one for Hololive will add 48. So I think it’s likely, but not certain, that the subscriber overlap inflates Nijisanji’s total viewership figures to a greater extent than Hololive’s, <em>especially</em> if we account for the trend of existing agency fans mass-subbing to a new talent pre-debut rather than new debutants starting from scratch. All of Nijisanji EN’s most recent group of 6 debutants, XSoleil, hit 100k subscribers from pre-debut hype, but those 600k total subscrip<em>tions</em> came from 100k subscri<em>bers</em>, if that makes sense. The same, of course, is true of HoloEN Council getting at least 200k each pre-debut.</p>

<p>But then the elephant in the room is overseas viewership of Japanese talents and Japanese viewership of non-overseas talents, and in that situation we can’t really extrapolate from individual members’ occasional statements too much. Stream donation currency breakdowns might be the only viable route, but I’ve only ever seen it done by Hololive stats nerds and not for Niji. It’s probably reasonable to say that overseas viewership accounts for more of HoloJP’s audience than it does for NijiJP, but how far is unclear. Presumably that counteracts the statistical effect of subscriber overlaps a bit if we’re trying to ascertain audience sizes within Japan, but in the end, there’s a lot of variables to control for, not all of which are possible to mine the stats for directly.</p>

<p>I’ll add also that there are sites like VStats that have <a href="https://www.vstats.jp/leaderboard/today">daily top 50 leaderboards for maximum and average stream viewership</a>, and a quick scroll suggests that Hololive usually dominates the top 25, except on major event days. For instance the free part of Day 1 of Nijisanji’s end-of-year event on <a href="https://www.vstats.jp/leaderboard/2022-12-29">29 December</a> got a whopping 242k maximum concurrent viewers, while Hololive’s <a href="https://www.vstats.jp/leaderboard/2022-12-31">end-of-year event on 31 December</a> got 197k. So Niji can definitely get a lot of viewers together for agency-wide events, but the maximum viewership of any individual talent tends to be lower than their Hololive equivalents.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.3</strong> —–2023-01-03 01:07:27+08:00:</p>

<p>It’ll depend obviously, but at the same time, Salome didn’t hit the VTuber record for fastest to 1m subs based purely off organic success. Niji hardly lacks brand identity, and especially when we look at more recent talent waves, which have been concentrated in the EN branch, there’s a lot of existing audience recycling at work. And I don’t want to say this as some kind of bad thing; rather, I raise it as something that complicates the superficial numbers considerably.</p>

<p>EDIT: Your point about people generally watching one Liver is noted, though, but I think this highlights another way that sub numbers obfuscate things – a lot of people might be hardcore viewers of a particular talent <em>but</em> still have subscriptions to several. Some madlad over a year ago went and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/qalzhg/hololive_data_science_how_much_overlap_is_there/">compared unique commenters on VODs for all five members of HoloMyth to work out the overlap between them</a>, and while frustratingly the raw numbers aren’t there and there’s no number for people who <em>exclusively</em> commented on one member’s VODs, for each given combination the overlap was always smaller than either member individually. In other words, to lift one example, more people commented on Ina VODs but not Ame VODs, or on Ame VODs but not Ina VODs, than commented on both. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/qke1pa/hololive_data_science_part_2_i_collected_almost/">sequel to that looked at chatters</a>, but that showed much higher levels of overlap – more people chatted on both Ame and Ina’s streams than just chatted on Ina’s, though more people still only chatted on Ame’s streams than on both.</p>

<p>But I think there’s an explanation for why these stats differ, and it’s that chatting and commenting are distinctly different forms of engagement. Chatting means you’re watching the stream live, which means you’ve got a narrower range of choices because it’s entirely dependent on who is streaming at a given moment. Let’s imagine someone who mainly watches Mumei, and is online when she’s not streaming. If they decide they want to watch a stream live, they’ll go with whoever is streaming at that moment even if it’s not Mumei, and are likely to engage in chat as well; in order to be able to do so, they will likely be subscribed to a wider set of talents. If they decide to watch a VOD, though, they’ll probably watch a Mumei VOD specifically, and may comment on that. So that would go some way to explaining how both of our points can be true at once: people can <em>mainly</em> be viewers of a particular talent, but still contribute to some of the metrics of other talents by virtue of spreading themselves out to catch more streams.</p>

<p>So yes, people can be into a particular Niji talent rather than the Niji brand as a whole. But it’s more than likely they’re subbed to more Niji members than just their oshi, just to increase the chances that <em>someone</em> that they know they enjoy watching will be streaming at a convenient time. On the flip side, a similar dynamic can exist with Hololive too: there are some people who pretty much primarily watch one specific talent or a group of them, but still have subscriptions across the agency to cover more ground.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be fair, doctors do find that to have a healthy set of bowel movements (basically you’re not constipated) is to have at least 3 bowel movements in a day, or like every other day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume, then, it should have been ‘at least three bowel movements in a week’?</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.6</strong> —–2023-01-05 17:41:02+08:00:</p>

<p>There are identical flavours of funky that have existed before, but not in this combination nor as strongly. <em>Most</em> of HoloJP’s generations have debuted within a week, but there are a few exceptions, usually easily explained:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gen 0 consists of solo debutants within HoloPro (Sora, Roboco, Miko, AZKi, Suisei) and was defined retrospectively.</li>
  <li>Gen 1 <em>technically</em> was spread out: Mel debuted on Youtube on 13 May 2018, while the others (Aki, Matsuri, Fubuki, Haato, and Chris) debuted over the course of 1-3 June. However, Mel was not originally part of Gen 1; it was Chris’ termination a week or so later led to her being retconned into Gen 1 despite originally being a standalone. The ‘official’ Gen 1 was always supposed to have been the five who debuted between 1 and 3 June.</li>
  <li>Gen 2 had quite a spread out run of debuts: Aqua on 8 August, Shion on 17/08, Ayame on 03/09, Choco on 05/09 and Subaru on 16/09. But this wasn’t really a separation into different batches.</li>
  <li>Gamers is weird by virtue of being a spinoff branch: Mio debuted on 7 December 2018, while Okayu and Korone debuted a week apart on 6 and 13 April, respectively. This makes it a very close precedent for Tempus given the 5-month gap, but there is a noticeable difference in Tempus being ‘core’ generations/units within Holostars English and having two sets of four members, whereas Gamers was always a HoloJP spinoff with three members total; in essence it was originally an extra solo member with Mio (plus existing member Fubuki), with an extra pair added later.</li>
  <li>Gen 3 <em>did</em> split between two batches: Pekora and Rushia on 17 and 18 July 2019, and Flare, Noel, and Marine on 8, 9, and 11 August. This is the next closest Tempus precedent, but the gap was a lot closer.</li>
  <li>Gen 4 all debuted between 27 December 2019 (Kanata) and 4 January 2020 (Luna).</li>
  <li>Gen 5 debuted on consecutive days from 12 August 2020 (Lamy) to 16 August (Polka).</li>
  <li>Gen 6 debuted on consecutive days from 26 November 2021 (La+) to 30 November (Iroha).</li>
</ul>

<p>So while yes, <em>technically</em> five of eight generations didn’t follow an ‘everyone debuts in a week’ format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gen 0 was an after-the-fact thing;</li>
  <li>Gen 1 <em>would</em> have were it not for the stuff around Hitomi Chris;</li>
  <li>Gen 2 still had a spread debut rather than two batches like Tempus;</li>
  <li>Gamers did have two batches like Tempus, but with far fewer people total;</li>
  <li>Gen 3 did two batches, but less than a month apart.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we consider Gen 0 and Gamers as complete outliers structurally, then Gen 3 is the <em>only</em> conventional HoloJP generation to have intentionally debuted in two distinct batches. So Tempus being a full gen split into two batches 5 months apart is a half-and-half between what happened with Gamers and what happened with Gen 3. Individual elements are precedented, but the combination isn’t.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.7</strong> —–2023-01-05 20:56:25+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s similar and it also isn’t in that Niji presumably has its roster of however many talents picked out, and then debuts them with a couple months’ delay. Whereas what seems to have happened with Tempus is that they must have felt 6 was too many to start off with but they still wanted those 6, and so further emphasised <em>more</em> auditions to add in an extra 2.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.8</strong> —–2023-01-05 21:36:35+08:00:</p>

<p>Holostars is about as neatly organised as a bowl of spaghetti being jostled by a jackhammer.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.9</strong> —–2023-01-06 11:15:59+08:00:</p>

<p>So there’s three ways to talk about ‘Sub Rosa’.</p>

<p>The first is to genuinely say yes, it was considered one of the worst episodes of the show, certainly of that season. IMDB has it as the second-worst TNG episode at a whopping 4.8/10, which, to its slight credit, is a significant stretch ahead of the dead-last episode, the Season 2 clip-show episode ‘Shades of Grey’, which sits at a 3.3. But there are other good candidates for worst episode: the horrendously racist ‘Code of Honour’ in Season 1, or the… not necessarily <em>racist</em> but certainly stereotype-laden ‘Up the Long Ladder’ in Season 2.</p>

<p>The second is to approach it as a ‘so bad it’s good’. The stilted dialogue, the absurd worldbuilding, the <em>terrible</em> false accent on the ‘Scottish’ groundskeeper, and, best of all, the <em>entire</em> scene with Crusher’s reanimating grandmother. It’s definitely not The Animated Series or ‘Spock’s Brain’ levels of ‘so bad it’s good’, but it can certainly be approached in an ironic fashion.</p>

<p>The third is to really contextualise it within the seventh season of TNG as a piece of media. Firstly, let’s look at production. For seasons 6 and 7 there were now two ongoing Trek series (DS9 started midway through TNG S6), and that meant that writers were spread thinner, with double the episodes to fill out. On top of that, by Season 7 quite a few of the key production staff were looking ahead to Voyager and to the TNG films, which again meant a little less focus on the core show. Now, that doesn’t explain <em>all</em> of it: officially, the story was done by Jeri Taylor, who wrote ‘Unification’ and ‘The Drumhead’, so that should be good, right? Except Taylor was inspired by a submission from Jeanna Gallo, a fanzine contributor, and so the story isn’t wholly Taylor’s idea – it’s essentially a staff writer trying to adapt a fanfic. Then we have to consider that the story was adapted to teleplay format by Brannon Braga, who actually wrote some very good mind-bendy scripts (‘Phantasms’ is his, and so is ‘Cause and Effect’), but is otherwise pretty infamous as Rick Berman’s right-hand yes-man as far as creative decisions went. As a writer he seems to have been pretty good, but as an adapter he seems to have been behind a lot of mid-tier to poor episodes. To take S5, although he wrote ‘Cause and Effect’ which is fantastic, of his three adapted scripts – ‘The Game’, ‘Power Play’, and ‘Imaginary Friend’ – two of those are generally regarded as sub-par.</p>

<p>But we can also look at Season 7 more thematically, and in that regard, Sub Rosa is uniquely poor in execution, but in concept it is largely in line with much of the rest of the season. Season 7’s big underlying theme is tying up loose ends. TNG’s primary draw, even through its very uneven first two seasons, had been a well-defined cast of characters, that had maintained that definition despite the revolving door of staff and guest writers behind the show’s 178 episodes. Part of that was that backstory details would be drip-fed as required by a given episode, which meant you didn’t have to follow a very strict character backstory for anyone for the most part, nor did you even have to reference such details in a later story. Probably the only characters who had received relatively fleshed-out backstories over the first six seasons were Data (but his backstory is pretty short) and Worf (because his is relatively convoluted). But with the show now approaching a definite conclusion, the writers suddenly felt like adding in a load of backstory now that a) it was their last chance and b) it wouldn’t mess up any future scripts as they wouldn’t exist. This manifests in two ways: first is a general focus on people’s backstories; the second is a motif revolving around family, and especially of letting go of them. Some episodes may not deal with character backstories, but they fit into a pattern in which some episodes – especially in the first half or so – emphasise the main cast’s parents and grandparents, while those in the latter half focus more on their children.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1: ‘Descent Part II’ – Data defeats Lore for good.</li>
  <li>3: ‘Interface’ – Geordi tries to rescue his mother, and ultimately has to accept her death.</li>
  <li>7: ‘Dark Page’ – Troi uncovers her mother’s repressed memories about her first daughter, who died as a child.</li>

  <li>14: ‘Sub Rosa’ – Crusher’s grandmother, only ever mentioned off-screen, also dies off screen; she is briefly resurrected; Crusher also has sex with her grandmother’s sex ghost boyfriend.</li>
  <li>18: ‘Eye of the Beholder’ – A murder mystery involving the construction of the Enterprise-D itself.</li>
  <li>20: ‘Journey’s End’ – Wesley leaves Starfleet to join the Traveller.</li>
  <li>21: ‘Firstborn’ – Worf works on his relationship with Alexander, and confronts a future Alexander who believes he was raised poorly.</li>
  <li>22: ‘Bloodlines’ – Picard finds out about an illegitimate son – it turns out that he’s not.</li>
  <li>23: ‘Emergence’ – The Enterprise has holo-babies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above is just the most obvious and superficial cases, but 9 of 26 episodes of S7 focus specifically on throwing in new character backstories, 7 of which specifically involve family; then there are at least three further episodes that specifically revolve around characters’ children (if we count the Enterprise itself as a character). So in that sense, Sub Rosa is merely the worst-executed of a set of thematically very similar episodes about dealing with the loss of a family member, often where that family member has only just been introduced for the first time. ‘You’re not Nana! Nana’s dead!’ is an extremely weird line with an equally stilted delivery by Gates McFadden in the take that made it to air, but we can also read it as part of those wider Season 7 motifs of letting go of family members.</p>

<p>That doesn’t make Sub Rosa a <em>good</em> episode, but it is to say (in reiteration) that what’s unique is its execution and not its concept.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.10</strong> —–2023-01-06 11:28:08+08:00:</p>

<p>The episode revolves around Beverley Crusher, the ship’s doctor on TNG except during Season 2. Like most TNG characters her family backstory was generally left obscure until it was needed for an episode, and then written in specifically for it. This is one of those cases: her grandmother (frequently mentioned but never seen on-screen before) has recently died, and we also discover that the women of Crusher’s family had made it a point to keep and pass on their maiden name of Howard, except Crusher herself. This latter point is not at all plot-relevant but a lot of the characters harp on it for some reason.</p>

<p>The Enterprise-D stops by the planet of Caldos IV, where Crusher’s grandmother lived, which is a Federation colony planet terraformed specifically to resemble the Scottish highlands, and where everyone dresses like it’s the 1880s, even the aliens. Yes, just roll with it. The Enterprise is there to perform repairs on the planet’s climate control systems, but it just so happens to coincide with the grandmother’s funeral. As Crusher is sorting through her grandmother’s belongings, she is told by the groundskeeper not to stay in the house, which is haunted, and also to never light her grandmother’s candle. She does not heed the warning, and lights it anyway, summoning a creature taking the form of a man named Ronin. Ronin reveals that he’s boinked every woman in the Howard line since the first one to obtain his candle. Then Ronin has, er, ghost sex with her? This ultimately leads to her being so head-over-heels for him that she decides to retire from spacefaring to live on Caldos IV. Picard is not best pleased and beams down intending to meet Ronin; Ronin attacks him but Crusher comes to Picard’s defence.</p>

<p>The B-plot involves a couple of the ship crew working on the weather system problem, and discovering that there is an abnormal energy source coming from within Crusher’s grandmother’s grave that is causing issues. Turns out, Nana’s alive! Sort of – she’s kind of possessed by Ronin, who’s a sort of energy-vampire, I guess? Crusher convinces Ronin to stop possessing her grandmother, and then shoots and destroys the candle that serves as his vessel, killing him. Somehow she is torn over this, remarking, in relation to her grandmother’s journals, that ‘whatever else he might have done, he made her very happy.’</p>

  <p>where the episode is actually very good but it’s in some way a gross violation of what Star Trek’s supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree vehemently with this assessment: <em>Sisko</em> is violating what Star<em>fleet</em> is supposed to be. But Star <em>Trek</em> isn’t about unironically parroting a frequently-shifting notion of Starfleet’s ethos: it is ultimately a series about moral quandaries in a science-fiction setting, in which Starfleet symbolises a particular ideal. But ideals and realities can clash, and ‘In the Pale Moonlight’ is a frank treatment of how that can play out. A moral quandary stuck between ideals and realities is <em>quintessential</em> Star Trek.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/100kt5g/hobby_scuffles_week_of_january_2_2023/j35appx/">a longer comment</a> about this, but to summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The episode’s essential concept (revisiting or straight up creating a character’s family-related backstory) is a common motif in S7, so in that regard the episode’s not unique.</li>
  <li>Because there was now a spinoff show, the writers were spread thinner than in previous seasons.</li>
  <li>The basics of the story seem to have been based on a submission by a fanfic author, which was then reworked into a more developed story by an experienced staff writer, but it’s not clear how far that fixed it.</li>
  <li>The adaptation from story to screenplay was by someone with a mixed track record on that front.</li>
</ul>

<p>—– <strong>1019.13</strong> —–2023-01-06 20:16:10+08:00:</p>

<p>The story idea came from a fanfic author.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.14</strong> —–2023-01-06 21:15:58+08:00:</p>

<p>One of the things that all three Trek animated series so far – TAS, Lower Decks, and Prodigy – have in common is a real sense of the aesthetic freedom offered by animation as a medium compared to live action. Despite the immensely low budget of TAS, the deliberate inclusion of very distinctively alien characters (including as bridge crew no less), and the really wacky spaceship designs, speak to the ambition of the creators to really make stuff that would never be achievable with practical effects of the time. Lower Decks similarly exploits that with Dr Migleemo and Dr T’ana; Prodigy’s entire core cast is specifically made to be animated.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.15</strong> —–2023-01-06 23:03:07+08:00:</p>

<p>Ronin is a being that can assume the <em>appearance</em> of an adult human man, but the ‘intercourse’ consists of his dissolving into a luminous green vapour and temporarily attaching himself to his corporeal consort and bringing them to a, shall we say, euphoric state in the process. It is stated that although at a basic level, Ronin is tethered to the candle, he also needs to partly tether himself to a human host to sustain the appearance of human form. Thus, Ronin is in the candle, in the grandmother, <em>and</em> outside them interacting with Crusher, all at the same time.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1019.16</strong> —–2023-01-06 23:41:07+08:00:</p>

<p>I disagree, on two grounds. The first is that the concept ultimately still revolves around a newly-introduced set of revelations around Crusher’s family history, which, again, is a very common S7 motif. The second is also that I can imagine the concept actually working: at its core, it’s Star Trek Does Gothic Horror, with a plot involving a ghost that has been manipulating the women of the Crusher family for generations. The one-sentence pitch is not unreasonable. The problem is the execution: the weird attempts to show sex without sex and constantly talking about eroticism that the show, by virtue of rating standards, cannot actually display; the ghost using the grandmother’s body as a conduit to mess with the planet’s weather; the possessed grandmother <em>coming back to life and using Palpatine lightning on people</em>… just… <em>aaaaaaa</em></p>

<p>But this was not how the pitch <em>had</em> to go: had Ronin been creepy rather than charming; had the clear exploitativeness of the relationship been foregrounded rather than ending on the note that the grandmother was happy because of Ronin; had the B-plot been less involved; etc. then we might have actually had a middling to decent episode. Instead, the writers took the pitch and tried to make it a twisted love story instead of horror. I personally think if Braga had written this one instead of Taylor, it’d probably have been at least 40% better: Braga’s output was uneven but he was a <em>very</em> good writer of horror episodes and other sorts of mindbendy nonsense – ‘Frame of Mind’ and ‘Phantasms’ on TNG, ‘Prey’ and ‘Latent Image’ on Voyager, and several Xindi arc episodes on Enterprise. Taylor, on the other hand, was definitely a good general writer, and IMO her tenure on Voyager produced one of the most consistent periods in that show’s oeuvre, but she also wrote the odd dud – the big one that springs to mind is Voyager’s ‘Elogium’, co-written with Kenneth Biller. If Braga had handled the story from the start, we might have got an interesting, if not necessarily groundbreaking, take on Gothic horror. Instead… we got Sub Rosa.</p>

<p>Is not the part where it involves a ghost doing weird shit with Crusher’s family part of the episode concept?</p>

<p>It’s terrifying to think that the relevant information here is approaching 32 months old (no, 2021 was <em>not</em> 2 years ago), but anyway, a couple months back over on r/AskHistorians I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ybv8rr/is_the_qing_conquest_theory_that_the_qing_dynasty/">answered a question about the ‘Qing conquest theory’</a>, a school of thought primarily in Mainland Chinese historiography that asserts that China’s economy fell behind that of Western Europe in the Early Modern period due to restrictive policies implemented by the Qing (1636-1912). <em>Or is it</em>? Because as I noted in that answer, this appears to have derived entirely from a Wikipedia article written in 2010, whose characterisation of a distinct theory was regarded as dubious <em>very</em> quickly. But the page was never deleted or amended despite several arguments, years apart, and what’s more, the notion of a ‘Qing conquest theory’ has since been brought up in <em>actual academic publications</em>, even if only in passing and usually dismissed, but still forming a citogenesis cycle. The essential issue is that basically, whoever first wrote the article clearly thought that their own characterisation of several distinct pieces of Chinese-language scholarship deserved a neologism to encompass it, rather than wait for any kind of self-identification on the part of the scholars cited. The article is so clearly the pet project of the original author (Teeninvestor, who has not edited either the article or the talk page since August 2010) that its citations have <em>never</em> been updated to include any further scholarship on either side of the supposed debate, while most of its original Chinese citations have been lost due to link rot.</p>

<p>And this is where I draw our attention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Qing_conquest_theory">Wikipedia talk page</a> that chronicles the arguments. Because dear lord, I revisited it today and only just realised how <em>much</em> went on here. The fascinating thing to me is just how <em>long</em> some of these users have been invested in it, coming back to new iterations of the conversation literally years later. Kanguole, the first advocate for removal in August 2010, was one of the last people to contribute to the last thread which concluded in May <em>2021</em>. This person has spent over a <em>decade</em> fighting the good fight against this article and being a consistent voice for its retraction. The runner-up is ch, who was also in the May 2021 thread but was first involved in September 2013, and who has also been pro-deletion but slightly more willing to compromise. Moonraker12, on the other hand, only appeared in May 2021, primarily to defend the article, and rather naturally got themselves embroiled in argument with Kanguole while ch tried to strike a balance. AXONOV couldn’t help putting in their oar too and getting everyone horrendously confused. And all the while, nobody has been able to agree on making any fundamental changes to the article, so there it sits, sowing confusion and uncertainty across the web.</p>

<p>All this to say, boy am I glad I’m not a Wikipedia editor, and also a personal message to Kanguole: keep fighting the good fight!</p>

<p><strong>From Antony Beevor:</strong> “. . . As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine enters the harshest months of the year, there are many indications that this time it may be Russia, rather than its adversary, that suffers the worst consequences. . . . As both sides enter a far more challenging season of fighting, the outcome will largely depend on morale and determination. While Russian troops curse their shortages and lack of hot food, Ukrainian troops are now benefiting from supplies of insulated camouflage suits, tents with stoves, and sleeping bags provided by Canada and the Nordic nations. Putin seems to be in denial about the state of his army and the way that General Winter will favor his opponents. He may also have made another mistake by concentrating his missiles against Ukraine’s energy network and its vulnerable civilian population. They will endure the greatest suffering, but there is little chance that they will break.”</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spinkcat在2022-12-19~2022-12-25的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-25/Spinkcat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spinkcat在2022-12-19~2022-12-25的言论" /><published>2022-12-25T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-25/Spinkcat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-25/Spinkcat/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1925.1</strong> —–2022-12-21 11:50:42+08:00:</p>

<p>我看很多人说统一，但没看到一个具体的说法，到底什么是统一？统一到什么程度才能接受？</p>

<p>通常理解的统一就是国号统一，行政实体是否有必要统一？至少在国内现在香港澳门就是反例。</p>

<p>如果大陆政权进一步改革，政治制度向下放权，香港式的地方政府才是大多数，那就不存在台湾作为一个政治实体需要去权力化，因为地方都一样了。</p>

<p>反过来说，如果是国号统一，以联邦形式存在，也就更没有必要了。</p>

<p>所以归根结底问题就一个，地缘利益如何得到确保，台湾方面没人在乎这个，也给不出一个具体方案。</p>

<p>问题就变成这样推演的：</p>

<p>彻底禁止武统也不寻求刻意统一台湾，放弃对台湾的法理声明，来试图获得台湾的支持和拥簇。</p>

<p>但岛上的事是会变的，一旦变化，之前投入的一切成本都无法回收，没人能保证永远不会变，但是放弃法理长期变成事实，就很难在未来国际秩序下处于一个有利位置。</p>

<p>所以能看得出，统一法理的需求远大于行政实际需求，只要法理统一，哪怕台湾本地保有独立性比大陆更高的行政体系也无所谓。</p>

<p>台湾与大陆最大的对抗目前是民主化与专制的制度性矛盾，但更长远的则是法理和地缘矛盾，对中共来说因为他们的法理来源很不确定且易于被动摇，因此格外针对一中原则。</p>

<p>新政权上台如果是靠内战获胜或选举，各种认受性更高的渠道上台，承认中华民国的客观法理，都是个借坡下驴的好机会。</p>

<p>台湾有人想放弃中华民国法理，这肯定不是新政权能接受的，因为双方有固有的立场，台湾不会放弃自身制度，大陆不会放弃关键的地缘利益，因此承认中华民国法理，基于这个法理进行合邦，在不改变台湾现状的前提下，又保障大陆的地缘利益，这样才能两全其美。</p>

<p>实际无论是台湾，还是大陆，刻意追求解体的人都只是少数，这种观点互联网上能有限度传播，也较前些年有式微迹象，更别提拿到主流社会作为一种主流观点传播。</p>

<p>因为这类观点都是建立在对抗性上，对抗的目的是带来更多对抗，这违背人民群众追求美好生活的朴素愿望。</p>

<p>事实上通过合邦形式构筑一个对双方有共同约束力的法理基础，是对双方来说成本最低，收益最大的办法。</p>

<p>刻意寻求武统台湾，当代粉红很多人是不接受大陆制度的改变，自然不能承认台湾制度的先进性，所以留岛不留人是口头禅，要通过武统证明大陆才是先进的。</p>

<p>但制度上如果我们拥抱他们，大家最后都一样，就不存在要求对方改制的情况，是平等的，仅仅是追求法理统一，而不谋求政权颠覆。</p>

<p>不是大陆人民对台湾有单方面的决定权，而是台湾可以作为全中国诸多的政治实体之一，决定一个十几亿国家人口的走向，并且在其中占据重要一环。</p>

<p>那反过来想，对台湾来讲，到底是一个有十几亿人口的敌意大国在身边，导致经济放不开又不能不依赖，处于比上不足比下有余的窘境更好。</p>

<p>还是能保留先行一切制度，把法理合并后，可以直接参与到这个超级大国的政治决策当中更好？</p>

<p>所以我觉得台湾统一问题不难，第一不以武统为目标，第二要制度上拥抱他们，第三要长期友善往来互信，少数群体互相敌对在全人类历史里一直存在，重要的是多数人能不能往来。</p>

<p>国内政权一变天，只要是自由化与开放化为基础的进行改革，制度和法理对立消失，就可以安全的互通有无，交流多了，没了内宣煽动，我相信大多数人还是能互相接受的，到时候沿海经济还能再发展一波，台湾也会有很多人到大陆定居，比现在估计要多少十几倍。</p>

<p>这样有了良好的基础，没有政治和制度上的利益冲突，才能给合邦打下基础。</p>

<p>到时候台湾是以中华民国的形式与新政权合并，台湾一切不改，还能踢走吃民国政治红利的国民党，本地民进党可以直接成为主流，中华民国历史悠久，但到现在跟国民党挂钩，台湾这面不爱，大陆这面也不亲，里外不是人。</p>

<p>对大陆社会上普遍存在的传统大一统的支持者来说，重新获得中华民国法理，意味着可以声索民国时丢失的领土，虽然可能不切实际，但不考虑地缘利益，只考虑满足口头版图诉求，这也是值得的，非要踢了民国，对台湾还是对大陆都不是好事。</p>

<p>合邦后，中华民国的法理被重新继承，名号消失，皆大欢喜，等于把一个大家不需要但交给合适的人会对双方都有很大用处的东西回收后200%的利用。</p>

<p>因此建立一个能执行这种温和路线的新政权非常有必要，一味寻求对抗，无论对岛内还是大陆都毫无必要。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1925.2</strong> —–2022-12-22 00:48:56+08:00:</p>

<p>大体是这样的，现在卡在中共不消失就无法展开下一阶段的交流这点。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1925.3</strong> —–2022-12-22 21:34:42+08:00:</p>

<p>如果这种非常实际的方案都是过于理想化，那我想不出有什么外力可以肢解一个十几亿人口大国，并且能从文化层面彻底摧毁十四亿人的历史叙事观念，然后来达成一个极少数人希望的结果。</p>

<p>倒不如反过来说，天然认为中国就是不可能或难有改变，这件事本身就是一个伪命题，治权下放就是个社会改革和发展的先验产物。</p>

<p>因为凡事推以秦制唯因的做法，只是同样被一套跟强行大一统类似的叙事观念给套牢，实际就是农业威权社会与工业自由化社会的关系而已，只是社会生产秩序的带来的结果，而不是先有一个“秦制”刻在DNA模板里，所以无论怎么走都是这个结果。</p>

<p>中国人口多，从威权化过渡到自由化肯定是要时间，毕竟凡事不能总想着毕其功于一役，中国十几亿人口不可能退化到原始社会，只要人类不灭亡，社会的生产力和制度就必然进步。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1925.4</strong> —–2022-12-22 23:40:44+08:00:</p>

<p>这就已经是最贴合现实，成本最低的做法了。</p>

<p>因为这是实实在在行事的内容，提出了标准和过程，哪些能做，哪些应该做，哪些不可以做。</p>

<p>就像希望会有一个支持自由化的强力组织一样，有一个强势且能带动自由化的领导集体一样，这些都是所有人都乐于见到的，但是我不会把停留在考虑阶段的观点，作为一个最终结果。</p>

<p>因为大概率是台湾人不会出任何力去帮助中国实现这点，那么他们也自然不可能获得在大陆政治取向的话语权。</p>

<p>所以这不是说要肢解某种叙事观就能做到的事，这是立场利益问题，对台湾人来说很不想要的东西，大陆人可能天然接受，想避免自己不能接受的结果，要么有能力去肢解，要么就是参与其中来尽最大可能避免问题，也就是相向而行。</p>

<p>台湾实际也给不出具体方案希望从中国法理独立，只能是寄希望于中国会怎么样，但是接下来会发生什么，台湾方面给不出一个细节和过程。</p>

<p>希望中国十几亿人口放弃这种历史叙事观念不是说不能产生这种念头，问题在于给不出办法，而不是可不可以做，因为做不到，反而浪费了精力，不如选更有实际意义的方案。</p>

<p>事实上就是要先有一个具体且实际的现实方案，台湾人应尽可能在已知当代绝对不可能消除大一统思潮的前提下，让自己利益最大化。</p>

<p>然后台湾尽最大努力去帮助支持有这种方案，对双方都有利的政治团体、组织，因为台湾人不可能靠自己决定中国状况。</p>

<p>统一是个概念，里面的细节是可以变动兑水的，重点是明白现实的政治利益在哪。</p>

<p>台湾应该尽可能多地用资源去帮助大陆在政治利益、立场上一致，起码没意识形态上绝对矛盾的盟友，胡耀邦和赵紫阳也是要寻求统一台湾的，但是他们跟习近平就不一样，起码统一是个大的命题，怎么统一都是可以谈的，谈不来也不至于敌对。</p>

<p>中国这个主体，脱离控制社会资源的专制政府因素外不会谋求称霸，也不谋求俄罗斯式的新沙皇统治，因为中国的经济已经比俄罗斯要发达太多，正卡在一个社会转型的关键节点，苏联没有这样的发展转型了才导致威权社会的延续。</p>

<p>如果2030-40年代内战结束，出现一个理想政府，但社会仍然在过渡到威权化当中，这个政府会为后续改革和经济转型铺垫，用以奠定民主化和发达化基石，也就是说，问题在于大陆出现混乱后，台湾要支持谁，要在有限的人选里，选出最合适的。</p>

<p>30年对十四亿人来说不算久，实际上我想如果能结束行政和管治权分裂，大陆的转型只需要20年，重点是，如果进入一定概率发生的军阀混战，会拖延很久，那么这时候台湾去帮助，就更有利了，问题是台湾是否已经有这种早期意识。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1926.1</strong> —–2022-12-21 11:59:50+08:00:</p>

<p>那的人我觉得他们绝大部分压根不了解一些事具体是怎么运作的，有些话似乎想说，但因为受限制又无法表达，导致总是无的放矢打空靶，因此任何讨论都无法延伸拓展出一个结果和共识，永远只能停留在一个层次的争吵上，这也是堵嘴导致的国内互联网普遍现状。</p>

<p>一些细节想引入某个实体，比如说中共政策不行要喷，但是没法明说，甚至暗示都不行，就导致逻辑只能推理到政策有问题，有的人会明白这是说中共，有的人不明白就大脑过载永远卡在这开始怪别人了，要进一步延伸讨论中共为什么不行，怎么样的政府才行，这些都是完全无法展开的。</p>

<p>也因为这种深入的逻辑推演无法有效讨论来，让国内社会绝大部分民生和政治议题都被卡住。</p>

<p>这也是为什么红迪的中文社区和推特走的比他们远更多的原因，因此无论是观点、信息还是判断效率，都比墙内的更精准更长远，许多对社会发展的观点和总结都是墙外形成和具体成文的，在墙内也不是完全没雏形，但往往不能明说形成具体观点被传播，黑话也往往只是特定政治立场，黑话太多了就无法组成具体讨论了。（比如鸡叫太阳的说法，我看微博也很多人在是暗喻）</p>

<p>—– <strong>1927.1</strong> —–2022-12-22 01:38:02+08:00:</p>

<p>拨乱反正的背景是建立在毛的嫡系内斗，“外朝”的华国锋和汪东兴、叶等人政变拿掉了“内朝”的四人帮，控制地方文革的保守派别失去中央背书，又无法与华国锋统一立场，华也因为威信不足寻求老干部复出，结果被老干部们从地方到中央逐渐排挤，否则虽然华也会平反部分人，但不会这么彻底。</p>

<p>胡在党内敢第一个吃螃蟹，还是要得益于当时党内的政治背景，权力版图高度分散，他有能吃螃蟹的能力和担当。</p>

<p>现代党内找不到这种人，更别提政治上的高度集权，已经今非昔比。</p>

<p>平反文革和警惕文革式思维回归，恐怕要当代人跳出中共这个体制本身，把他们全都踢走，脱离中共的历史叙事逻辑，单独开辟一套新的历史叙事立场，避免“三七开”再现，毕竟新党派和政权上台，法理来源就是批判中共。</p>

<p>中共这个党的政治生命已经走到尽头了，不改革这群人活不下去，改革了新诞生的组织也就不是中共了。</p>

<p>说明国内当前的政府已经没有先进性可言，他们的一举一动，不说全部，但被预判到的比例越来越高，也反映出他们的财政很难支撑他们玩出什么花样了。</p>

<p>明明大家都知道他们内部高度不透明，全都是黑箱，但许多行为都能被预判，反贼跟开透视挂一样，甚至比反贼们预期的还要拉跨，就今年真是中共法理基础在国内出现分水岭的一年。</p>

<p>说明什么？说明中共运作政府，乃至于命根子维稳那点水平都在剧烈退化。</p>

<p>维稳都做不好，就跟八旗不会骑马一样。</p>

<p>遇到危机，赚钱的本事没有，一刀切的能力到是不少，舆论舆论控制不住，疫情疫情管理不好，要么封到死，要么瞬间转向摆烂，到头来只会三板斧“房地产”、“稳中向好”、“保外贸”，要不就是公职降薪，我听说都有降30%的。</p>

<p>我看照他们这么搞，我原本预期10-15年进入动荡，恐怕没个15年，5-7年就要来了，加速的太快了，反贼纯躺赢，今天白纸社运是走出第一步，明年中共搞不好会反击一波甚至回光返照，但也不怕，见招拆招。</p>

<p>以前说难听点，反贼都是日哭夜哭想哭死董卓，也的确是没什么办法，现在不一样了，大环境彻底变了，不可逆的倒向反贼。</p>

<p>反贼共识和行动力越来越强，内部矛盾逐渐减少，粉红被长期原子化，既然无固定立场，也无组织和行动意愿，中共自己越来越菜，每次观点的被验证，都是政治上有利于反贼的胜利，经济不可逆的下滑趋势下，以后掰手腕的机会多着呢。</p>

<p>维稳是个没上限的增长，而且投入越高收益越低，社会主要还是靠寒蝉效应去压低中共开销。</p>

<p>一旦寒蝉效应没了，维稳的成本会无限增长，所以看猜开销是一回事，重点是要看那些无效开销，尤其是利息，利息是会持续增长，挤兑政府其他良性开销的恶性肿瘤。</p>

<p>不折腾，中共还能细水长流，否则越折腾要投入大量资金，越要增加债务来保证支出的基础，到时候短期债务迅速增长，效果收益低，只能管短期几年特别好用，后续就因为财政工具被玩坏了，没其他手段搞钱去遏制后期规模更大的社会反对声音。</p>

<p>相当于短期打兴奋剂，但问题是对中共来说，这是个长跑比赛，短期跑再快也没用，松懈了就是死。</p>

<p><strong>万亿利息赛跑</strong>，完全可以提出一个这样的指标来作为判断标准，全国政府的债务利息，在一年内有多快达到一万亿，越快达到一万亿，越说明财政问题的严重性。</p>

<p>去年债务利息是有史以来第一次破万亿，2022年11月最新数据已经破万亿，提前完成财政破产的任务。</p>

<p>财政拆东墙补西墙已经越来越困难了，砖块是有折损的。</p>

<p>现实中折损的就是地方政府拿了钱，但是开销到一堆无法产生经济利益，也不能减轻民众负担，甚至花大钱导致经济停滞的现象（典中典的就是雇佣临时人手，再给他们配物资，去各种企业和居家场所强制停工和禁止消费）</p>

<p>平时这种折损则一般是地方政府举债大规模制造垃圾、无效基建，让基建这种高开销回报周期长效益低的产物成为政府带动地方经济的手段，而这些基建本身却又不能生产对应的经济效益。</p>

<p>其他开销都可以压，所以参考价值没债务高，利息不能停，一旦停了，政府的财政会立刻崩溃，所以我们参考债务，而不应该单方面以整体数据为主，要用主要数据与债务的关系来判断中共财政危机的状况和后续发展。</p>

<p>2020年1-10月，地方政府还债金额16242亿元，利息6914亿元</p>

<p>2022年1-10月，地方政府还债金额23304亿元，利息9527亿元</p>

<p>还债金额增长7062亿，利息增长2613亿</p>

<p>2020年1-10月，全国地方财政收入84924亿，利息开销占收入比8.14%（不以支出和赤字为坐标）</p>

<p>2022年1-10月，全国地方财政收入93392亿，利息开销占比10.2%</p>

<p>地方收入增长只有8468亿</p>

<p>因为经济和财政没问题，中央政府这些年是在压缩地方发债空间的，只有地方活不下去了，才会不断开这个口子，避免地方执政危机。</p>

<p>明年会不会是10月？后年9月？每轮转一次，债务大概率翻倍甚至更多，但是地方财政是肯定跟不上的。</p>

<p>想一下，中央政府是个主体，几个直辖市和一些部门，但是地方政府是全国成千上百个小政府，管理绝大部分人口。</p>

<p>他们的年收入总共加在一起才约10万亿浮动</p>

<p>利息已经占了1万多亿，估摸有10%多一些。</p>

<p>地方政府债务：</p>

<p>2020年1-10月是258074亿（25.8万亿）</p>

<p>2021年1-12月是304700亿（30.47万亿，14个月内对比上一年增长4.67万亿，平均每月0.311万亿）</p>

<p>2022年1-10月已经高达351688万亿（35.16万亿，10个月内对比上一年增长4.69万亿，平均每月0.469万亿，如果走满一年每放开，今年增幅可能高达5.63万亿）</p>

<p>也就是说，今年的债务可能到36.1万亿，明年如果还要继续开销支撑经济和地方不遭遇破产潮，破40万亿是大概率事件（当然，各种形式的债务计算，其实今年已经破40万亿了，算隐形债目标可以冲击50万亿）</p>

<p>假设一下，平均还款周期8.5年，利率3.4%</p>

<p>从20年开始算，也就是2028-2030年，疫情高峰的大量债务需要偿还，如果每年保底4万亿的债务增速（不考虑增长和其他变动），2023年开始算40万亿，可以得出这样一个假设趋势：</p>

<p>2023年40万亿</p>

<p>2024年44万亿</p>

<p>2025年48万亿</p>

<p>2026年52万亿</p>

<p>2027年56万亿</p>

<p>2028年60万亿</p>

<p>到时候一年数万亿的利息会是政府开销里的主要构成</p>

<p>疫情之前，2019年地方债务是213072亿（21.3万亿） ，今年可能的债务就高达36.1万亿，落差14.8万亿，到26-28年进入还债早期，每年至少要3万亿起步，进入高峰期28-30年4-5万亿大有希望。</p>

<p>不过最后主要还是看利息，债务在短期内毕竟还是可以继续拆东墙补西墙，因此才要看折损。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1933.3</strong> —–2022-12-23 00:11:58+08:00:</p>

<p>你提的这个观点就是国内考虑到这一步就卡住的困境，没反应过来为何与美日不同的一个经典议论</p>

<p>很多人搞不明白有什么区别，那刚好借这个机会单独说一下，因为一开始我就知道会有这样情况了，其他人看到这没明白可以配合阅读理解。</p>

<p>为什么说中国政府的利息不一样，不能套用其他国家的例子来推论，原因很简单，中国是分税制，地方把收入缴纳上去许多，再按需分配下来。</p>

<p>正常来说，地方政府赚多少钱，花多少，他们应该知道的对吧？通常财权是给其他行政机构控制，而不是政府一手全抓。</p>

<p>我国下级政府花钱和批钱的权力都在手上，他们有KPI，需要带动地方经济，最好的办法就是大规模进行基建，但基建有饱和度，人少的地方一年就赚几千万收入，但是开销可能是几个亿，等于把未来几年的公共财政收入都挤兑了。</p>

<p>这样的地方可能是一个县，一个乡镇而已。</p>

<p>分税制下，下级政府再向上缴纳收入，最后一步步传递到中央，中央再根据他们掌握的情况，把钱返还给地方。</p>

<p>那就出现一个问题，少数大城市可以持续举债，来借新还旧，因为他们有不断的人口涌入，有政策直接支持，产业也能盈利，土地价格高能支持土地财政。</p>

<p>但是成千上百个小地方政府怎么办？</p>

<p>政府不是一个整体，而是成千上百个各级政府组织在一起，最后形成两大体系，一个是中央，一个是地方。</p>

<p>地方的概念比中央大的多，比如说北上广深不怕吃利息，杭州这些二线城市也不怎么怕，那三线的呢？十八线城市和农村地方政府呢？</p>

<p>他们一样是在为了维持经济热度在花钱，并且越是下级政府，花钱的正收益越低。</p>

<p>整体上，整个国家都处于一种过饱和的凯恩斯主义热潮加持，基建是一种开销高，收益低，回报周期长的东西。</p>

<p>就像独山县，你的钱花出去了，债背了，利息也要给，考虑国家信用那更要还钱了。</p>

<p>可是开销却不断增长，地方收入却远远跟不上，只有少数大城市可以通过土地价值和产业来维持平衡。</p>

<p>更具体的想一下就能明白。</p>

<p>1万亿的利息，不是少数城市拿大头其他小城市轻松无压力。</p>

<p>而是你我欠债1个亿，你月收入1亿，我月收入1万，但我可能要还里面的5000万，当然别说5000万，就算100万也还不起。</p>

<p>一二线城市就是月收入最高的城市，而随便一个小地方政府的利息压力，可能就超出了它在公共开支里的安全比例。</p>

<p>通俗易懂的讲，就是会挤兑这些地方的公共财政，让地方实质性进入无政府状态。</p>

<p>中国地方无政府会直接进入到社会动荡状态，因为中共的法理来源本身就不牢靠，他们的管制逻辑里社会跟政府是一种对抗存在，一旦地方没维稳和公共服务，进入动荡，就会有社会运动甚至民间自组织产生。</p>

<p>很多人直接把字面的利息数据简化成地方政府和中央的简单关系，忽略了中国有极大量的城市，大部分债务可能是来自于大多数小型城市。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1933.4</strong> —–2022-12-23 00:54:51+08:00:</p>

<p>中央拿的是优秀税源，等于把地方大部分可以直接转化为资金的收入来源掌控在手里，地方自己拿小头居多。</p>

<p>看一下增值税就知道，中央拿75%，而前些年还进行了营改增，进一步压缩了地方拿到这种优秀税源的比例。</p>

<p>那么就出现一个问题，地方要管理远多于中央的人口，实质性开销很大，它的事权不匹配，又没钱，怎么办？</p>

<p>中央给的方案就是土地财政，因为地是收不上来的，所以不动产里，除了少数更重要的外，其他变现困难的，都给了地方。</p>

<p>这就导致土地财政成为地方经济支柱，然后就出现了资源挤兑，各种超高房价。</p>

<p>为什么中央一定要给地方补贴，因为这是户籍制度与分税制度的组合拳。</p>

<p>如果一个地方入不敷出，那只有两个可能，人口流失导致税源减少，或者花钱的地方太多。</p>

<p>那么就必须反思，中国这些小地方的人口都是净流出为主，钱花哪里去了？人口减少开销却增长，而不见小地方的公共开销占比名列前茅，这就是无效花销，也是许多基建问题的根结。</p>

<p>所以名义上，中央的转移支付是照顾小地方和不发达省份，对吧？</p>

<p>但实际上，为什么不允许人口自由迁徙流动，目前人口净流出，许多最后要无可避免返回原籍，假设人口能自由迁徙，直接去其他地区就可以了。</p>

<p>愿意留下的人，政府的税源减少，但开销也减少了，而不是现在户籍制度上限制的，外出打工但还是绑定其出身所在，公共服务多数与出身绑定。</p>

<p>意味着小地方还要持续花钱，但这些外出的人口不在本地生产和消费。</p>

<p>允许人口自由迁徙，社会的管理成本会大大减少，事权统一匹配，就不会出现管100%的人，但只有50%的权限和30%的收入。</p>

<p>从中共自己宣传的话术，是中央不断支援不发达地区，把70%的收入给补上了。</p>

<p>但问题在于，一开始70%的缺口就是中央自己制造出来的，全国都要服从分税制，然后再统一按比例发回，不发达地区也要交钱，只是多少和返还的区别而已。</p>

<p>那一开始就应该允许不发达的地区人口自由迁徙。</p>

<p>中共的做法形象类比是什么呢？</p>

<p>不发达地区的人口和公共福利不对称，人口无法迁徙，导致一个月需要500元才能勉强活，想发展必须有600元，而他们自己能赚到400元，中央从其他地区包括不发达地区收缴一部分。</p>

<p>400元要抽走200元，然后再返还给该地区300元，相当于该地区有100元收入增长，但只够凑合活着，不够发展。（更夸张的比喻就是赚500，收你400然后返还给你凑够500，只是钱走了一次流程而已，但你失去的是400元的财权不能自由支配）</p>

<p>如果人口自由迁徙和地方事权放开，地方政府需要处理的人口少，开销也少，不需要说75%的增值税收入都需要上缴，然后必须去转头搞举债和土地财政才能维持政府运转，起码是可以自负盈亏，大凉山待不爽了就去上海，落地一样享受上海的一切国民公共服务。</p>

<p>中央分税制的逻辑，就是强干弱枝，避免地方经济发达后做大，通过收缴财权，然后控制财权去针对性“扶贫”，给一些地区的支付转移，其实只够该地区凑合运作而已，不会给超预期的资金。</p>

<p>最重要的是，不会给这些地方放权，举例子发达的老工业省份辽宁，辽宁一切底子都不错，但是因为事权不匹配，一直发展不起，年轻人口只能外逃。</p>

<p>那为什么不改革呢，因为中央对这个省份有自己的定位，他认为你该这个水平，该不该发展，都是他主观决定的，而不是一切放开凭借各自努力的八仙过海各显神通，不会也不乐意提供行政资源放权。</p>

<p>同理，对其他不发达地区使用转移支付也是一个逻辑，也就是说分税制只是方便中央的一种工具，并不是迫切需求的。</p>

<p>如果中央把所有收缴上来的财权和资金，全部用在落实到具体小地方的细节上，就会失去经济优势，导致地方有钱可以做大。</p>

<p>到时候就是谁有钱谁就是中央，现在只是通过政治体制，和一贯的先发优势去强制地方上缴财权，限制人口自由流动，来让这套体系配合巩固政权对社会、中央对地方的管制优势。</p>

<p>一旦地方拒绝上缴财权，小地方政府无法管理地方，导致无政府化，户籍制度就无法继续执行，分税制也会瓦解，所以通过分税制确保户籍制度稳定，从而让农村人口不断成为城市的廉价劳动力是很有必要的事。</p>

<p>那如果最后这种左手倒右手的玩法，中间里面的折损越来越大，出现拆东墙补不过来西墙，某个环节逐渐出问题，户籍开始崩溃，社会进入动荡，问题就来了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1933.5</strong> —–2022-12-23 01:35:56+08:00:</p>

<p>最基本的一个概念，宪法规定的公共服务不以你的出身所在为判断依据去执行。</p>

<p>区别的只有地方、私有化服务而已，区别只是符合资格与否，美国没有广义免费医疗，但也不会说因为你是南方州出身，到北方州就不享有国民基本待遇。</p>

<p>一个地方可能会因为治权不同，有地方的待遇差异，但是国家层面，从中央政府角度，去下放标准必须要做到公平，人们有选择权，去自己想去和能去的地方，然后遵从地方的法律与行政规则，就是这么简单。</p>

<p>重点是，没有限制自由迁徙的合理性与合法性。</p>

<p>举例子，农民现在被限制迁徙自由，有更好的服务了吗？更好的教育？更好的医疗？</p>

<p>没有，户籍制度让出身大概率决定农民子弟一辈子的走向，哪怕你作为农民在城市工作生产价值，子女也一般是读农民工子弟学校，这还有什么公有制的价值需要坚持？</p>

<p>别人私有化是在公共服务普及的基础上，你起码得做到公平，保证下限。</p>

<p>而且自由迁徙是个人意愿，那一个人就是乐意从上海迁徙到纽约的黑人社区上中学，那是他自己的事，轮不着你我管。</p>

<p>难道把一个想到城市读书的孩子，限制在农村或农民工子弟学校，连给他摸到门槛的机会都不提供，称得上公平吗？起码出身不决定他能触及的下限。</p>

<p>我不明白资源有限所以有钱人更公平两者的逻辑在哪。</p>

<p>你花钱购买私人教育与医疗资源是个人的事，公共服务层面保障国民的基本权力，有什么关联？</p>

<p>户籍并不保障你的资源多少，城市人口只是明面享受，但本质也是被压榨的对象，土地财政一条把城市人口吃的死死的。</p>

<p>它只决定个人在剥削链里的位置，是一种人为的种姓制度，刻意划分一条隐性阶级，为政权的稳固和方便管理服务。</p>

<p>人口涌入的不是外国人，而是自己的国民，我们不能这样区别对待自己的国民和同胞。</p>

<p>再有就是，人口本身也是创造价值和生产的来源，有基本的公共服务，不代表生活不需要成本。</p>

<p>开放了反而代表如果一个农民要享受一线城市的一切福利待遇，也必须承受当地的一切生活成本，重点是你要给他选择权，他愿意省吃俭用，也要让后代享受本地资源，那是他的事，我们没权力说不让他这么做。</p>

<p>我不但有观点，我还敢说我能解决，也有具体方案，大部分人刚开始接触这些话题的担忧和错误理解，我都做过很多详细的拓展讨论，写过很多了，尤其是农村改革话题，有兴趣可以去看看，会对你了解这个话题有帮助。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1933.6</strong> —–2022-12-23 10:27:46+08:00:</p>

<p>你这个逻辑不过关，我甚至没明白你具体想要表达什么，因为都跟话题不搭边了。</p>

<p>国民基本权力跟有多少人可以无视教育资源不平衡是两个概念。</p>

<p>因为你都没搞明白一件事，就是社会总资源并不是不变的，也不是因为开放了所以就会被永久性挤兑了。</p>

<p>就像你说黑人区，问题是黑人区的每个人都有权力离开，除了黑人区还有华人区、西班牙人区、墨西哥人区，这只是文化社群，有实质性差异的只有穷人区和富人区。</p>

<p>但是禁止人口迁徙，是一种要求你不许这样做的强制性措施，是一种通过公权力行政强制约束的产物。</p>

<p>而且更让人搞不懂的是，取消户籍制度，明明主要受益者是收入更低的广大农民，他们有迁徙自由，意味着行政资源部与土地捆绑，【 公有制教育和医疗努力做到不以金钱来区别人 】，那么按这个说法就是我国努力用出身区别人咯。</p>

<p>就像你这种明显有问题的描述一样【 还有 真的有天赋的人，能够从高考中脱颖而出，这从来就不是问题. 高考的含金量你还不相信吗？ 】</p>

<p>用后脚跟去想，我们都知道一个学生在不同地区加分也不同，这是常识吧。</p>

<p>甚至乎我们不去说加分这些问题，单独说地方师资，公立行政资源都故意倾向于少数地区，但是这些地区农民无权让子女在这些地方扎根，私立教育也读不起。</p>

<p>因为行政设计的目标不包括给大多数农民的原籍提供认受性高的职业学校，或者是小到高的学校资源，等于把所有路都堵死了。</p>

<p>因此我国才有凤凰男这种群体存在，大量的学生，有资源不去带动他们在小地方的发展，做到尽可能公平，非要集中到少数地区，然后把极少数零星爬出来的当大多数例子，搁着养盅呢？</p>

<p>有这个必要非得限制农民获得的教育资源吗？</p>

<p>有钱人能上什么大学还是私立学校都无关乎一个公共服务的下限，教师扎堆但受教育人口不扎堆，结果就是教师内卷，学生也被迫内卷，城里往死卷，农民子弟上大学纯粹看天，就没有说普普通通正常上学受教育就能安稳进入大学的环境，也没有说不上大学，但是职业教育的含金量很高的体系接盘。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1933.7</strong> —–2022-12-23 10:44:57+08:00:</p>

<p>【 就和我说的一样，你的说法变不出额外的社会资源给涌入的人口，解决不了问题你说什么？ 】</p>

<p>我看到过很多这种完全无法理解的描述。</p>

<p>我给你做个问答就能理清了：</p>

<p>社会的资源和人口，难道在户籍改变前就有变化么？没有。</p>

<p>都没有变化，之前有没有需要额外资源的地方？没有。这个担心本身就是莫名其妙嘛。</p>

<p>有的只是人口流向的变化，更科学，因为一个人能生活在哪，想生活在哪，本身就是一个先验的反应。</p>

<p>农民是不是说进城了，城里人就没书读？没医生看？不是。</p>

<p>为什么？</p>

<p>一个农民到城市里是无法耕地的，那么只能转型成为劳动力，劳动力意味着他有在生产，只要他能承担这个地区的生活成本，那么就是在给整个城市的税收和经济活动增值。</p>

<p>也就是说，有更多税源=更多医疗资源=更多教育资源。</p>

<p>只要不是年老不能工作或者小孩子纯粹脱产，现代社会就是一个人的产出必然大于个人消费与公共服务的开销。</p>

<p>更进一步说人口涌入的立场不切实际。</p>

<p>会不还有人口涌入？会。</p>

<p>但会是什么形式的？以更合理的形式。</p>

<p>住不起北京的人，会去住郊区，老师也是人，医生护士也是人，如果所有人都扎堆在核心密集地区，老师在一个地区的密度过高，职业竞争压力就大，一个地区内生源数量增长是有限的，那你非要卷进来10个老师，教师这个行当就没有客观收益，也就更没人愿意去做。</p>

<p>而因为户籍制度限制人口迁徙，占据大部分人口的农村环境恶劣，教师很难也不乐意去那里发展，这也是为何我国卫星城市发展不好，总是比较大的核心区域之间连接，而不是东京都市圈那样。</p>

<p>医生资源同理，人口散开了，没有必须扎堆到一起的必要，极少数核心土地的价值就会降低，毕竟土地开垦是有极限的，北京再牛逼不能把天津也变成一个北京市天津区，所以只能吸血，并且扩张到极限，就要挤兑劳动力到其他城市通勤回来。</p>

<p>北京土地开垦到极限，就会出现天价房租、房价的问题，提高一切在北京核心地区工作的人的生活成本，很多老师和医生都是外地来的，你提高他们生活成本，他们也想跑，可是没地方去，要是突然出现一个成熟且人口多的卫星城市，老师和医生去了都是卖方市场，只会赚的更多。</p>

<p>不是说跟北京核心地区一样，一群医生老师扎堆，变成买房市场，官方想怎么给你减薪和压低你待遇你都只能听话。</p>

<p>用蜡笔小新做个户籍制度的形象对比，野原广志是秋田县出身的人，他可以到东京工作，但是不能完全享有东京的所有待遇，如果他在春日野市买房，小新的教育就要跟东京的学生区别开来，包括买房、买车和医疗等。</p>

<p>但是没有户籍制度的话，结果就是野原家不买东京都市圈内的房子，仅仅是因为太贵了，没有户籍制度人口也会聚集，但是会根据承担能力分散在一定范围内。</p>

<p>政府需要做的是拆开行政机构，牵动企业避免扎堆进而导致就业扎堆，并且铺垫好卫星城市，让短距离通勤合理，或者能做到行政企业迁离，通勤都可以避免。</p>

<p>所以总结很简单，之前有的资源没出问题，涌入了也不会出问题，因为国内的总人口没变，也不是外国人一次性移民几百万，空降人口才会导致资源挤兑。</p>

<p>你想下，日常农民工病了和子女读书，也是在本地，只不过待遇更差而已，而不是很多人莫名其妙以为的好像农民工之前从来没在城市使用过公共服务，问题在于不公平，这回懂了吧。</p>

<p>【 户籍等于种性控制，几年不来大陆变外宾还是从来没来过？ 你问一下身边，有任何人在日常生活，政府事务中有户籍隐含歧视吗？ 】</p>

<p>这就真离谱了，我远的都不用说什么车牌买房养老金这些基本民生的（当然我还是要吐槽下农民养老金许多才一百多一个月）</p>

<p>就看看最近被骂的最恨的，北京一圈给北京输血，这是什么特供待遇，北京本身吸血的事被骂的还少么，河北怎么看北京的，北京的爷就是爷，别不服服气是不是。</p>

<p>国内允许一定程度落户的前提，有的甚至比一些地区移民都难，是高度具备筛选性的，要求长期有工作且不能简短，并且有居住地址申报等一系列要求，这都是门槛，农民工哪有稳定工作，房子现在大学生都租不起，普通技术工种有城中村就不错了，深圳几十人宿舍见过吗，三和大神也听过吧。</p>

<p>农民工子弟学校怎么专门盖给农民工吗？农民怎么就得用中药注射液这种东西去降低医疗成本，使用的医疗耗材都不如城市，我看你是没关注过，不清楚具体问题，别说农村，城市之间的隔离问题都很严重。</p>

<p>所以别说什么【 除了教育就不会遇到其他任何户籍麻烦 】，真想了解，自己搜一下都知道这是建国以来就有的社会问题，以前是对农民征收公粮喝要钱，后来开始收缴生产工具，改革开放后户籍制就是农村、城市双轨制，农民甚至没农产品的全面自主定价权。</p>

<p>有钱就能落户谁不知道，农民和乡镇人口哪来的钱和稳定工作达到那么高的标准？</p>

<p>我给你举个例子，合法情况下，北京需要社保交够平均约十五年，香港只需要生活七年就能拿永久身份享受一切资源，北京光工作十五年还不行，待着也不行，香港只要你能合法上街和呼吸就可以。</p>

<p>日本移民到标准了也才要求五年或以上交税和十年签证。</p>

<p>用后脚跟咱们想一下，你现在到底是限制有钱人落户，还是限制平民，尤其是广大农民落户。</p>

<p>我都不明白这种压根站不住脚的伪命题观点怎么现在流传这么广。</p>

<p>好好看我内容，长但都是在讲解，这种事不可能说一句话就解释全部了，要讨论和推进必须接受这种门槛。</p>

<p>怎么没想明白一个问题呢？我再给你简化一点。</p>

<p>现在上海就已经有无数外来人口，其中农民占相当多，他们承担本地廉价劳动力这个角色，不可能脱离他们运转，他们也在使用本地公共资源，有没有因为这些人的进入垮掉？没有。</p>

<p>为什么全中国的农民不是都去上海，而是分布在不同地方？因为农民也要遵从资本主义市场的就业规则和规律，生活成本高就必须有工作，但一个地方承担的就业市场是有极限的。</p>

<p>在使用公共资源前，他们首先需要吃饭，吃不起饭，住不起房，他根本就留不住，人在城市都站不住脚，怎么可能还要到使用公共资源的时候？</p>

<p>难道农民到其他地方就不是用了？只要农民活着，他就是得使用公共资源啊，根本不是某个地方的问题，制度统一了，你在新疆就不用花公帑吗？不也是要花么。</p>

<p>而且农民转型，只要他的收入足够站得住脚，他自己也愿意承担这个成本，那就说明他的产出效益足够供养更多的教师和医生来让公共服务扩大。</p>

<p>上海财政哪来的？你问过自己没。</p>

<p>是人啊，人生产资源供给财政，不是天上掉下来的，人口越多生产资源规模越多，决定人去哪的是经济和发展前景，但物价是越靠近核心区越贵。</p>

<p>不是让所有人都去上海，而是全国统一化，那上海除了传统的大城市经济和就业优势外，公共福利上有什么优势吗？就是因为摊平了没特殊性了，不需要往里挤了，要不然现在问题就是户籍制度在故意制造原籍都无法正常生活的困境，把人往城里撵，才导致资源挤兑，然后靠户籍这道墙，减少对城市阶级的影响。</p>

<p>还有个问题就是中共这个集团从公务还是私人、家族层面都不合理的占用资源过多，问题就在于不患寡。</p>

<p>是在说他们都是一个独立的政治实体，但外人要移民进去居然比我们国家内部迁徙都要容易。</p>

<p>你瞧瞧你自己说的是什么，你直接歪到说去移民日本和香港让他们试试，可问题是他们可不是跟北京上海一样，他们没有有责任和天然义务需要去接纳外来人口。</p>

<p>但是北京和上海有天然义务，因为大陆政权是一个整体。</p>

<p>我一合计你这个逻辑出发点就好像北京上海是不需要对这些人口负责的，但你会要求不需要负责的其他政治实体来负责，从而去给必须有责任负责到底的城市找借口。</p>

<p>大概意思就是”你看，他们肯定不开放，所以我们也不能“，那问题有脑子都明白他们不开放是因为没责任，我们不开放是什么，是因为我们贱吗？喜欢剥削自己同胞？</p>

<p>都不仔细看我打字，还一个劲问为什么和没回复，气人不气人，我再说一次，你有不懂没明白就仔细看完问。</p>

<p>全国性质的公共服务是中央政府出钱，地方的公共服务是通过当地纳税人缴税后形成的。</p>

<p>我前面就吐槽过你了，怎么十倍人口就是全部脱产？全都是最吃公共服务的老人和小孩？</p>

<p>一个单位的人口，他自身的生产就能至少达成两个目标：</p>

<p>1.保证自身生存</p>

<p>2.产生的消费或税金可以用于供给政府运作</p>

<p>也就是说人口越多，地方政府的收入越高，可以用于地方公共服务的资金越高，所以人口自由迁徙，自己决定哪里合适，无论走到哪都有全国性公共服务兜底，自己在地方工作交税，进入地方福利体系进行二级保障。</p>

<p>现在国内是什么情况？</p>

<p>以医疗为例，是有一批人在公共体系内，吃了超额资源，这部分资源从哪来的？</p>

<p>一部分剥削是城市人口，另一个是剥削农村人口。</p>

<p>谁吃的？中共这个既得利益集团，老干部一个月几十万上百万的往里砸钱续命抢救，挤兑本来不宽裕的公共资源。</p>

<p>再有一个，经济上户籍制度约束人口流动性，已经导致内需消费起不来，农民无法进入城市落户转型为城市人口继续带动消费。</p>

<p>这套制度中共喜欢用，是因为可以制造大量廉价劳动力，管理廉价劳动力的成本和风险，比管理产业升级过程里出现的大量技术型知识分子和中产要安全多。</p>

<p>嗯？</p>

<p>农民一个月退休金一百多元，城市几千元，你告诉我消费什么？他连活着都成问题，农业定价权不给放开，老了地也种不动，希望离开原籍务工，因为户籍制度本身就是在限制所有农民的原籍生存能力。</p>

<p>导致农民都要出来务工，直接变成买方市场，进而导致老年劳动力被淘汰，你告诉我怎么消费，没钱就没法消费呗，不消费？是不消费啊，岂止农民消费不起，城市人也消费不起了。</p>

<p>内需都什么德性了？</p>

<p>跟户籍制度相辅相成的分税制，直接导致土地财政问题，提高农民外出务工成本，也提高城市人口消费成本</p>

<p>而在这种合理性上，同样是迁徙，怎么中国境内城市迁徙比迁徙到境外的难度都要高。</p>

<p>其他地区迁徙难度高是因为他们不需要对境外的人负责，没这个义务。</p>

<p>【 什么落户都比不过我问一句， <strong>上海需要供养的人口突然增长十倍，他能变出10倍的社会资源吗？就这个财政供养10倍的人口社会资源的质量</strong>难道就能达到以前吗？ 】</p>

<p>我们可以看到几个关键词和谬误的重点。</p>

<p>首先【<strong>上海需要供养的人口突然增长十倍，他能变出10倍的社会资源吗？</strong>】</p>

<p>这是基本连社会常识都没有，上海财政的来源，包括外地人口。</p>

<p>人口增长只要不是完全脱产的老人和孩子，都会带动经济效益，政府自己不赚钱，都是靠税收，各地政府提供公共服务，是因为当地人口进行生产带来的税金支持。</p>

<p>其次【<strong>财政供养10倍的人口社会资源的质量</strong>】</p>

<p>我觉得这点提及质量，就把你真实观点露出来了。你追求的本质是不平等，担心损害道自己的利益。</p>

<p>中国一二线城市人口总数也才2亿多，不到3亿，难道你觉得是这些人口带来了全国资源，对其他地区进行支付转移去维持全国的公共服务吗。</p>

<p>如果你的答案为”是“，那你的论证就破产，因为按照你的逻辑，既然是的话，意味着2-3亿人口就可以供给全国起源12-11亿人的公共服务。</p>

<p>如果你的答案为”不是“，也即是承认大多数非一二线城市的农村乡镇人口是中国财政收入的主要来源，公共福利制度是建立在剥削他们之上，才能给一二线带来超水平的服务。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>例子D（数学认知水平问题）：</p>

<p>【 <strong>本来就是为了解决质量问题</strong>，你这样迂回搞是不是太扯了？ 】</p>

<p>综上所述，我的默认观点就是少数人不可能创造出绝大多数人的资源。</p>

<p>公共服务的质量不公平，一二线好，三线或城乡结合部到农村逐级下降，往下约等于没有。</p>

<p>占据11-12亿人口的主流，得不到公平的公共服务质，还要受歧视性政策影响医疗与子弟。</p>

<p>请问你所谓的公平性何在，你要解决的质量手段何在。</p>

<p>你毫无手段、计划与目标，因为你根本不知道自己在说什么，只是为了抬杠回答，如果出发点是谈户籍制度的公平问题这点，那你屁股就是歪的，相当于默认这群人应该被剥削。</p>

<p>现在我说要取消户籍制度，让这些人以前没有的，现在拥有，一二线过去的超额公共福利会消失，换来的是更多人的公平，你能反驳什么。</p>

<p>很多地方你都没常识。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>例子E（常识性问题）：</p>

<p>比如【 大家一起<strong>吃大锅饭</strong>就算解决问题了？ 是不是搞笑？ 】</p>

<p>你有没有哪怕一点社会常识。</p>

<p>到底谁吃大锅饭，敢不敢解释清楚。</p>

<p>农民不工作？农民不生活消费？农民不进行生产？</p>

<p>（我惊讶的是你都答不出来，因为你只是不敢回答，那只能说明你心知肚明，知道自己是站在既得利益者立场，说不出任何道理来，如果你是真的不知道，那就是纯粹没常识。）</p>

<p>中国按比例算，现在纯农民至少还有3亿人，行政划分居住乡镇的人口超过40%，如果算城乡结合部、外出打工的人口的广义农村出身，中国该阶级有超过9亿人口，占据大多数。</p>

<p>谁是多数，谁是少数，到底是一二线享受户籍制度红利的人吃农民的大锅饭，还不让农民吃。</p>

<p>还是一二线不到3亿的人口创造99%的税收，农民跑来吃大锅饭。</p>

<p>我说你这种举例子就是垃圾例子，而不是反过来说因为国际移民是这样的，所以国内这样也没问题.</p>

<p>你这语文能力是不是需要提高啊？】</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>回复B：</p>

<p>【 <strong>户籍政策是这样一个道理吗？ 懂了吗</strong> （第二次，但是依旧没给出任何实质性内容）</p>

<p>你…我被你气死了，我在国内用这样的表述没人不懂的（完全没任何内容让别人懂，你是不是有点问题），在这里和你交流咋那么费劲？</p>

<p><strong>户籍政策是一个道理吗？</strong> （第三次，依然看不到任何实质性阐述。）<strong>这句话联系上文理解不能</strong>（压根就没上文，更没内容），我觉得真的有代沟了.</p>

<p>tm我说的是<strong>国际移民政策和国内户籍立意就完全不一样</strong>（宁肯复读三次，也不愿意说出到底哪里立意不同），所以<strong>根本就无法比较.</strong>（你不给出你对户籍的理解和观点，自然无法比较）】</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>回复C：</p>

<p>【 你说的很明白了 移民政策是在一群不当人的人里挑选优质人口补充 户籍政策是需要对所有人负责.</p>

<p><strong>你告诉我立意就不同，怎么比较？</strong>（那么你对国内户籍的具体立意、执行和细节内容在哪？你都没内容，当然没法比较，我提出的户籍制度我可以比较，你能吗？）</p>

<p>在移民官员眼里外国人就不是人系列，<strong>户籍能这样打算吗？</strong>（明明我一开始就说了是这样没错，请问你的观点和反驳内容呢？）</p>

<p>移民政策无从讨论公平问题，因为外国人根本就不配获得本国人的待遇，只有挑选的份.</p>

<p><strong>而在户籍政策里公平就是最大的因素.</strong>（抛出一个没常识的暴论，然后不需要论证。这样行为你真的以为我没注意到？非要我给你摆在面前让你难堪？）</p>

<p><strong>这能比？</strong>（请你先拿出国内的所谓公平制度在哪，你什么都不给，藏着掖着。我是已经亮出来了。）</p>

<p><strong>还有你总是扯几十年的老黄历…现在人讨论户籍还会扯这些玩意？</strong>（扯什么玩意，具体哪些，请你反驳一下，不说就是没有，无的放矢而已，自己打虚空靶子。）</p>

<p><strong>是不是外宾了？</strong>（请问我积极在讨论户籍制度，这三个回复里你完全没提及户籍制度本身，而是不断问我是这样吗，是这样吗，不正是反应你自己不知道么，那么谁才是外宾。）</p>

<p>最后，<strong>我解释的 没有人不理解 你这里直接跳过是什么意思？</strong>（因为你根本什么都没说，只有观点无论据，连续三次都是如此。）</p>

<p><strong>你理解的东西和我说的完全是俩个东西…</strong>（你连说的到底是什么，怎么样的一个户籍制度，它的过程、目标与合理性，从来都没在你嘴里得到过论述与证实，我在用客观事实进行阐述对比，你什么都没有，所以这里只有我提到的内容，没看到你说的。）】</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>回复D：</p>

<p>【 众所周知，<strong>汉语断句甚至逆反语序是不影响阅读的</strong></p>

<p>你这在中文论坛讨论什么语序，我不光是在质疑你用什么语言二次过滤文本，也质疑你是不是在用chat机器人搞事情. 】</p>

<p>你连判断问题的基础，都是来自于其他人质问你为什么不说论证过程。</p>

<p>然后其他人要求你说论证过程，你就说别人不理解。</p>

<p>从一开始有问题的就是你不肯说出论证过程，莫名其妙得出一个观点，你可以说是主观感受，但我们讨论的是客观现实。</p>

<p>你必须拿出实质性的东西，而不是嘴巴上无限反问:</p>

<p>【<strong>户籍政策是一个道理吗？</strong>】</p>

<p>【<strong>户籍政策是这样一个道理吗？ 懂了吗 ？</strong>】</p>

<p>【<strong>这能比？</strong>】</p>

<p>【<strong>户籍能这样打算吗？</strong>】</p>

<p>【<strong>立意就不同，怎么比较？</strong>】</p>

<p>【<strong>根本就无法比较.</strong>】</p>

<p>从头到尾，只听到你反问和否定，但是没有任何关于你在这些回复内提及户籍制度本身内容的论述。</p>

<p>我完全可以无限反问：</p>

<p><strong>【户籍政策怎么不是一个道理？】</strong></p>

<p><strong>【户籍政策怎么不是这样一个道理，懂了吗 ？】</strong></p>

<p><strong>【这怎么就不能比？】</strong></p>

<p><strong>【户籍怎么不能这样打算？】</strong></p>

<p><strong>【立意就相同，怎么就不能比较？】</strong></p>

<p><strong>【根本就无法比较.】（甚至都不用改）</strong></p>

<p>基于这一点，你说的【 讲了很多语法真的笑死人了 】实际就是在笑话你自己。</p>

<p>首先，因为你不给出论据和论证过程，无限反问就是避开正面说内容。</p>

<p>然后，别人质问，你又以为是对方没理解你说话，得出是别人二次机翻的荒谬结论（就是我无法理解的是，你有工夫得出这种结论，却没时间解释户籍制度的内容是为什么。）</p>

<p>最后，问题是来自于你自己。</p>

<p>真相大白了？明白了？</p>

<p>然后你还能说出：</p>

<p>【 我都还没开始去讨论你回复<strong>牛头不对马嘴</strong>，你来讨论我这个不影响理解的问题？</p>

<p>在境内论坛很容易被人理解，在这里咋就变无法辨识？ 我只能说机器翻译就是那么垃圾.】</p>

<p>因为压根就不是我不对马嘴，你说我回复不对，却毫无意识是自己根本没给出任何对户籍制度的解释。</p>

<p>【<strong>户籍政策里公平就是最大的因素</strong>】</p>

<p>这是违反社会基本常识的话，你都不肯展开一下，那就不怪我咯，我一直要求你解释。</p>

<p>谁的问题？不是你自己的，难道是我的？</p>

<p>是你自己越说话越轻浮，难道要反怪我揪着你不放没给你台阶下？</p>

<p>—– <strong>1933.43</strong> —–2022-12-25 03:37:48+08:00:</p>

<p>事情非常简单，捋下过程：</p>

<p>结论就是，你从前面开始，在对比其他国家和地区对外国人的迁徙政策时，反复说立意不同，用反问句，但不给出任何解释。</p>

<p>正常交流，反问的前提就是你必然有一个属于自己的观点和看法，既然你要否定，就拿出你的论据和论述，展示给我看。</p>

<p>但你没这么做，而是反复就这么一句话。</p>

<p>跟着我要求你回复，是你卡在这，不是我。</p>

<p>得出一个荒谬的别人是机器二次翻译，你没毛病吧？</p>

<p>既然你非要回复我，说我是暴论，非说立意不一样，国内户籍和国外的情况不是一个道理，那你就得给你想怼的这个人好好解释你的观点。</p>

<p>然后把你的观点、论据、论述过程，全都展示出来。</p>

<p>这件事就这么简单。</p>

<p>到了你该论述的时候，你不去做这件事了，问题自然在你身上。</p>

<p>你讲不出来，我完全接受，那就不说，我也没什么要说的，我想说的前面都说完了。</p>

<p>你持续回复，说明你还是能说且想说的，可没有任何实质性反驳。那我就不理解你为什么之前不说，现在才来说了。（这个质疑目前还没成立，但你接话茬解释那一刻就成立了。）</p>

<p>我回复这么多，就是要把这件事给你捋清楚，咱们就是实事求是，别搞得好像我冤枉你。</p>

<p>Wikipedia editors can be notoriously bad at distorting secondary sources, especially because the site’s policy of ‘balance’ can lead to fringe academia being presented as a legitimate challenge to mainstream consensus. I get this a <em>lot</em> with Qing history issues (my primary field), as Wikipedia articles tend to heavily push the ‘Sinicisation’ thesis, which is still backed by a number of Chinese historians and more traditionalist-minded historians in the West, but which is basically discredited among basically every specialist in the field post-1990. There’s also a case where Wikipedia <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ybv8rr/is_the_qing_conquest_theory_that_the_qing_dynasty/itkm8nr/">invented a historiographical school from thin air</a> in the case of the ‘Qing conquest thesis’, which as far as I’m aware is an attempt to synthesise a handful of Chinese articles from 2005 to 2010 (all of which are now inaccessible due to link rot) and argue that they form a cohesive position. You also get cases like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaxa_(state\)">Jaxa</a>, in which there are citations of some Polish secondary sources that seem to suggest the existence of a real state called Jaxa, but there are no links to digitised versions that would make it possible for someone to easily check if the claims being made are genuine.</p>

<p>So yes, Wikipedia requires you to cite secondary sources, but it has no mechanisms for ensuring that you aren’t misrepresenting what your citations say.</p>

<p>I will not stand for any slander against Wade-Giles. W-G is a perfectly cromulent way of rendering 19th century Beijing Mandarin using the phonetic conventions of English orthography, and as a result is much less likely to create confusion over pronunciation for English-speakers. What it also emphasises is that Mandarin consonants tend to have <em>aspirated/unaspirated</em> distinctions rather than voiced/unvoiced, which Pinyin ironically obscures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it’s quite hard to imagine Satsuma and Chōshu defeating forces many times their size without modern rifles and artillery</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admittedly this is outside my usual specialism, but my impression is that at both the strategic and the tactical level, both the numerical advantage and technological disadvantage of Bakufu forces seem to be overstated. According to Hōya Tōru’s chapter in <em>The Meiji Restoration: Japan as a Global Nation</em>, Satsuma and Chōshū each fielded around 11,000 modernised troops, while the Bakufu itself had 24,000 modernised troops (though this figure doesn’t account for allies like Aizu); in the same book Harold Fuess relays figures from Nanbō Heizō indicating that the overall Tokugawa alliance had around 75,000 rifles compared to 60,000 for the restorationists (presumably both sides were acquiring considerable numbers of spares). Both figures seem to suggest a higher absolute number of not just troops in general but indeed rifle-armed ones on the part of the Tokugawa forces, but one that was not overwhelming.</p>

<p>On the tactical side of things, I am mostly going off Totman here, but I went through his numbers at one stage and it seems like the actual forces committed at the battle of Toba-Fushimi, which seems to be the one real point of reference we have to go on, were much closer to parity than the superficial figures suggest, although in a way this slices both ways. Wikipedia opts to present the numbers as 5000 vs 15000 or a 1:3 ratio favouring the Tokugawa forces, but doesn’t specify how; my own count from Totman would put the Sat-Chō force at 3500 at absolute minimum if we include the defection of Tsu, while only 6000 or so troops from the Bakufu expeditionary force were actually committed during the battle, which means less than 1:2 in their favour. That said, of those 6000 or so, it seems like nearly 3000 of those were modernised <em>hohei</em> or <em>sappei</em> forces, which would mean that until Tsu’s defection, the definitely modernised components of the Bakufu force outnumbered the entirety of the then-extant Sat-Chō forces, which presumably had at least some less well-equipped allied contingents besides the more modernised ones from Satsuma, Chōshū, and presumably Tosa and Saga.</p>

<p>Given the seeming technological parities, Toba-Fushimi seems less a triumph of superior equipment and more of superior positioning: during the first phase of the battle, Sat-Chō were mainly defending river crossings, and Tsu were fortuitously deployed in a position to cut the Tokugawa line of retreat when they defected. Even then there seem to have been considerable risks taken on the imperial side: from what I gather, effectively all of their reserves in Kyōto were committed following the first day’s fighting, which would have left them extremely inflexible, and it was fortuitous that it seems like the Bakufu commanders didn’t really start moving reserves up from Yodo until they were already being counterattacked and losing the initiative. This may just be Totman trying to be generous to the Bakufu of course, but my read at least seems to be that the battle was decided by command decisions rather than arms shipments.</p>

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>—– <strong>996.1</strong> —–2022-12-22 12:21:55+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first thing you have to understand is that Marco Polo didn’t write anything. The Travels of Marco Polo (originally titled Description of the World) was written by Rustichello da Pisa, an Italian author who is otherwise known for writing about Arthurian legends, who was in prison with Polo for a while. The accuracy of his recordings of the stories Polo told him is, in a broad sense, perfectly reasonable, but exact details can be sketchy, it’s generally assumed and understood that Rustichello was punching up the descriptions POlo gave him. Unless you’re reading Rustichello’s original text in the original Franco-Venetian, it then had to go through one or more translators, some of whom had a tendency to try to correct ‘errors’ or remove ‘obviously made up’ things, like the unicorn (rhinoceros).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this can be quibbled with slightly. The Polo manuscript tradition is somewhat complicated and above my pay grade for the most part, but my understanding is that there are some manuscripts of the <em>Book of Wonders</em> which are generally regarded as having been amended by Polo during the 25 years that he lived as a free man – and an affluent one at that – after his release from Genoese captivity. And, quite apart from things like corrections, discrepancies across manuscripts accrued for a number of other reasons, as you note. With all that in mind, it seems pertinent to ask if the ‘serpent’ passage in question is consistent across manuscripts, and if not, then whether it can actually be understood in terms of embellishment, either one by Rusticello which was later excised by later associates of Polo, or one that emerged in later versions of the manuscript with greater distance from the original source.</p>

<p>With regards to Highlanders, the game is a little vague on whether its Highlanders represent Scottish irregulars of the 17th and 18th century like Montrose’s royalists or the Jacobites, or if they are more representative of the regular Highland regiments of the British Army which began being raised in 1739. The latter would absolutely use bayonets rather than swords, whereas the former were, as you would have observed, skirmished with muskets and closed with swords. Given that the Highlanders in game are mercenary troops I think you can make a strong case for the former, but I’d still caution against the idea that <em>all</em> Highlanders drew swords in melee.</p>

<p>On the purely My Immortal front, I know there’s a video that isn’t Sarah Z that goes into <em>I’m Not Okay</em> in some detail, but I forget what it is. More recently though, Strange Æons did a pair of videos on My Immortal, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JodBp-r9jM">one</a> where they argue that My Immortal probably isn’t a trollfic and was likely genuinely written by an American expatriate in Dubai, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WShlzUBlUXY">another</a> where they cover the later spurious authorship claims.</p>

<p>As for ‘video that keeps digging deeper’, I think Strange Æons’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y5HFjiBNk">Snapewives video</a> may also fit the bill. Folding Ideas/Dan Olson’s recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biYciU1uiUw">Contrepreneurs: The Mikkelsen Twins</a> is a similar though perhaps not as overt kind of descent down the rabbit hole. I also quite like Lady Emily’s video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwulEe3Tmz4">Family Dollar game show</a>. I’ll also take a second to bring up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MiaMulder">Mia Mulder</a>, who does some videos on gender, some on history, and a few on both! More specifically though, her videos often look at conspiracy theories about one or the other subject, which is invariably a rabbit-holey kind of thing. IMO her Tartaria video supersedes my own r/badhistory writeup from 3 years ago.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1007.4</strong> —–2022-12-28 15:23:55+08:00:</p>

<p>So this is something that is one part scuffle, one part ramble, and one part prompt, (and as it turns out longer than a single comment), but my big distraction today was thinking about the samurai skirmish wargame <em>Test of Honour</em>, which led down a load of rabbit holes, not all of which I have explored in full.</p>

<p>Before I can get into Test of Honour (henceforth ToH), it seems necessary to at least briefly describe its original publisher, Warlord Games. Warlord is one of the big names in wargaming, especially historical gaming, having been founded by ex-Games Workshop employees John Stallard and Paul Sawyer in 2007. Warlord later managed to scoop up Rick Priestley, the original author of <em>Warhammer Fantasy Battles</em> and <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, after he left Games Workshop in 2009; Priestley, who now co-owns the company, has since written several sets for Warlord including <em>Bolt Action</em>, <em>Black Powder</em>, and <em>Hail Caesar</em>, which are all pretty standard introductory rules for their respective periods. With a lot of historical games, it’s not particularly typical to have what I’ll call ‘vertically integrated’ systems where a single manufacturer produces rules and miniatures and you <em>have</em> to use particular miniatures with particular rules as, after all, you can’t copyright history the way you can a fictional IP. Now, every once in a while, Warlord does try to do that with a licensed range or comes up with an original IP: Rick Priestley’s <em>Beyond the Gates of Antares</em> for instance has been its major ‘in-house’ IP, but you can tell it’s been relegated to a somewhat secondary position based on the fact it doesn’t even have a top-level tab on Warlord’s store page anymore. But, as Warlord Games is primarily in the historicals market, its business model has to be rooted in the awareness that A) there are alternatives to their rules out there, and B) there are alternatives to their miniatures out there.</p>

<p>So, this leads us back to ToH. ToH, written primarily by Graham Davey, is a skirmish game set in Japan’s Sengoku period (roughly 1450-1620), and is intended for forces of around 10-20 figures, with ‘hero’ and ‘companion’ figures operating individually while ‘followers’ usually form squads of 3. While I have not had a chance to play these rules, I do have them, so as a quick summary: Activation is done through drawing tokens from a bag, with players alternating: drawing a hero or follower token allows you to activate one of the appropriate figures or groups of figures; drawing a Fate token leads to playing an event card that can have effects on gameplay. Most actions in the game involve doing a Test of [Skill] – these skills being Aim, Agility, Strength, Wits, and Honour. When a figure or unit takes a test, you roll the number of dice indicated under the appropriate skill listed on its stat card, using a game-specific dice set. These dice have, if I am not mistaken, one face with two swords, two faces with one sword, two blank faces, and one with an X. To pass a Test you need to get at least three swords <em>and</em> not have more crosses than swords. Combat entails a succession of such tests: the attacker makes a Test of Aim, the defender – if possible – makes a Test of Agility to see if they can dodge, the attacker then makes a Test of Strength to see if they inflict a fatal wound or a light one, and finally the defender – if a hero – can perform a Test of Honour to reduce a fatal wound to an Injury. A lot of this revolves around game-specific card decks for stats, events, Honour and Dishonour effects, and Injuries, so you do really need to buy the physical paraphernalia to get it working.</p>

<p>When ToH first came out in 2017, competition came from two fronts: rules and figures. On the rules front there were a few options, most prominently Craig Woodfield’s <em>Ronin</em>, published by Osprey Games in 2013 with a supporting range by North Star Figures, but essentially miniatures-agnostic; there was also <em>Torii</em>, released by Zenit Miniatures in 2016, again somewhat miniatures-agnostic but tied in with their existing fantasy-inspired <em>Kensei</em> setting; and there was <em>Daishō</em>, an independent set by Charles Murton and Craig Cartnell from 2017, to name the ones that spring to mind. On the figures front, the market for samurai minis was honestly pretty saturated: Perry Miniatures, North Star, The Assault Group, AW Miniatures, Zenit, Dixon, Kingsford, and Black Hat, to name just some of the ones I can dig up (by which I mean found on <a href="https://tinyhordes.com/28mm-samurai-miniatures-review/">Andy of Tiny Hordes</a>). Not all of them are very <em>good</em> mind you, but still, Perry in particular offered and still offers a mostly comprehensive range with good quality scuplts and <em>very</em> good relative value for money, and so Warlord would basically have to try to compete by offering niche and/or setting-specific figures.</p>

<p>On the rules front, ToH was pretty well-liked. A lot of the hobby news sites and blogs I found were positive about ToH, and generally liked the systems. That said, there were dissenters: some users of Lead Adventure Forum’s Adventures in the Far East, largely devotees of <em>Ronin</em> and <em>Daishō</em>, found it a bit clunky and in one case reached some kind of terrible equilibrium where units would advance to contact and then immediately ‘bounce’ off without fighting. But as said, the rules were not <em>dis</em>liked on the whole, and had the advantage of also being backed by, well, Warlord Games, arguably the next biggest wargaming company after GW, so seem to have had a decent amount of purchase after their mid-2017 release.</p>

<p>On the figures front, this got a little trickier. In 2016, Warlord Games all but acquired Wargames Factory, a manufacturer of multipart plastic miniatures based in the US. Wargames Factory is still technically an independent LLC, but Warlord has the exclusive rights to distribute Factory miniatures globally, so it is now functionally a Warlord imprint. Factory’s range included four sprues for feudal Japan: Ashigaru missile troops, Ashigaru spearmen, Samurai infantry and Samurai cavalry. The Factory minis are fine and definitely competitively priced, but the criticism they can be a bit ‘flat’ is not entirely unwarranted. These could be bought individually, or bundled in a discounted starter set for ToH with the rules, dice, and cards. But now, we can finally get to the background to the gripe that led me to this post: Warlord also produced some <em>new</em> minis for ToH, which we can divide into two types.</p>

<p>Type 1 are what I will term ‘bonus figure kits’: these are where there’s a sprue of Factory plastic minis bundled with a Warlord metal figure, which itself comes with a set of metal headswaps with which to convert those figures over. The <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ToH-masked-men-3.jpg">Masked Men</a> are the Ashigaru spearmen sprue with a warrior monk leader and with oni mask headswaps; the <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ToH-mounted-samurai-3.jpg">Samurai Cavalry</a> are the, er, Samurai cavalry sprue with a special masked commander and helmet-less head swaps; the <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ToH-pauper-soldiers-3.jpg">Pauper Soldiers</a> are the Ashigaru missile troops with a special kneeling hero and straw hat head swaps; the <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ToH-ronin-3.jpg">Ronin</a> are the Samurai infantry with a tetsubo-wielding hero and various helmet-less head swaps; <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ToH-chobei-1.jpg">Chobei’s Renegades</a> are part of an Ashigaru spearmen sprue and part of an Ashigaru missile troops sprue with a hero and… bare head swaps; and finally the <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ToH-daimyo-1.jpg">Daimyo’s Retinue</a> were Samurai cavalry again but with helmet swaps this time, while the Daimyo himself goes bareheaded.</p>

<p>Type 2 are what I will call ‘fully original sets’: entirely new, all-metal figures by Warlord. There were <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bandits-Minis.jpg">Bandits and Brigands</a>, the <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/769910008-Test-of-Honour-Dojo-assault-1.jpg">Dojo Assault Set</a> consisting of a swordmaster and 7 ninjas, <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/762210006-Onna-bugeisha-of-Asakura-01-600x600.jpg">Onna-Bugeisha (female samurai)</a> with two armoured naginata-wielders, three unarmoured archers, and two unarmoured melee fighters, and a <a href="https://tgneast.blob.core.windows.net/content/2018/11/post-241046/Seven-Ronin-Product-Image-1-600x600_medium.jpg">Seven Samurai</a> set.</p>

<p>But then, something happened. Why exactly, I am not sure, but in early 2019 Graham Davey split off from Warlord Games to form his own company, Grey For Now Games (henceforth GfN), taking <em>Test of Honour</em> with him. That year, the game would essentially get a relaunch, with a second edition of the rules that dealt with a lot of the issues people had with the first, a new line of minis commissioned directly by Grey for Now that could be used as starter or expansion forces, and collaborations with North Star Figures and Footsore Miniatures’ existing feudal Japan lines (North Star stocks GfN and Footsore figures and vice versa). But what of the Warlord Games figures? Well, aside from the Seven Samurai, which were stocked by GfN until they ran out, all the ToH-specific minis that Warlord had produced were discontinued. So, no more oni mask head swaps, no more bandit gangs, and critically, no more Onna-bugeisha.</p>

<p>Or was it? Because in December 2018, Warlord Games released Warlords of Erewhon, its new fantasy setting; this in turn got a samurai expansion in summer 2020 – as you do – which saw most of the old ToH exclusives re-released, and often with additional sculpts to form larger unit packs. There’s a new, enlarged <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/0949/4864/products/692215002_Erewhon-Bandits-_-Brigands1_800x.jpg?v=1626049769">Bandits pack</a>, the <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/0949/4864/products/693015003-Warlords-of-Erewhon-Ninjas2_800x.jpg?v=1575567058">Ninjas</a> are back but without new sculpts, most of the heroes have reappeared in a <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0309/8965/products/692415001-Warlords-of-Erehwon-Samerai-Heroes1.jpg?v=1632141317">heroes pack</a>. The mounted figures haven’t yet reappeared however, nor, as far as I am aware, the head swaps that came with the original run of expansion sets. More critically, while <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0309/8965/products/693015007_Warlord-of-Erehwon_Armoured-Onna-bugeisha-with-naginata1.jpg?v=1627314506">Armoured Onna-Bugeisha</a> are back, as are <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0309/8965/products/693015006-Warlords-of-Erewhon-Onnabugeisha-with-longbows1.jpg?v=1627313520">Onna-Bugeisha Archers</a>, there is as yet no sign of the two unarmoured Onna-Bugeisha from the original pack.</p>

<p>And this is where it affects <em>me</em> personally. Because I have, for a while, been attempting to put together a force that can be used as the Aizu Women’s Brigade (as depicted in – TW for blood – <a href="https://preview.redd.it/jv8ufjymh2x31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0087bf44bf83824dd0d3c35292dc49cffbfa1a55">this modern rendering</a>), which requires largely unarmoured figures. <em>Sharp Practice</em> would require 12 figures, <em>The Men Who Would Be Kings</em> 16; and while two figures still doesn’t cover all of that by any means, it would have been nice to have been able to have them for the sake of variety.</p>

<p>So I guess to also give something to respond to, a couple of ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are there interesting cases in your hobby of someone trying to make the New Big Thing that will outcompete all the alternatives on the market to become the New Standard, only to end up just creating a new competing standard amid all the existing ones?</li>
  <li>Are there interesting cases in your hobby of someone making a thing, then pulling it from circulation despite probably not losing money on it, in a way that has caused intense personal frustration, either as someone who had been using the thing or as someone who latterly discovered the thing that might be useful?</li>

<p>Terry Farrell has never officially declared why she quit, and while there is the explanation from the scheduling conflict, that in turn still requires explaining why she wanted to go from full time to part time unlike the rest of the cast. That is almost certainly to do with Rick Berman, but again, she has never officially said anything on the matter.</p>

<p>Separately, on the matter of showrunners it is worth distinguishing between the overall Trek showrunners (i.e. Berman and to an extent Brannon Braga) from the individual series showrunners, as DS9 was largely an Ira Steven Behr project after S2.</p>

<p><strong>From Jonathan Tepperman:</strong> “It has been a head-spinning season, even by the turbulent standards of contemporary China. But underneath the noise, the events all carried the same signal: that far from a rising behemoth, as it is often portrayed by the U.S. media and American leaders, China is teetering on the edge of a cliff. Ten years of President Xi Jinping’s “reforms”—widely characterized in the West as successful power plays—have made the country frail and brittle, exacerbating its underlying problems while giving rise to new ones. Although a growing number of Western analysts—including Michael Beckley, Jude Blanchette, Hal Brands, Robert Kaplan, Susan Shirk, and Fareed Zakaria—have begun to highlight this reality, many American commentators, and most politicians (ranging from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to President Joe Biden), still frame the U.S.-China contest in terms of Beijing’s ascent. And if they do acknowledge China’s mounting crises, they often cast them as either neutral or positive developments for the United States. But the opposite is true. Far from good news, a weak, stagnant, or collapsing China would be even more dangerous than a thriving one—not just for the country itself, but for the world.”</p>

<p><strong>From Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage:</strong> “War is inherently unpredictable. Indeed, the course of the conflict has served to invalidate widespread early prognostications that Ukraine would quickly fall; a reversal of fortunes is impossible to discount. It nevertheless appears that Russia is headed for defeat. Less certain is what form this defeat will take. Three basic scenarios exist, and each one would have different ramifications for policymakers in the West and Ukraine.  . . . The first and least likely scenario is that Russia will agree to its defeat by accepting a negotiated settlement on Ukraine’s terms.  . . . A second scenario for Russian defeat would involve failure amid escalation.  . . . The final scenario for the war’s end would be defeat through regime collapse, with the decisive battles taking place not in Ukraine but rather in the halls of the Kremlin or in the streets of Moscow.”</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-12-12~2022-12-18的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-18/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-12-12~2022-12-18的言论" /><published>2022-12-18T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-18/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-18/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>The quote you linked above is from Letters, Volume 1 at page 33 (English version).  Jung was writing to a potential patient, who sought to engage his services in overcoming her struggles to understand others.</p>

<p>The letter: https://carljungdepthpsychologysite.blog/2020/02/08/carl-jung-i-am-afraid-that-the-mere-fact-of-my-presence-takes-you-away-from-yourself/</p>

<p>I can’t even pretend to have the full context of their correspondence.  But based on Jung’s other writings I’ve read, Jung was saying the same thing the Oracle was telling Neo in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0rqoRbzzU&amp;ab_channel=williamtruglio">The Matrix</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Know thyself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jung wrote that dreams were the impartial, spontaneous products of our unconscious psyche that are outside the control of our will.  But there are so many different layers of meaning, navigating them is impossible without some point of reference to orient our understanding.</p>

<p>The idea is that by self understanding, we become the point reference through which we may orient our understanding of the external world.  In that way, we wake up.</p>

<p>As of the time this comment is posted, I do not see a satisfying explanation of what integrating the shadow actually means.  So I’ll do it.</p>

<p>Here is what integrating the shadow means, in plain English:</p>

<p>As Jung uses the term, an individual’s “shadow” represents his potential to cause harm (of any kind, including violence, reputational, deception or anything else).</p>

<p>An individual may recognize that he has an impulse to cause harm, but not act on it.  If that individual can’t act on his impulse because he is weak or cowardly, does that mean he is a <em>good</em> person simply because he has not caused harm to another?  Absolutely not, according to Jung.  In the best case, such an individual is childlike, infantile and meek (e.g., Frodo in the first part of the first Lord of the Rings book).  In the worst case, he is malicious and vindictive, yet cowardly (e.g., Bilbo Baggins or Dostoevsky’s Underground Man).  No matter which it is, that person has not integrated his shadow.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an individual may recognize that he has an impulse to cause harm, but does not act on it despite knowing that he absolutely could if he so chose.  If that individual chooses not to act, the choice is not because he lacked the option.  It is because he had the option and yet did not.  In this case, the choice to do what is right by others (or at least refrain from harming them) is done <em>because it is the right thing to do</em>, not for lack of the option to do otherwise.  This person has integrated his shadow (e.g., Frodo and arguably Sam, at the end of The Return of the King).</p>

<p>Integrating your shadow is not about “incorporating some parts of the evil about you,” as another commenter incorrectly stated.  It’s about coming to terms with the fact that you have the capability to inflict harm on others, and realizing that potential is a source of strength.</p>

<p>Specifically, integrating your shadow has nothing to do with “evil,” as such.  But the capacity to cause harm, such as the capacity to engage in violence.  Violence is not always evil.  Sometimes it is, but other times it is justified (such as in defense of another).</p>

<p>The person who has not integrated his shadow will fold over, in the face of evil, however.  The person with an integrated shadow, on the other hand, has the strength to contend with whatever evil he faces and contend with it in a “you do your worst, and I will do mine” sort of way.</p>

<p>Integrating the shadow is also different from being willing to confront evil.  Again, integrating the shadow is about having the capability to contend with evil, not act on the desire to confront it.  A willingness to confront evil is may require an integrated shadow as a prerequisite, but that alone is insufficient.  For example, compare Schindler (who shielded victims of the third reich’s evil, at great risk to his life while still endeavoring to protect his financial interests) with Dietrich Bonhoeffer or Claus von Stauffenberg (both of whom plotted to cut off the head at its source, i.e., kill Hitler, even if doing so meant it would cost their lives).</p>

<p>And integrating the shadow also has nothing to do with how similar or different anyone is to the average German person during the third reich.  Not even close to a relevant point.</p>]]></content><author><name>theoryofdoom</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2022-12-12~2022-12-18的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-18/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2022-12-12~2022-12-18的言论" /><published>2022-12-18T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-18/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-18/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>The ambiguity of the Ryukyu kingdom’s status is an interesting case to tackle because it does really take some getting into the diplomatic landscape (er, seascape?) of the region and period to properly contextualise. We need to set aside Westphalian ideas of exclusive sovereignty and approach post-1609 Ryukyuan statehood in terms of a negotiation between a variety of overlapping interests, which were in conflict in some cases but in concert in some others. What emerges out of that is an understanding that the narrative of continued Ryukyuan independence was not necessarily just a clever coverup: on the one hand, we can see it as a sort of mutually agreed fiction for mutual benefit; on the other, we can also see it as genuinely reflecting an ambiguous status on Ryukyu’s part, where it really wasn’t a clear-cut case of domination by ‘Japan’, however defined.</p>

<p>Firstly we need to give a little background on both the Chinese and Japanese sides of things. In Fairbank’s old ‘Chinese World Order’ model, ‘China’, however understood, served as a fount of political legitimacy for the states of East Asia. Tributary states engaged in ritual gift exchange and in a rhetoric of subordination in order to obtain legitimation through recognition by the Chinese emperor. What has emerged since among historians is a counter-argument that the reverse was usually equally, if not more true: Asian regional powers could do without recognition by a Chinese empire, whereas Chinese empires derived considerable legitimation of their own from being acknowledged as being at the nominal centre of the East Asian political order. To use a Ming-Qing example, recent work by Yuanchong Wang has argued that recognition by Joseon Korea was integral to the Qing Empire’s self-perception, as it both signified that the Qing had successfully assumed the Ming Empire’s place in the East Asian order, and also, on a deeper level, served as an exemplar of a superior-subordinate relationship in the Confucian hierarchical worldview, certifying the ‘Chineseness’ of the Qing state within the broader Sinosphere. The Ryukyus can be seen in similar terms: it was important to the Qing that the kingdom was <em>both</em> independent <em>and</em> recognised the Qing state as legitimate, or at least that it <em>appeared</em> so. Of course, the tribute trade also had economic value, through which could be exercised a degree of hard power leverage, but we ought not to take a  reductionist approach of presuming that <em>all</em> commerce was conducted through formal tribute arrangements as opposed to private enterprise.</p>

<p>On the Japanese side, we ought to bear in mind that Japan was not a unified state at this time, and indeed would not be until the latter half of the nineteenth century. Satsuma’s status as a ‘vassal’ of the Tokugawa <em>bakufu</em> based at Edo ought to be understood as being one that was not a clear-cut position of subordination. Indeed, many of what the <em>bakufu</em> termed <em>han</em> (‘domains’) saw themselves as <em>kuni</em> (‘countries’), independent states which conceded to a degree of Tokugawa interference. Satsuma formed an extra-special exception within the system, as, unlike basically all the other domains, it had the right to possess more than one castle, and so it maintained its own system of sub-fiefdoms. This autonomy was part of how it ended up able to sustain direct overlordship over the Ryukyu kingdom, such that it exercised its own layer of authority even as it fell within the broader jurisdiction of the Tokugawa <em>bakufu</em>. This did not mean, however, that Tokugawa rule was exercised exclusively through Satsuma: because the kingdom was a Satsuma vassal, it was <em>also</em> a Tokugawa vassal by extension, and the <em>bakufu</em> was able to exercise its own authority over it.</p>

<p>With that now discussed, let’s look at the aftermath of 1609: under the terms of the 1611 surrender agreement whereby the Ryukyu kingdom submitted to Satsuma suzerainty, Satsuma received regular tribute, gained veto power over Ryukyu’s trade policy, and it also required the kingdom to move towards appointing offices by merit rather than heredity. However, while the <em>bakufu</em> permitted Satsuma to receive tribute from the Ryukyu kingdom, it had also maintained that the Shō family of Chūzan would continue to occupy the throne. As a result, although Satsuma suzerainty eventually led to the erosion of the local nobility and Buddhist temples in favour of a new class of Confucian literati, it never managed to dethrone the royal house and establish the region as a direct province of Satsuma’s mini-empire. Officially, the Ryukyus’ agricultural output began to be listed as part of Satsuma’s land value assessment starting in 1634, but this didn’t inherently clear things up. You could, I think, make the argument that part of why Ryukyuan subjugation was never formally declared to the Ming or Qing was that there was a genuine ambiguity as to the relationship was between the kingdom, Satsuma, and the <em>bakufu</em>: was the Ryukyu Kingdom primarily a Tokugawa vassal, over whom Satsuma was granted administrative authority and entitlement to its revenues? Or was it fundamentally a Satsuma dominion, but one where the <em>bakufu</em> drew some red lines so that Satsuma didn’t overstep its authority more broadly? Maintaining this Schrödinger’s Cat state arguably suited all parties, as it allowed the royal line to stay in place, while neither Satsuma nor the <em>bakufu</em> had to risk conceding their part in the power-sharing arrangement depending on how the situation resolved.</p>

<p>Ryukyu would soon be confirmed in a considerable degree of autonomy even within its nominal subordination to its Japanese overlords. A 1624 memorandum from Satsuma stipulated, among other things, that ‘people from other <em>kuni</em>’ were forbidden from visiting the kingdom, which did not <em>necessarily</em> exclude those living in the Tokugawa’s personal fiefdoms, but which did make Satsuma the only vassal <em>han</em> allowed to send its subjects to Ryukyu. While this would affirm that Satsuma was the only domain allowed to exercise authority over the kingdom, the extent of that authority was also more formally delineated: Satsuma renounced any ability to interfere in cases of capital punishment or exile, and in the long run there was the implicit understanding that Ryukyuans who were convicted of crimes in <em>any</em> Satsuma-claimed territory would be tried in Ryukyuan courts, in a massive concession to Ryukyuan judicial autonomy.</p>

<p>As argued by Gregory Smits, this round of concessions in 1624 was the result of Satsuma feeling the need to preserve an image of Ryukyuan independence in order to siphon off its continued tribute trade with the Ming. Ryukyu had sent tribute missions to the Ming court once every two years since 1522, but this had been reduced to effectively once every ten years during the period of 1612-22, and the reason was pretty simple: the Ming were not unaware that there had been an invasion, and were attempting to use the cession of tribute as a form of economic leverage to weaken Satsuma control. By restoring measures of Ryukyuan sovereignty, Satsuma hoped that the Ming would again allow a more regular exchange, and this ultimately paid off – the Ming allowed one mission every five years from 1622, and after the 1632 mission the Ryukyu kingdom was again permitted to trade biennially.</p>

<p>What ensued was what Okinawan historian Mamoru Akamine terms the ‘policy of concealment’: a mutual concession between the Ryukyu Kingdom, the Ming/Qing, Satsuma, and the Tokugawa <em>bakufu</em> that allowed all parties to achieve some form of acceptable outcome, despite a common implicit recognition of Satsuma suzerainty over the islands. The Ryukyuan royal house maintained its status and judicial authority, the Ming/Qing were able to continue to cite the Ryukyus as an independent state that accepted their supremacy, Satsuma was able to maintain what authority it could over the islands as well as siphon off Ryukyuan tribute, and the <em>bakufu</em> avoided conflict with China. An extra bonus was that every formal Ryukyuan visit to Edo was followed up by promotions for the Shimazu <em>daimyo</em> of Satsuma, which created an incentive within the <em>bakufu-han</em> relationship for Satsuma to maintain its suzerainty over Ryukyu without antagonising its continental neigbour.</p>

<p>The full mechanisms of the ‘policy of concealment’ came to be hashed out after 1667, four years after the kingdom stopped recognising the Ming (whose last loyalist remnants formed a rump state on Taiwan) and began paying tribute to the Qing exclusively in 1663, although it appears that they had been sending missions to both as early as 1655 with <em>bakufu</em> sanction. Officially, the Ryukyuan kingdom was independent, but told the Qing that they had a commercial arrangement with Satsuma domain on the island of Takarajima, in the same way that Tsushima (a domain ruled by the Sō clan) served as an intermediary between Japan and the Joseon kingdom, or how Dejima served as the intermediary for trade with the Dutch outside Nagasaki. Interestingly, it was Ryukyu’s royal court which promulgated many of the regulations whereby the ‘policy of concealment’ was to be maintained: if a ship was wrecked off the Chinese coast, all Japanese-language documents were to be burned before the crew were rescued, as that would ensure their recognition as Ryukyuans and entitle them to shelter in Fuzhou, and from thence to repatriation. If Ryukyuan crew were part of a Satsuma ship that was wrecked, they would masquerade as Japanese in order to be sent back with the Satsuma crew. If Chinese envoys were present in Ryukyu to present investiture patents, any notion that the islands had a Japanese connection was to be suppressed: Japanese names, language, poetry, calendar, coinage, religious iconography, even Japanese-style tools were to be hidden away for the duration. The envoys were not allowed to leave the city limits of Naha, while Satsuma officials were temporarily relocated to a village outside the city.</p>

<p>—– <strong>980.2</strong> —–2022-12-18 17:05:45+08:00:</p>

<p>The only problem was that the concealment policy only worked so far: it seems to have successfully obfuscated the specific notion that the Ryukyu islands were under Japanese dominion, but it was patently obvious that there was <em>something</em> being hidden. On one occasion there was a slip up in which an envoy noticed a bell that bore a Japanese reign date, but assumed it must have been a Tang-era antique (conveniently, the Genna 元和 era of 1615-24 in Japan shared the characters for the Yuanhe 元和 era of 806-820 in the Tang); a later envoy who had read the proceedings of the previous missions brought this up during a meeting and correctly deduced that it must have been a Japanese object, as he knew that there had been no relations between the Ryukyu Islands and the Tang Empire. Yet nothing came of it. The key thing here was ritual and appearances: whether Ryukyu was ‘actually’ independent didn’t matter, as long as it could credibly <em>appear</em> as such, because from the Qing point of view, there was no inherent benefit to ensuring the kingdom’s independence and territorial integrity. If they didn’t ask for help, then they clearly didn’t need it – compare with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qlfr99/how_was_the_relationship_between_qing_china_and/hj6qjbg/?context=3">the Qing approach to Badakhshan in the late 1750s</a>, where the local ruler asked for help and the Qing envoys decided he was exaggerating the threat. All the Qing wanted was to ensure that a polity that seemed to be taking care of itself recognised Manchu rule as legitimate. And so, in this way, the Qing were able to accept that there had been some kind of disturbance involving the Japanese in the early part of the century, and some kind of ongoing Japanese connection with the islands, but one that really wasn’t worth worrying about.</p>

<p>That said, it would be remiss not to at least briefly discuss the rather complicated status of Ryukyu in the period of 1644-1683, after the fall of the original Ming state but before Qing rule was completely undisputed. This revolved especially around the affairs of the Zheng family, which had already been powerful regional strongmen in Fujian well before their conquest of Dutch Taiwan in 1662, and had some ties to Japan. Zheng Zhilong, its patriarch until his defection to the Qing in 1646 split the family between pro-Ming and pro-Qing camps, had been a privateer for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and had by extension built up a network of contacts on Kyushu, which included his primary wife, Tagawa Matsu. Tagawa’s eldest son, Zheng Chenggong, better known as Koxinga, took over most of the Zheng family’s assets after his father’s defection (though not without a period of struggle with a rival, Zheng Cai), and his agents, along with those of other Ming claimants in southern China, sought for some time to get Japan involved against the Manchus. These hopes were pretty optimistic: Tokugawa Iemitsu had considered dispatching troops in 1645 and 1646, but Zheng Zhilong’s defection to the Qing served to dissuade him from getting involved. After Koxinga and Zheng Cai failed to gain Japanese support directly via a mission to Japan in 1648, they attempted to use the Ryukyus as an intermediary the next year, to no avail.</p>

<p>As noted, Ryukyu would begin shifting its tribute missions to the Qing from 1655 onward, but did not formally cease recognition of some kind of Ming successor until 1663. This was not taken lightly by the newly-established Zheng kingdom on Taiwan (also known as the Kingdom of Dongning), which, amid deteriorating relations with the Tokugawa <em>bakufu</em>, attacked a Ryukyuan merchant vessel – plausibly their tribute ship – in 1670, seizing the cargo and massacring most of the crew. However, the three or four survivors who were imprisoned in Taiwan managed to make their way back to Okinawa some time later, so that in 1672 the <em>bakufu</em> finally caught wind of the attack and ordered officials in Nagasaki to seize three Taiwanese ships docked in Nagasaki until the payment of a 30,000 tael fine. Starting the next year, the <em>bakufu</em>’s annual instructions to the representatives of the VOC declared the Ryukyu Kingdom a <em>fuzoku no kuni</em> (‘attached country’) and its ships to be under constant Tokugawa protection, perhaps to pre-empt attacks by yet another maritime polity. For its part, the Zheng kingdom did not take things lying down, and essentially blockaded the Chinese coast in 1673 against any attempts to trade with Japan; while an envoy, Wu Peng, was sent to negotiate for the release of the seized cargoes and crews and did so successfully – to the point of receiving a 2000 tael gift – he was arrested on returning to Taiwan for having been too conciliatory.</p>

<p>Things rapidly changed in 1674, as the outbreak of the Three Feudatories revolt in southern China again directly embroiled the Zheng kingdom in the affairs of the Chinese mainland. Desperate to reopen commerce with Japan, a document <em>probably</em> authored by King Zheng Jing, but attributed to a minor official for plausible deniability, was presented. In it, the Zheng kingdom refused responsibility for the attack on the Ryukyuan vessel, citing the kingdom as a hostile state by virtue of its recognition by the Qing, and so by implication refused to recognise Japanese protection of Ryukyuan shipping – perhaps an indication that the ‘policy of concealment’ had worked on the Zheng kingdom as well. However, the document professed to good relations with Japan and returned Wu Peng’s gift, and it seems as though the non-apology was quietly accepted, such that Taiwanese trade with Japan resumed until the Zheng kingdom’s fall to the Qing in 1683. In the meantime, Ryukyu played both sides: during the feudatory revolt, it wrote paired tribute letters addressed to both the Ming <em>and</em> the Qing, and destroyed the inappropriate one depending on who controlled Fuzhou when the tribute ship arrived; on this basis, it again secured some status as a potential Ming recogniser and thus rendered its tribute ships safe from Zheng attacks.</p>

<p>A strange coda to this is the surprising paranoia that the <em>bakufu</em>, Satsuma, and the Ryukyu kingdom had about a potential Qing invasion of Japan. While none of these three states wanted to antagonise the Qing outright, neither were they eager to abase themselves before the ‘barbarian’ Manchus, but because of that it seems they were also convinced that a potential Manchu attack was imminent, whether over the Ryukyus or just as a punitive act. The beginning of tribute exchange with the Qing had been done at Tokugawa behest to forestall a potential attack by the Qing like what had happened with Korea in 1627 and 1636; during the Three Feudatories revolt, basically all decisions relating to Ryukyu’s foreign relations were passed up the chain by Satsuma for <em>bakufu</em> review, to ensure all parties were on the same page. When the Kangxi Emperor later commended Ryukyu’s apparently unwavering loyalty during the Feudatory uprising (having, it seems, never discovered the ruse with the dual letters), the relief was palpable: Shimazu Mitsuhisa, <em>daimyo</em> of Satsuma, ‘was barely able to contain his happiness’ in his correspondence with the Ryukyuan king, Shō Tei. And yet, despite the apparent success of the various obfuscatory policies, paranoia continued as late as the 1720s. <em>Bakufu</em> advisor Arai Hakuseki, prompted by concern over a possible Qing attack in connection with the Ryukyu Kingdom, researched Ryukyuan history extensively, publishing his findings in the <em>Ryūkyūkoku jiryaku</em> in 1711 and the <em>Nantōshi</em> in 1720. In 1712, Tokugawa officials contacted Satsuma officials, requesting that they compile information about the Qing military, especially armour and weapons. Satsuma forwarded this request through the Ryukyuan royal government, requesting that the next tribute mission specifically seek out books with information on Qing equipment. What became of this is unclear, but it suggests that as far as the Japanese authorities were concerned – both in Kagoshima and in Edo – the ‘policy of concealment’ had succeeded so far, but there was no guarantee it would do so forever.</p>

<p>To condense everything into a neat summary, the best way to put it is that the Qing knew something was up, but they were also aware that whatever it was wasn’t preventing Ryukyu from maintaining its tribute relationship, and if that was the case then the Qing weren’t interested in trying to find out what. While there was never a formal meeting between Qing and Japanese officials on this matter, the notion of a still-independent Ryukyu was essentially a mutually-constructed fiction in which the Qing quietly acquiesced to whatever chicanery the Ryukyuans were engaged in and chose not to rock the boat. Yet I would also note that there <em>was</em> a meaningful degree of continued Ryukyuan sovereignty, thanks to how the complex web of relationships panned out: the <em>bakufu</em>, wary of granting too much power to Satsuma, acted to prevent the islands’ complete subjugation, while the need to project the image of Ryukyuan independence towards China entailed genuine concessions towards maintaining at least some of the power of domestic royal institutions. Granted, there were notable domestic changes, particularly in the erosion of Buddhist institutions and the emergence of a much more Confucianised society, but this was not an explicitly intended dimension of Japanese policy: if anything, it was the result of a uniquely Ryukyuan negotiation between Satsuma’s demands for a meritocratic system of appointments on the one hand, and connections to the Qing intellectual world on the other. In the end, the Ryukyu Kingdom managed to sustain a certain degree of agency in its international relations, in such a way that its ambiguous status was not a failure of contemporary classification, but rather an accurate reflection of an intentional vagary that allowed all involved parties to negotiate between each other’s interests.</p>

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>That said, you’re probably looking for Jaxa, a state which Wikipedia alleges to have existed based on unlinked Polish sources from the 1970s and 1980s. There is some scholarship that confirms that Nikifor Chernigovsky briefly maintained a force of fugitives based in Albazin in the 1660s, but the notion that it was called ‘Jaxa’ seems to originate solely in the Polish scholarship on which the Wikipedia page is based. See Vincent Chen, <em>Sino-Russian Relations in the Seventeenth Century</em> (1966), and his source on Chernigovksy, Ernst Ravenstein’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Russians_on_the_Amur.html?id=1Qc6rwZ7g5gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;hl=en"><em>The Russians on the Amur</em> (1861)</a></p>

<h3 id="985-hobby-scuffles-week-of-december-19-2022-submitted-on-2022-12-18-2300170800">985: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/zp0i0t/hobby_scuffles_week_of_december_19_2022/">[Hobby Scuffles] Week of December 19, 2022</a>, submitted on 2022-12-18 23:00:17+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>985.1</strong> —–2022-12-19 09:09:48+08:00:</p>

<p>So, while this was mentioned briefly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/zp0i0t/hobby_scuffles_week_of_december_19_2022/j0qmzf2/">further up the thread</a>, I don’t think the short-lived controversy involving hyperpop producer umru was really properly elaborated on, because it was A Little More Complicated Than That.</p>

<p>Based on the general sort of timeline of events we have, umru was approached by Universal Music Japan (Mori Calliope’s label) to compose a track, which ultimately went on the song ‘Death Sentence’. The album released on 16 December (well, sort of 15 December, but it was 16 December in Japan!) and umru promoted their track… and then posted the following somewhat cryptic tweet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/GsQFmOz.png">hey everyone, I’m sorry about the mori calliope song - I was asked for instrumentals by universal japan and didn’t look into the artist or know about what she said. I won’t promote it further and I’ll do better at fully researching the artists I work for in the future.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this was a <em>fascinating</em> Tweet to drop with zero further context, because it wasn’t just vaguely accusing Mori of doing… something, it was also implicitly accusing Universal Music of being complicit. But what was the something in question? Nobody at this time actually knew for certain, but there was one major – and ultimately affirmed – speculation, which is that it had to do with things she had done on her indie persona, &gt;!Demondice!&lt;, back in 2014 (when she was 17, by the by). More specifically it was probably one or both of two things: a tendency to not-infrequently use the n-word (albeit in 3- and 5-letter variants and never hard-r) on Twitter, and a deeply insensitive song &gt;!called ‘Snake Eyez’!&lt;. Now, as the even older thread (linked in the linked thread) noted, while she has never explicitly apologised for either of these, she has since deleted both, such that the only remnants of either are through archived screencaps and downloads. What you attribute for this distancing (genuinely apologetic, pure embarrassment, public image) is up to you to speculate on, but what is clear is she has done what she can to publicly distance herself from it without explicitly acknowledging it. But you know who hasn’t forgotten? 4chan.</p>

<p>It is probably no exaggeration to say that 4chan and its related facets on other social media have lain at the heart of most of the Mori hatedom, and it seems pretty likely that it was people in that extended hatedom who were ‘tipping off’ umru. Indeed, as it turns out that is <em>exactly</em> what seems to have happened: after umru privated their Twitter they then <a href="https://twitter.com/lumiscera/status/1603955449350557697">tweeted out some of the 2014 screencaps</a>, which it would not have been possible for them to take themselves. Now, obviously the person making the Tweets being a literal teenager is not an ironclad defence. What a shame for umru, who in 2016 (at the age of 17, funnily enough) once publicly referred to someone as a <a href="https://twitter.com/kadzvb/status/1603637878105726976">‘japanese looking ass’</a>, as some users were quick to point out.</p>

<p>All that being said, umru is fully within their rights to rescind any promotion for or association with Mori Calliope for any reason. But it’s pretty clear that that reason is that someone showed them screencaps of deleted tweets from 2014, which again, can be a legitimate reason for cutting association, but hardly counts as ‘full research’. Indeed, ‘full research’ would probably show that this is what the Mori hatedom does every time she has a new release, and that maybe trusting 4chan should probably not be your first instinct. What’s more bewildering is that umru decided to immediately throw everyone under the bus on Twitter rather than trying to reach out to either the label or the creator, which you’d think might be a useful clarifying step to take beforehand.</p>

<p>As for the album? I liked it on the whole, but not all of the songs, and I didn’t think it played to her strengths, but it’s not something I’m too worked up about. YMMV.</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.2</strong> —–2022-12-19 09:30:19+08:00:</p>

<p>Ooh a hard pick, but I think ‘Resting Power’ off <em>UnAlive</em> is an underrated highlight from that album.</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.3</strong> —–2022-12-19 09:45:54+08:00:</p>

<p>The only way that it became general knowledge is because 4chan had been holding onto it, and arguably 4chan – or more accurately its broader ecosystem – is about the only group that <em>cares</em> enough to keep banging on about it. That’s not to say there isn’t a segment of 4chan that is pro-Calli, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t active hatedoms, though perhaps related more to the &gt;!Demondice!&lt; side of things.</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.4</strong> —–2022-12-20 10:53:20+08:00:</p>

<p>Tweets and an album that they had since retracted anyway? Written at the same age when umru had, themselves, posted weird racist stuff on Twitter?</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.5</strong> —–2022-12-20 13:32:34+08:00:</p>

<p>The thing about the screencaps is that they are old, because the tweets in question have been deleted. The people who created and archived those screenshots, and who began deploying them publicly, were originally people in 4chan who had sussed out Mori Calliope’s past identity, and were aware of the prospect of reputational damage through releasing them. I will grant that by this stage, it was probably not <em>exclusively</em> 4channers sharing these screenshots, but it absolutely fits into an existing pattern, and one that absolutely helps their agenda by virtue of being able to mask their standard brand of behaviour behind people with more genuine reasons for indignation.</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.6</strong> —–2022-12-20 14:04:12+08:00:</p>

<p>Not to suddenly turn into an Agatha Christie character, but there is an underlying question of <em>motive</em>. There are, I will grant again, two possible sorts of people who might have sent these screenshots to umru: a) people who genuinely care about racism and sincerely believe that Mori Calliope, or more specifically the actor behind her, is problematic or even outright racist; and b) people who do not care about racism in itself but seek to be inflammatory and stir up trouble. Those in the former category may be unaware that she has walked those back, or not accept what action she has taken as sufficient; by contrast, it is in the interests of those in the latter category to avoid mentioning that there might be something construed as a retraction. But I would expect a good faith actor to be likely to say ‘she has issued non-apologies’ rather than simply present the information without that further context.</p>

<p>So, sure – I can’t say with certainty whether it was good faith actors or bad faith actors who shared the stuff with umru. But I can say that based on what umru was willing to publicise, he can only be known to have received the screencaps without the context of ‘she has walked this back’, and I would attribute that to bad faith action.</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.7</strong> —–2022-12-20 20:38:08+08:00:</p>

<p>Before getting into the rest of this, I ought to clarify that she has addressed the controversy, but not through explicit, direct reference, nor has she issued an <em>apology</em> as such, as opposed to stating that there were dumb statements she made as an edgy teen that she disavows and no longer stands by. For <em>some</em>, that is either as good as an apology or about as close as one can reasonably expect, for others that is insufficient. But one would imagine a good-faith critic to bring up the apparent non-apologies, which are very much publicly visible, because a bad-faith critic would not potentially compromise their case by divulging the existence of this sort of grey-zone statement that might be taken as sufficient by the person they’re trying to convince otherwise. Again, umru not revealing whether they are aware of these later statements is not evidence that they are definitely not aware, but I would argue it is a reasonable inference that they were being presented the older screencaps without the context of the later retractions.</p>

<p>Back to the 4chan point, a big part of this is a context thing: it can be hard to impress on someone not in the VTuber space just how much of an influence 4chan has on the wider VTuber fandom ecosystem. A not insubstantial portion of VTuber Twitter revolves around accounts that directly engage with content from 4chan; 4chan-originated VTuber memes suffuse the wider space. Even Reddit isn’t immune: shitposting subreddit okbuddyhololive (aka okbh) has served a similar function in acting as a mediating zone between 4chan’s /vt/ board and and more mainstream subreddits like VirtualYoutubers and even the official Hololive sub. In effect, there is a chunk of VTuber Twitter that functions as a facet of a space that revolves around shock content in all its guises.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, pretty clear evidence to suggest the existence of an antidom that is explicitly uninterested in any sort of artistic critique of the work in question when it comes to Calli’s creative output or that of her offstream persona. Take for example the QRTs of <a href="https://twitter.com/zutomayo/status/1603344772462039041/retweets/with_comments">a recent ZUTOMAYO song she was featured on</a>. A sizeable chunk of those are not substantive critiques, it’s a performative, almost ritualistic statements to the effect of ‘Calli is a bad artist and a bad person [and ZUTOMAYO made a mistake working with her].’ I just don’t know quite how much more I can labour the point that there is a large community of people who pull the same shit every time Calli releases anything, or if anyone releases something she contributed to.</p>

<p>So you’re right. All we have is evidence that there are people who have made it a habit to smear Calli at every opportunity, that the original impetus for it existed on 4chan, and that umru had access to the screencaps. We don’t have a smoking gun that proves that umru got those screencaps from the smearers or that the specific people, smearers or not, were 4chan based. But in an environment where the only evidence we <em>can</em> have is circumstantial unless umru publicises their DM chatlogs, this is as close to a causal chain as we get, and one that is consistent with broader patterns in VTuber community drama.</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.8</strong> —–2022-12-21 08:19:43+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The album hasn’t been retracted it just came out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry for the confusing language, but I meant the 2014 EP that might have been alluded to. Umru made no indication that it was any of the content on the 2022 album that led to their disassociation. On the other point, umru calling someone out for allegedly unaddressed racism online isn’t invalidated by their own post, but it does create a certain hypocrisy given that arguably she has done more to address her own tweets (i.e. deleting them and indirectly disavowing them) than he has.</p>

<p>—– <strong>985.9</strong> —–2022-12-25 09:50:58+08:00:</p>

<p>As someone whose Mandarin is very rusty but who speaks Cantonese natively, I feel like it works better for the latter than the former, and so I half-wonder if Nintendo HK’s particular localisation was intended for a narrowly local market.</p>

<p>Of course then you have Pokemon, which has historically locally been 寵物小精靈 <em>cung mat siu zing ling</em> (literally ‘little pet spirits’) but where the ‘official’ localisation used by Nintendo is the solely phonetic 寶可夢 <em>bou ho mung</em> (presumably it’s using the Mandarin pronunciation, <em>bao ke meng</em>).

<p>大概率有两个结果：</p>

<p>1.刺激政策失败，没达到目的，基层不至于崩到底，但是政府财政压力会大幅度被加速，毕竟政府能赚多少钱是有数的，花钱没上限就算无限借新还旧，利息也要给，到后面如果市场反应过来就更麻烦了。</p>

<p>2.刺激成功，短期回光返照，但是带来经济过热，少数产业里大量资金涌入导致局部泡沫，然后该爆的爆，因为核心还是在于内需，劳动收入分配与劳工权益不能得到改善，短期刺激政策效益不大。</p>

<p>想想下一轮如果又是几万亿的刺激，管一两年用，给各个中小企稍微输血，相当于饿了几天的鱼，你湖里一抛饵，水面就跟烧开了似劈里啪啦，全都过来抢。</p>

<p>行政上，如果还是“任人唯亲”，有背景的吃肉，没背景的味都不许闻，钱砸下去跟没砸一样，债上去了，还是要政府还利息，内需上不去，中小企无法成为扩张生产、刺激通胀和消费、提供就业的稳定锚基本就是拖多久的问题，而中共基本盘不是这些中小企，相反这些中小企一直是被提防的对象。</p>

<p>后脚跟想都知道现在需要的是对内进行增长分派改革，国内分配利益的形式已经趋于固化，甚至可以说是死板，经济增长10%，中小企和广大劳动人口拿到手的非常稀少又有什么用，社会的经济形态已经在演化到下个阶段的门槛上了，中共却还在拿二十年前那套思维去办事。</p>

<p>刺激经济砸钱多了没收住的话，他们就差不多可以准备退出历史舞台了，地方现在这个尿性，大部分根本不可能还得起利息，羊毛出在羊身上，失业潮和经济下滑期间，买房子保土地财政就没钱消费，内需就持续崩下去，大量人口失业，有钱消费就不会去买房子，政府的土地财政崩盘，政府预备好停止运转。</p>

<p>其实白纸社运发生的时间点非常好，早点晚点都不合适。</p>

<p>目前可以判断封控政策哪怕没大规模感染和社运，也迟早因为财政压力在半年左右结束。</p>

<p>但是社运提前发生在他们公开承认打算放开前，同时感染还在攀升，这样政治上就避开了因为社运导致放开的这个锅，矛头就不会被轻易利用来攻击社运，同时还跟二十大习近平连任的敏感时间点挂钩，喊出了让他下台的口号，过度公开化等于摆上台。</p>

<p>在大多数人知晓白纸社运后，又看到了发生社运后，封控清零被强制快速转向，粉红就产生一个自我矛盾，包括他们在内都知道中国能决定转向的只有一拨人，那反过来讲，就形成一个问题。</p>

<p><strong>如果不承认社运有效，等于承认突然不顾一切放开，黑锅是中共的。</strong></p>

<p><strong>如果承认社运有影响力，等于民间地区有广大不满，无法被推到境外势力上，说明人民群众才应该是社会主体，因为中共政府怎么可能听境外势力的？逻辑无法自洽。</strong>（虽然还是境外势力的说辞推脱，但说出来有多少人真的信？很多粉红为主的国内社区都不怎么理睬这个话题，不愿意碰钉子，甚至有内讧）</p>

<p>因为把白纸社运与香港社运到六四一系列的挂钩，所以否定一个，就必须全部否定，这种思维从中共到粉红是一样的。</p>

<p>粉红钥匙搞不清里面的政治立场和矛盾问题，脑抽把白纸革命摆上台面，还在说人民群众，那就等于公开承认有声音要求中共下台，因为白纸革命的核心议题就是借疫情的问题，直接让中共下台，习近平下台。</p>

<p>所以到最后，墙内在不考虑财政问题后的主流议论，就变成要么承认社运有效，要么承认中共实在过于拉跨，恰巧就是因为中共和社运的绝对对立的，白纸社运喊出了中共下台口号，才没有任何缓冲余地，所以有时候适当的扩大尺度，收益可能远超想象。</p>

<p>否则很可能变成因为社运抗议的原因，中共被迫放开，然后导致大规模感染这种论调（现在也有，但不是主流，也不可能有说服力，因为中共自己不操盘没法扭转，而显然中共不愿意现在把这件事摆到台面承认反对声音比预期大）</p>

<p>可以说，十一月末的社运，在一个绝佳的时间点，刚好打蛇打七寸，一箭三雕，堵嘴效果比中共禁言都管用，要么摆上台公开谈让中共下台的反对声音客观存在，要么装死不承认，复读机是国家下大棋，然后看大规模感染后的医疗挤兑默默承受人口减员。</p>

<p>回形针几年前我跟他们说你们这样搞迟早要出事的，我不清楚他们是太刚了还是没当回事。</p>

<p>我记得有一期做BT传输科普，那个视频看文案台词都能感觉话里话外有意思，但是因为国内政治敏感的话题，没被炒起来前，评论区里留言的人很多都不一定会把视频内容联想到哪，所以也没人注意到，结果最后还是因为其他事，被抓辫子了。</p>

<p>国内那个环境我感觉他们不是不清楚，但具体想怎么面对也许没搞明白，他们这一系我记得是大象公会的圈子吧？不止是回形针，是他们这一系的人全都被同时期针对，可能不单纯是赛雷碰瓷，官方有人通过共青团，或者共青团内部想打击这一圈的人。</p>

<p>从一九年开始香港社运，就能看到有一批二三十岁的中共共青团成员，在互联网前线跟这些能利用和影响的UP在互动，需要时就串联在一起打击其他人，不过不清楚回形针的具体情况，但B站做的估计都要受他们节制，就是不知道触及的领域多大，肯定有人是不买账的。</p>

<p>猎巫就是收紧一些公共知识领域的话语权，像官方宣传时说的，要占领互联网舆论高地，直接堵嘴显然是没法给交代的，就批倒批烂再封，赛雷这样年轻的，做事不给自己退路，迟早要还的。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ForeignAffairsMag在2022-12-12~2022-12-18的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-16/ForeignAffairsMag/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ForeignAffairsMag在2022-12-12~2022-12-18的言论" /><published>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-16/ForeignAffairsMag</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-16/ForeignAffairsMag/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p><strong>[Summary of the current article] From Graeme Smith and Delaney Simon:</strong> The Taliban’s insistence on rolling out more restrictions on women and limiting other fundamental rights and freedoms has sparked an understandable backlash. Some Western officials are increasingly unwilling to countenance the kind of engagement that helped deliver lifesaving assistance in the past year. They want to block development aid, tighten sanctions, and isolate Afghanistan further. Such punitive measures would only hurt the population without changing the Taliban’s stance. No matter how unpleasant the regime in Kabul—and the Taliban’s behavior certainly deserves condemnation—donors should take further steps to stabilize the Afghan economy. To avoid disaster, Western governments must grit their teeth and stop constraining Afghanistan’s chances for development.</p>

<p><strong>From Liana Fix and Thorsten Benner:</strong> As the war in Ukraine rages on, few German politicians would take issue with the assertion that Berlin must reduce its energy dependence on Moscow. In fact, the German government has done so. And rhetorically, at least, German leaders are promising to ease the country’s economic dependence on China, as well. . . . So far, however, Scholz has been reluctant to upset the status quo with Beijing—not least because Russia’s war and high energy prices have taken a toll on the German economy. Large German companies that are heavily dependent on China’s market are keen to expand their operations instead of cutting back. But because its economic ties to China are so deep and complex—far more so than is the case with Russia—Berlin must move forcefully to reduce dependence on Beijing. In particular, the risk of a war over Taiwan leaves Germany dangerously exposed to economic coercion and shocks. This coming February, the German government will publish its first-ever national security strategy. Just ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this is Berlin’s chance to demonstrate that it has drawn the right lessons from the catastrophic failure of its past approach toward Russia. It is time for Germany to lay out a plan to reduce dependence on China by diversifying trade and investment ties and selectively decoupling from China on critical technologies.</p>

<p><strong>From Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid:</strong> Henry Kissinger insisted that the great dilemma of leadership is that we have to make decisions about the future without knowing what the outcome will be. This dilemma has become very acute in recent years, because the modern nation-state is a static point within an ever-expanding network of other powerful actors. Counterintuitively, the best way to handle this new world is not to work in a less compartmentalized manner but rather a more compartmentalized one. Stop looking at countries as whole units, and instead work with them on the basis of shared challenges and shared interests. This is the essence of the Connectivity Statecraft approach, and this is the direction in which global foreign policy needs to move.</p>

<p><strong>From Mick Ryan:</strong> “There are plenty of reasons to think that Kyiv can defeat even a revitalized Russian military. Ukraine’s international influence campaigns have been a model for other democracies to study and emulate. The Ukrainians have proven superior to the Russians at adapting and updating their tactics and military institutions. And they have far better morale. War holds no certainties, regardless of previous victories. But if Ukraine can maintain Western support, it can prove that Putin’s new theory of victory is just as misguided as was his last.”</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2022-12-05~2022-12-11的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-11/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2022-12-05~2022-12-11的言论" /><published>2022-12-11T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-11T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-11/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-11/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>962.1</strong> —–2022-12-07 11:06:53+08:00:</p>

<p>Before getting into the meat of the question (which, unfortunately, is basically scraps on the bone rather than a nice juicy steak), it seems pertinent to do a bit of historiographical discussion, not least because I have actually met and spoken with Allen Fung about his article and so can give a bit of extra context.</p>

<p>I don’t know who Esposito is citing, but I would hazard a guess that it might be S.C.M. Paine’s 2002 book on the First Sino-Japanese War, or he is otherwise drawing on similar sources, as Paine’s assessment of the Qing army is similarly unflattering. To give a few block quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A foreign observer described the Chinese troops being sent to Korea: “In front marched their leader with fixed bayonet and a very conscious sense of his own importance. Next came a heavily laden Pekingese small cart, going faster than I ever succeeded in getting a carter to drive me; on the back of this there were slung, without any protection whatever, perhaps three dozen mud-bespattered and rusty old-fashioned rifles. This cart was followed by an open farmer’s wagon laden with cases and kegs of gunpowder, atop of which perched a new-enlisted rustic complacently nursing his water-pipe. These are fair specimens of the ‘brave’ procession.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1894 Lord Curzon wrote, “Of discipline in the highest sense the Chinese have none; and no arms in the world…placed in untrained hands, can make them follow leaders who are nincompoops, or resist an enemy whose tactics…they do not understand. They have no idea of marching or skirmishing, or of bayonet or musketry practice. The only recruiting test is the lifting to the full stretch of the arms above the head of an iron bar, from the ends of which are hung two stones, weighing 9 1/2 stone the pair. Their drill is a sort of gymnastic performance, and their ordinary weapons are tufted lances, spears, battle-axes, tridents, and bows and arrows, with an ample accompaniment of banners and gongs. Rifles of obsolete pattern, bought second-hand or third-hand in Europe, are dealt out to those who are on active service. These and their ammunition are mostly worthless from age. The weapon of the majority is, however, an ancient matchlock, of which the most familiar pattern is the jingal, which requires two men to fire it. All these draw backs or delinquencies, however, shrink into nothingness when compared with the crowning handicap of the native officer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the Intelligence Division of the British Government, despite the importation of huge quantities of firearms, “the majority of the Chinese army is to this day armed with the now almost prehistoric matchlock.” The Japanese general staff estimated that only three-fifths of the Chinese army was armed with some kind of rifle. The rest had only a pike, spear, or sword.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paine attributes the continued prevalence of cold arms and especially of archery to the Qing preservation of the ‘Manchu Way’, but I’m not convinced entirely: she comments that most archers were Banner troops, which is reasonable, but it makes the discussion irrelevant to the First Sino-Japanese War, which was primarily fought by Han troops of the Huai Army. And it is to the Huai Army that we really need to turn specifically.</p>

<p>Before we do, though, we need to square the above pessimism with the more flattering portrait in Fung’s article, and here’s where a bit of context helps explain it: for one, the article in question is an updated undergraduate thesis, so we ought not to expect extreme rigour, but more importantly, it was written in the mid-90s, during the early rumblings of what would become the Chinese ‘economic miracle’, at a time when there was some degree of reassessment of Self-Strengthening as a point of comparison. Would modern China be able to sustain an economic modernisation effort, or would the results be similarly ephemeral? Fung was aiming to demonstrate that despite the failure against Japan, Self-Strengthening had been in large part successful in its originally intended aims, but that there were still a few deficiencies; the unspoken implication was that contemporary China’s resurgence similarly had the potential to be a sustained one. Whether he would still be making this argument now is another matter, but the main thing is that the situation at the time encouraged a more optimistic portrait of Qing military capabilities.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can’t say I necessarily have the primary source base to really go ahead and radically reassess things, but I will give offer a somewhat conjectural suggestion that would reconcile these two extreme positions. The Huai Army which marched into Korea was, in short, a highly variegated force, with a core of highly modernised, rifle-armed troops augmented by a force of poorly-equipped levies. In peacetime, the Huai Army, which was effectively a paramilitary force under Li Hongzhang rather than a direct component of the Qing military, would have been as well equipped as its officers could afford, but an emergency call-up in wartime would lead to poorer-equipped troops being brought in to swell the ranks. Hence the early battles, in which the cream of the Huai Army fought, would have seen Qing forces armed predominantly with rifles, whereas following losses at Pyongyang the Qing would be falling back on an ever-increasing proportion of second-line formations with much poorer standards.</p>

<p>In effect, we cannot speak of a singular ‘Qing army’ as such by this period. The Banners, the Green Standards, and the private militia armies constituted distinct and self-contained military organisations that were obviously not hermetically sealed, but which were nevertheless under distinct administrations, with distinct budgets. And even then there would be internal variation: metropolitan Banner units would generally be better equipped than provincial ones; the same militia army might have wildly varying standards from one unit to the next. With that in mind, the relatively uneven nature of Qing equipment is really not a huge surprise, and neither is the highly varied reporting on the subject.</p>

<p>Romulus Hillsborough is unfortunately an apologist for 20th century Japanese militarism and his scholarship is highly variable in quality, from very bad to aggressively average – his older work is heavily sourced from Japanese historical novels rather than contemporary sources. Until Nyri Bakkalian’s PhD thesis was unembargoed recently there was no good single narrative history of the Boshin War in English (if you can read Japanese there is an 1800-page epic by Ōyama Kashiwa), and even then Bakkalian is understandably concentrated on the war’s second phase involving the Northern Alliance, but there’s some good options for the broader Bakumatsu and Meiji Restoration periods which piece together into a pretty comprehensive overview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conrad Totman, <em>The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu, 1862-68</em> (1980)</li>
  <li>Albert Craig, <em>Choshu in the Meiji Restoration</em> (1961)</li>
  <li>Marius Jansen, <em>Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration</em> (1961)</li>
  <li>Mark Ravina, <em>The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori</em> (2004)</li>
  <li>Nyri Bakkalian, <a href="http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/32140/1/The%20Sparrow%27s%20Dream-%20ETD%20Format.pdf"><em>The Sparrow’s Dream: The Meiji Revolution and Local Self-Assertion in Northern Japan</em></a> (PhD Thesis, 2017)</li>
  <li>See also Bakkalian’s master’s thesis, <a href="http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7170/8/NABMAThesis_updated%20%281%29.pdf"><em>Lone Star of the North: The Northern Alliance Revisited</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The above five cover five different regional perspectives on the period, with Totman focussing on the Tokugawa Shogunate, Craig on Chōshū (the primary ‘restorationist’ domain), Jansen on Tosa (a latter ally of Chōshū), Ravina on Satsuma (which flipped from opposing to allying with Chōshū over the course of the 1860s), and Bakkalian on the domains of northern Japan which coalesced into the anti-restorationist Northern Alliance in 1868.</p>

<p>Some other recommendations I have seen but not pursued myself are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>M. William Steele, <em>Alternative Narratives in Modern Japanese History</em> (2003)</li>
  <li>Mark Ravina, <em>To Stand with the Nations of the World: Japan’s Meiji Restoration in World History</em> (2018)</li>
  <li>Michael Wert, <em>Meiji Restoration Losers: Memory and Tokugawa Supporters in Modern Japan</em> (2013)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the Ravina book above places significant emphasis on the Ezo ‘Republic’ and the issues with its characterisation as such. You may also find some chapters in the edited volume <em>The Meiji Restoration: Japan as a Global Nation</em> to be of interest.</p>

<p>R5: Not entirely sure what’s going on, but despite high legitimacy I’ve somehow got a -1.5m loyalists per month issue despite high legitimacy. I threw in the Armed Forces and reversed the loss while remaining in that high legitimacy bracket, but I have no idea what caused the loss during the Unions+Rural Folk only phase.</p>

<p>—– <strong>964.2</strong> —–2022-12-08 07:07:57+08:00:</p>

<p>I did not; having done that, the issue did persist.</p>

<p>—– <strong>964.3</strong> —–2022-12-08 07:26:47+08:00:</p>

<p>So, I did do that and added in the Armed Forces, which kept me at Legitimate and <em>initially</em> gave me +220k per month, but then after I reloaded the save where I did that, I was back at -1.5m per month. The only solution I found was to just not be at Legitimate anymore, by dropping one of the two IG I already had.</p>

<p>To clarify, the Legitimacy drop indicated was a <em>monthly</em> drop, not a one-off from removing IGs outside election season.</p>

<p>—– <strong>964.4</strong> —–2022-12-08 08:40:32+08:00:</p>

<p>Cheers. It was <em>very</em> distressing when I went from having roughly even radicals and loyalists to suddenly losing 1.5m a month!</p>

<p>This is probably not the answer you’re after, especially as someone who has only encountered the latter via reviews, but to put it a certain way, both are quite old books. <em>Search for Modern China</em> was first written in 1990 and its latest edition came out in 2012, so it’s not necessarily the most up-to-date survey. <em>Making China Modern</em> is much more recent, being from 2019, but it hews to a very traditionalist, Sinocentric historiography while essentially glossing over decades of revisionist Qing scholarship and its implications for post-Qing history. <a href="https://jimmillward.medium.com/we-need-a-new-approach-to-teaching-modern-chinese-history-we-have-lazily-repeated-false-d24983bd7ef2">James Millward’s review of the latter</a> is, I think, well worth reading.</p>

<p>—– <strong>966.2</strong> —–2022-12-09 23:06:02+08:00:</p>

<p>Arguably there isn’t really a good survey as such – any book that covers ‘modern China’ without recognising the modernness of that construct falls into the trap of treating the Ming-Qing-ROC-PRC as a continuous entity, where bits and pieces matter only if they fall within their varying imperial scopes. In my view about the best work from a historiographical and theoretical perspective is Pamela Crossley’s <em>The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800</em>, but Crossley’s infamously abstruse writing style is sometimes on full display in this one. If you’re prepared to work through some occasionally dense prose and a certain lack of explicit narrative signposting, that’s probably the best choice.</p>

<p>—– <strong>966.3</strong> —–2022-12-10 03:25:16+08:00:</p>

<p>The problem is that the contextualising information is going to tell you that the 700 pages you’ve read may have some good facts in them, but that they are arranged in a way that essentially makes those 700 pages <em>severely</em> misleading. But are you going to remember the nice neat 700-page narrative better, or the disconnected set of accessible blog posts covering individual bits and pieces? If you <em>do</em> insist on a primer, <em>Making China Modern</em> is not the worst, but I do <em>urge</em> you to at least also read <em>The Wobbling Pivot</em> alongside.</p>

<p>In regards to the Venetian beads, apparently it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rtjx83/some_historians_suggest_that_the_chinese_mayve/hqwpmrl/?context=999">may be more complicated than that</a>. There is a broadly plausible alternative carbon dating putting the beads in the 17th century, and moreover bead specialists have argued that these are actually pieces from 17th century Rouen, not 15th century Venice. So the jury seems to be out on whether these are pre- or post-Columbian finds.</p>

<p>你给礼物 would be ‘you give a present’ in the imperative form, which is probably not what you want! My recommendation would be 给你的礼物, which in literal terms would be ‘a present that is given to you’, but I’m not sure how idiomatic that is in Mandarin (my primary Sinitic language is Cantonese).</p>

<p>Admittedly it does put the focus a bit on Nietzsche specifically, but seeing as you also seem to have a specific interest, I assumed you might be amenable to that framing.</p>

<p>Generally no. I believe that the Great Wall has some lower ports in the parapet that might be used to drop small (<em>very</em> small) bombs, but examples such as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/YiFeng_Gate_Nanjing.jpg">this part of the Nanjing walls</a> show pretty clearly that while there are some ports that might be used for small arms, there’s nothing for directly threatening the base of the wall.</p>

<p>—– <strong>972.1</strong> —–2022-12-12 08:31:43+08:00:</p>

<p>The circumstances of the negotiation of the Treaty of Nerchinsk are fascinating, and the fact that the primary language was indeed Latin is worth exploring. Now, there is an answer here by /u/SalTez, but I have issues with some of their framing, so take this as a companion piece.</p>

<p>If we accept that Latin did in fact serve as an intermediary language due to fluency on both sides, then the question of ‘why Latin?’ entails an implicit question in the negative: why not Mongolian? Both the Qing and Muscovy-Russia had expanded into Inner Asia in part off the back of alliances with Mongolic and Turkic petty rulers, and by 1689 both sides would have had plenty of fluent Mongolian speakers and Mongolian-writing clerical staff. When you bear that in mind, Latin again seems like the less intuitive option. The reality is not that Latin was convenient, but that Latin was useful specifically to the Jesuits, who had secured the trust of the Qing court. The Jesuits firmly asserted that the Russians’ Mongolian translators were incompetent, and consistently protested against any attempt by the Russians to circumvent them by sending communications in Mongolian. While this could not <em>prevent</em> these apparently illicit messages from being sent, the court allowed itself to be swayed by the Jesuits and denounced the attempt to create Mongolian-language back-channels during the negotiations. Keeping all communications in Latin allowed the Jesuits to monopolise the process, something the Qing court was happy to indulge.</p>

<p>This is not so much a causal factor as a symbolic point, but it is worth also considering what the function of the Treaty of Nerchinsk was. You see, the Treaty of Nerchinsk was not simply the settling of a border agreement in outer Manchuria, though it certainly was part of it. In an implicit sense, it entailed the partitioning of Inner Asia into spheres of influence: one Russian, and one Manchu. Yet the people within the Qing part of said partition, the Mongolians, are absent from the text of the treaty, both in the sense of its substance and in terms of the language it was written in. Had the negotiators on the Qing side been Mongolian, how likely would they have been to sign away their own sovereignty by implicitly accepting that it was the Qing who determined if they were under Manchu suzerainty? The Jesuits, on the other hand, would have been direct representatives of the imperial centre, with no particular attachments to the peoples of its Inner Asian frontier. While it was the Jesuits themselves who insisted on Latin, rather than the Qing court, in doing so they still helped to reinforce the status of the Mongolians and Mongolia as what Perdue calls the ‘excluded middle’ in the treaty.</p>

<p>What I take some umbrage with is the notion that a translation into Manchu was somehow unusual. Firstly, Manchu was still the empire’s prestige language and retained that status – if in an increasingly shared role with literary Chinese – down to the overthrow of its ruling house in 1912. By 1689 the Qing were barely half a century post-conquest, and they had also just put down a major Han Chinese revolt (the Three Feudatories uprising) at the start of the decade; this was not the sort of environment in which an air of conciliation towards Han Chinese conservatives was really in the cards. Moreover, at this point, frontier affairs in Inner Asia were the exclusive purview of the Banners, which did include the so-called ‘Martial Han’, but which were in the main part the organising force for the empire’s Manchu elites. The Kangxi Emperor could not give less of a toss about the Han Chinese bureaucracy, because affairs in Inner Asia were not under their jurisdiction: frontier matters were <em>Manchu</em> matters.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I’m not particularly tuned in to Manchu, but there are some good resources out there. The Manchu studies community is small but relatively well organised digitally, and there’s a lot of open-access material via the <a href="https://www.manchustudiesgroup.org/">Manchu Studies Group</a>, including a journal, <a href="https://www.saksaha.org/">Saksaha</a>, although the latter is more for Qing and Manchu history than for literature (though there is some). As for books, unfortunately I don’t know of any, at least any from the last half century, that are about Manchu literature as such – most if not all are learning resources, dictionaries, and grammars.</p>

<p>—– <strong>426.1</strong> —–2022-12-10 15:46:26+08:00:</p>

<p>There are exactly two sexes.  There are also two “genders,” corresponding to masculinity and femininity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gender however, is currently seen by the mainstream as a spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gender is not a “spectrum,” however.  To explain why, I am noting a distinction between “gender” and “gender-related stereotypes.”  Gender as such is not a “gender-related stereotype” and a “gender-related stereotype” is not a gender.</p>

<p>Some “gender-related stereotypes” might have some association with masculinity and/or femininity, particularly where they are expressed/embodied in ways some might perceive as heteronormatively archetypal (such as a “man’s man” or “centerfold”). But new “genders” do not take form due to the emergence of new stereotypes associated with them.</p>

<p>Notably, the “gender-related stereotypes” we understand to have currency in our societies became more complex over time.</p>

<p>For example, in the 1950s, essentially all such “gender-related stereotypes” fell broadly within the categories of “masculine” and “feminine.”</p>

<p>At that time, there were “beefcakes” and “broads,” one might present as a “ladies’ man” or a “homewrecker,” and so on.  Now, those stereotypes have fallen out of social currency and the set of stereotypes peculiar to our moment in time are more varied and considerably more complex:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instead of “beefcakes,” there are “metrosexuals” and “twinks.”</li>
  <li>Instead of “broads,” there are “yaaas queens” and “basic bitches.”</li>
  <li>Instead of being a “ladies’ man,” men are hypermasculine to the point of being meme-worthy (see, e.g., the so-called “liver king”) or so limited in their expressed masculinity they are hardly identifiable as such (see, e.g., so-called “cat boys” or “fembois” of TikTok).</li>
  <li>Instead of “homewreckers,” women are encouraged by media to lead promiscuous lifestyles well beyond any context of a committed relationship (see, e.g., Sex and the City) or fantasize about subordinating themselves in the context of a “committed” relationship bearing no resemblance to any “home” that might be “wrecked” in any sense of that word (see, e.g., Fifty Shades of Gray).</li>
</ul>

<p>Our current “gender-related stereotypes” have also been influenced by things that have nothing to do with gender whatsoever.</p>

<p>And for some reason, that extraneous influence has further complicated the stereotype landscape.</p>

<p>For example, some argue that advancements in gay rights required redefining social norms (read: gender-related stereotypes) related to “gender.”  That idea is egregiously wrong.</p>

<p>Those arguments, in fact, misconstrued basic concepts, like performative expression for, among others, entertainment value (such as dressing up as a drag queen for a performance of some kind) or sexual gratification (such as crossdressing, for those into that kink).</p>

<p>Astonishingly, it turns out that new genders also do not take form by dressing up as a drag queen or other transvestite.  New stereotypes might.  But genders do not.  And those are not the same thing.</p>

<p>As a further example, some even argue that biology itself requires redefining those same “gender-related stereotypes.”  Few ideas so self-evidently wrong are expressed.  But the people who come up with them are too incompetent to know how wrong they are.  And their peers in the same or other normative fields are equally deficient.</p>

<p>As unmitigatedly audacious as unmoored from objective reality, they claim, for example, that genetic abnormalities, defects and congenital conditions are, in fact, no such thing.  Instead, they contend that a baby born with an extra copy of an X chromosome (i.e., one that has Klinefelter syndrome) is a natural expression of gender variance.  Even more nonsensical arguments have been made relating to sex.</p>

<p>And more astonishingly still, this lot argues the sum of these conditions is proof that gender and sex vary independently in nature.</p>

<p>This is what happens when someone with a Ph.D. in something that ends in “studies” talks about something that actually involves science.  Or when some college kid sitting in an undergraduate class taught be one of these idiots gets a whole bunch of stupid ideas in their head.</p>

<p>Note: I could obviously say more about other gender-related stereotypes, from other cultures, dating back to antiquity (particularly ancient Rome, ancient Greece and others, and continuing through at least the Victorian Era, the source of our modern gender-related stereotypes).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What the mainstream is trying to explain is that each person has different characteristics of the male and female archetype.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re on the right track there.  I think you are, at least.  But here’s what’s going on . . .</p>

<p>People are engaging in acts of self expression, and they’re trying to convince themselves and the world that somehow the sum of those actions change what “gender” is, both at their levels as individuals and at the level of society as a whole.</p>

<p>For example, a blue-haired, overweight, self-styled “lesbian” with multiple piercings that maintains a tumblr page replete with feeder pig pornography that also describes herself as “non-binary,” demands that the world use her “preferred pronouns.”</p>

<p>According to this individual, “ze” does not “identify” with “heteronormative stereotypes of masculinity and femininity,” and she has presumably reshaped herself accordingly.  Something is going on here.  But it has nothing whatsoever to do with gender.</p>

<p>Rather, this person is seeking socially validated individuality, where she is both recognized by her external world according to the language that she chooses and on terms of how she presents (e.g., as a blue-haired lesbian, as described above), exclusively.  This is a power-claim, before it is anything else.</p>

<p>As a further example, a bearded, overweight, self-styled “non-binary” self-styled “gay” man who is, ironically enough, both gay and  also “non-binary” wearing a conspicuous display of makeup, among other things, demands that Matt Walsh use his “preferred pronouns,” whatever those are (I don’t remember).</p>

<p>According to this individual, he also does not identify with the male/female stereotypes even though he can’t even state what they are.</p>

<p>Again, by demanding others’ use of certain pronouns and acceptance of his norm-defying appearance, he is making a power claim, before he is doing anything else.</p>

<p>None of this changes what gender is.  And it certainly doesn’t change what the sexes are.</p>

<p>Instead, people are just trying to find some sense of individuality, in a very misguided way.</p>

<p>Again, are exactly two genders (masculine and feminine), corresponding to the two sexes (male and female).  No others.  There are plenty of stereotypes associated with those genders, but those stereotypes are not genders and the two genders are categorically distinct from their associated stereotypes.</p>

<p>Moreover, how stereotypes are expressed by individuals does not give form to new genders.  All that’s happening is that people are pushing the limits of any such stereotype, in their pursuit of individuality (and in some cases, demand for external validation of that pursuit).</p>

<p>NOTE: I have slightly edited this for clarity.  I typed my original post late at night, and it wasn’t as clear as it I meant it to be.</p>

<p>—– <strong>426.2</strong> —–2022-12-11 01:39:49+08:00:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This either makes complete sense or none at all depending on how you define “gender”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it turns out, that preposterous game of “how you define ‘gender’” is the whole problem here.</p>

<p>There are people who use the term “gender” to refer to subjective expression of what, in reality, is absolutely nothing more than some expression of something tangentially connected to masculinity and/or femininity.</p>

<p>According to that lot, the array of those expressions amounts to a so-called “spectrum” of “gender identity.”</p>

<p>And then that same lot goes off to use the terms “gender” and “gender identity” as if they were interchangeable, which is how stupid ideas like “sex and gender vary independently in nature” emerge (and then enter our social discourse), from people who don’t even understand the concept of a chromosome.</p>

<p>That interchangeability in usage of “gender” and “gender identity” is why people think that the blue haired lesbian or self-styled “genderqueer” gay guy in my examples above can somehow be “non-binary.”</p>

<p>Here’s one of the most blatant problems: All being “non-binary” means is that you’re trying to express/embody something different than the conventionally understood stereotypes of “masculinity” and/or “femininity.”</p>

<p>Which is really to say, all that’s going on is people are pushing the boundaries of stereotypes (according to the current norms of masculinity and/or femininity) in an effort to express their individuality.</p>

<p>So, the term “gender identity” is totally incoherent.</p>

<p>The “identity” part of that phrase is just an individual’s description of how they decide to present themselves to their external world.</p>

<p>And the “gender” part of that phrase has nothing whatsoever to do with “gender” as such, only the current stereotypes of a given society/culture at some certain point in time.</p>

<p>To illustrate that point: Nero was not “non-binary” because he adorned himself with the attire of a bride and took a passive role with male concubines, any more than the blue-haired lesbian in my example above is non-binary because some of her behaviour parallels something our current norms would more commonly associate with masculinity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t matter the least whether they truly are that gender - as gender is a made up concept anyway, it’s not like sex which is biologically defined and definitive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn’t make sense.  You can’t “truly” be any “gender.”</p>

<p>But I think you’re on the right track, to the extent you mean gender is a social construct based on biology, and specifically the biological differences between “male” and “female.”  That is correct.</p>

<p>The issue we’re talking about relates to how those constructs are, in fact, socially constructed.</p>

<p>And the points I’ve made above relate to why that process of socially constructing them has resulted in a a lot of complete nonsense . . . which I think you are also agreeing with, even though we’re using different words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . everyone just chooses what they think gender really means based on whether the idea of these “new” genders seem appealing or uncomfortable to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s significant that even in having this conversation, we are not using language in the same way.</p>

<p>We should recognize the reason why, too.  That reason is because of all this stupidity in conflating:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the biological: male and female (i.e., sex);</li>
  <li>the socially constructed, based on the biological: masculine and feminine (i.e., genders);</li>
  <li>the stereotypes, based on those social constructs: what we’ve been talking about above (e.g., beefcake, ladies’ man, broad, homewrecker, catboy/femboi, yaas queen and so on); and</li>
  <li>how individual people express themselves, and the degree to which that expression aligns with or deviates from the set of such stereotypes that are peculiar to their society/culture.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that I have edited this for clarity, too.</p>

<p>—– <strong>426.3</strong> —–2022-12-11 02:18:29+08:00:</p>

<p>I do not understand why you thought, on the one hand, sexual orientation; and on the other hand, gender or gender identity, have anything to do with one another.  They do not.</p>

<p>I also do not understand why you thought some peoples’ opinions about gay marriage has anything to do with gender or gender identity.  These concepts also are unrelated.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to make a point about how obnoxious it is that some people cite a text as ostensibly “irrefutable proof of . . . rightness,” then we aren’t really talking about gender.</p>

<p>That’s an epistemological argument which has nothing to do with the OP whatsoever.  It’s also a bad epistemological argument, because the point you’re (fairly dogmatically) making is that everything is just an opinion.</p>

<p>But I assume you’re making that argument because these differences between what is biological, what is socially constructed (on top of the biological), what is also socially constructed on top of those social constructs and how individuals play around with those concepts (as well as misuse language to describe them) has not occurred to you.  Or if it has, you haven’t sorted them out for yourself.</p>

<p>A small part of me hoped you would rewrite your comments.  My expectations were too high, but I suppose they always are.  The reason I held out hope was because you approached a coherent thought, in recognizing the distinctions between sex and gender (as such).</p>

<p>Yet, you abandoned that path in your attempt to distinguish between “gender identity,” “gender expression” and “gender roles.”  You have simply drawn distinctions without differences, but to whatever extent there are any such differences, they are neither drawn nor drawable.</p>

<p>You have drawn no non-tautological distinction between any one of “gender” (1) “identity,” (2) “expression” or (3) “role[].”  For example, no line between any particular of “gender identity” or so-called “gender expression” is cognizable.  Nor is any line between “role” or “expression” cognizable.   As you have defined each of gender “identity,” “expression” and “role[],” all imply that each are discrete conceptual categories to which individuals may belong, yet the particularities of each arbitrarily converge (rendering all totally incoherent).</p>

<p>Nor, for that matter, have you defined or used those terms consistently with the published literature (to which you ostensibly claim some level of non-specific expertise).  As it turns out, you haven’t even conceptually distinguished the stereotypes (that I identified) from whatever you meant to communicate with those definitions.  To whatever extent you tried, it seems like you missed that all such stereotypes are, to use your exact words, “a complete social reality and is not biological.”  What it seems like you actually meant to say was simply that “gender is a social construct.”  Which I said initially.  But you failed to ascertain.  One wonders why.</p>

<p>In any case, maybe this will be a learning exercise for you.  Try to keep yourself on topic if you decide to respond.</p>

<p>The remainder of what I am responding to in this post is unmitigated trash you should have known better than to write.  Frankly, I am embarrassed on your behalf that you wrote it.  But you did.  So here we are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>your description comes straight out of a 2016 SJW “owned” compilation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I described two people whose actions reflected their efforts to pursue, and seek social validation of, their particular individuality in extreme ways.  In characterizing what I wrote as so-called “propaganda,” you at once concede the extremity of their actions (where extremity is measured by the extent of their non-conformity with social norms) and reinforce the validity of both examples (for the same reason).</p>

<blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Nothing in what I wrote even addressed the subject of how many people exist, that are like the examples I cited.</li>
  <li>Nothing in what I wrote even addressed the subject of whether any such people might be “representative of a majority.”</li>
</ol>

<p>I can’t even comprehend how you might have rationally misunderstood what I wrote to think I was addressing either of those subjects.  This is a basic reading comprehension issue of yours.  Don’t do that again.  That garbage may fly with your intro to philosophy professor, but it doesn’t cut it here.</p>

<p>Although if you thought trying to make a point about how those examples aren’t representative of any supposed majority actually rebutted what I wrote, we’ve got bigger problems.  What I said had nothing to do statistics, representativeness or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>But make no mistake, I was poking fun at both because of the absurdity of each of their situations.  That absurdity is both hilarious and engaging, after all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you are playing into the right-wing propaganda of the “trans agenda.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably the stupidest thing you said.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, you didn’t even define what the so-called “trans-agenda” is, so I have no idea what you’re even talking about.</li>
  <li>Second, neither of the people in my examples were even transsexual.  In fact, the only word I used that even contains the “trans” prefix was “transvestite,” which does not mean “transexual.”  So, either you just conflated all transexuals with transvestites (seriously, how ignorant/bigoted of you), or you made the — glaringly wrong — assumption that non-binary meant “trans,” which would place your first category into the same basket of incoherency I identified above.  I really thought you’d catch that if you re-read your comment and re-wrote it.  Clearly you failed to do so.</li>
  <li>Third, there is no “trans agenda,” and even if there was it is beyond obnoxious of you to assume that there is any coherent “right-wing propaganda” relating to it.  Not to mention laughably absurd for you to assume I was “playing into it.”  I assume you made that nonsensical assumption because I referenced Matt Walsh and that episode of Dr. Phil where the second individual in my examples above appeared.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your speculations about my politics are absolutely irrelevant to the points I made.  Why you would even mention the subject, I can only speculate (that you thought you would somehow win brownie points by some pedestrian effort to discredit what I said because it purportedly aligned with some free-floating notion of so-called “right wing propaganda”).</p>

<p>Further, your lamentations about so-called “right wing propaganda” are unhelpful to your cause.  Do they not teach that ad hominem is fallacy, in your little philosophy program?  Please ask that your school refund your student loans, if so.  As it also turns out, I’m also gay, quite fond of Euphoria (including Hunter Schaefer’s character, Jules) and I voted for Hillary Clinton.  I came here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNl3jvApJqU&amp;ab_channel=UniversalPicturesAll-Access">for a proper discussion</a>, but you were too busy talking nonsense.</p>

  <p>I was on topic. The length of my response does not indicate that I’m “not on topic” because I am. I also know that you are saying this because of the whole propaganda thing, which you have taken great issue to, so we will get to that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere in your four-part missive have you explained how your initial definitions are non-tautological.  In reality, all you managed to accomplish was  situate your perspective amidst greater incoherency.</p>

<p>It is assumed that you conceded my other points, however.  After all, you have dropped your initial (irrelevant) points relating to proportionality and representativeness.  Now, you have changed the subject(s) again and proceeded down entirely different paths, even further removed from my initial points concerning the example individuals’ pursuit of their own individuality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I’m waaaayyy past an “intro to philosophy” course . . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That certainly can’t be ascertained from your writing.  You began you’re missive focusing on issues that are irrelevant to the points I’ve made, to advance circular arguments based on concepts you can’t even coherently describe.  It’s not obvious even you understand what your point was.  With that in mind, how could anyone else?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Reading your bullshit reminds me of what I would expect from a high school kid engaged in policy debate, on a saturday morning where I’d rather sleep in.</p>

<p>First, you bigotedly conflate transvestites and transgender persons.</p>

<p>Now, you’re alluding to “racial antisemitic caracatures.”</p>

<p>When it turns out, the whole discussion was about gender identity . . . a subject that concerns neither, for reasons I have already said.</p>

<p>To make this point explicitly clear: we are not disagreeing that people have, and ought to have, complete bodily autonomy.  Instead, we are disagreeing about how you incorrectly framed the issues raised by Canada’s expansion of “euthanasia.”  Your error is in assuming that bodily autonomy is the issue, when it is not.

<p>—– <strong>322.1</strong> —–2022-12-05 13:53:04+08:00:</p>

<p><strong>From Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany:</strong> Periods of relative peace and prosperity in human history, such as the one that most of the world experienced in the early post–Cold War era, need not be rare interludes or mere deviations from a historical norm in which brute force dictates the rules. And although we cannot turn back the clock, we can still turn back the tide of aggression and imperialism. Today’s complex, multipolar world renders this task more challenging. To carry it out, Germany and its partners in the EU, the United States, the G-7, and NATO must protect our open societies, stand up for our democratic values, and strengthen our alliances and partnerships. But we must also avoid the temptation to once again divide the world into blocs. This means making every effort to build new partnerships, pragmatically and without ideological blinders. In today’s densely interconnected world, the goal of advancing peace, prosperity, and human freedom calls for a different mindset and different tools. Developing that mindset and those tools is ultimately what the Zeitenwende is all about.</p>

<p><strong>From Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage:</strong> Putin could lose in Kherson, or elsewhere in Ukraine, and accept his losses. He could even lose the Donbas, part of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since 2014, and make do politically. But Putin surely regards losing Crimea and surviving as president as irreconcilable. He will go to great lengths to hold on to Crimea. … At every moment, Ukraine should make Russia fear an invasion of Crimea. For the time being, however, it is wise to pin and isolate Russian soldiers in Crimea without seeking to reconquer the peninsula. This strategy would give Kyiv a strong position in future negotiations with Russia, possibly convincing the Kremlin to enter such talks in earnest. It would help maintain unity among Ukraine’s Western partners worried about escalation risks. More immediately, Ukraine can try to break up the land bridge to Crimea, separating Russia’s forces in the south from its forces in the east and regaining access to the Sea of Azov. A costly and dangerous campaign to retake the peninsula now might put at risk the counteroffensive Ukraine has been so brilliantly waging since September.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spinkcat在2022-12-05~2022-12-11的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-07/Spinkcat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spinkcat在2022-12-05~2022-12-11的言论" /><published>2022-12-07T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-07/Spinkcat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-07/Spinkcat/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>容易脱离实际，是看起来似是而非的一种过滤器，刚开始接触社会和政治容易被兜住，要是停在这个步骤就习惯了，形成思考舒适区，作为政治立场和取向的依托，就很容易进入一个死胡同，这就是过滤器的意思。</p>

<p>大体是那种，当你对未来中国走向产生疑惑和不解，就有一个解释来到你面前，它可以作为你入门思考的开端，但是当社会现实，要求你从人的日常生活，社会怎么运作，经济怎么处理，到底该选择在哪里作为终点，都需要考虑。</p>

<p>不考虑任何政治上的问题，单纯从经济角度考虑，可能随便一个地方人口流动、户籍身份、经济结构的问题推演下去，就会出现逻辑无法自洽的情况，也就是说不考虑任何“应不应该”，它都可能无法执行下去。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1918.1</strong> —–2022-12-07 23:43:05+08:00:</p>

<p>未来世界随着工业革命的进一步发展，新式产品越来越多，需求本身在不断被扩大，对人口单体的消费能力需求也越来越高，我想这是主要增长点，但中印的人口过多，很难迅速转型，可能回处于一个中长期的过渡阶段。</p>

<p>而人口多但人均消费能力强，意味着中低端消费品的市场庞大，如果局部人口能匹配到发达国家近似的消费能力，才有可能带动更高的内需消费增长，否则本国这部分人口要么享受高价的进口高质量产品，要么承担消费不足的需求问题，被迫选择润出去，或者留在内部成为改革的压力来源。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1918.2</strong> —–2022-12-12 16:34:27+08:00:</p>

<p>国内在迫切需要内需时，沿海地区发达化的人口作为消费主力不能承担这份重担制造需求，从而把市场导向国内的话，就会导致发达人口用高价买外国市场产品。</p>

<p>要么就会出现不怎么能买得起国外的高质量产品，但是国内的东西质量又特别差，不用也没钱去享受国外产品。</p>

<p>变相等于生活质量下降，因为国内非发达地区市场的生产质量与消费水平，不足以支撑起一个跟国外市场竞争的程度，那发达人口人数多的话，就意味着外部进口需求大。</p>

<p>但是外部需求大，国外产能是有限的，追求生活质量时，对国外货物需求会比实际进口的多，那进口价自然会上涨（主要是加工产品，原材料可能更便宜）</p>

<p>反过来，很多发达国家内部市场的供需稳定，都是源自于让大多数人口能生产本地所需，在技术和质量进步后，获得相对国外产品价格、质量一致的产品，有优秀的还能出口，这样才能维持生活水平。</p>

<p>也就是说是这样一个模型，如果不能建立内需消费社会的话。</p>

<p>10单位发展中人口-生产低质量的产品</p>

<p>2单位发达人口-需求高质量产品</p>

<p>外部市场生产1单位高质量产品</p>

<p>发达人口的需求与外部市场的产能是2：1，价格自然高涨</p>

<p>但追求高质量生活又是基本需求，而国内不能满足这点，发达人口想要生活质量就必须承受，你不承受赚钱就没意义，你承受就要付出高于其他发达地区的成本。</p>

<p>当然实际不可能一点高质量产品都没有，还是有的，但肯定不足够消费，现在社会环境更多是没到那个地步，重要还是做高质量产品的企业因为内需上不去生存不下来，形成恶性循环了。</p>

<p>所以在本国享受不到合理物价带来的高质量生活的知识分子、中产，普遍都选择润了，这也是成本最低的做法。</p>

<p>良性结构应该是：</p>

<p>8单位发展中人口-生产低质量产品</p>

<p>2单位发展中、近发达人口-生产、需求高质量产品</p>

<p>2单位发达人口-需求高质量产品</p>

<p>外部市场生产和输入1单位高质量产品</p>

<p>这样就形成一个良性循环，本地的质量、文化和使用习惯都比外来产品更有优势，数量价格上也是，可以不断把发展中人口带向发达化，形成滚雪球。</p>

<p>而不是好不容易本地出来发达人口，结果他们累积足够后，发现本地不行，跑路到其他国家消费，那本地积攒这么多年，没发展起来的人怎么办？</p>

<p>需求是非常难培养的，高质量产品附加值也高，1单位高质量人口的需求，可能养活3-4个单位的发展中人口高速累积财富。</p>

<p>所以资金外流，人才外流，这些发达人口因社会制度与政治因素外流，对国内的长期经济发展损害比想的大，因为人家不在你境内消费了，你境内无论税收还是企业营收都赚不到这笔需求。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2022-11-28~2022-12-04的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-04/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2022-11-28~2022-12-04的言论" /><published>2022-12-04T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-04/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-04/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>For a bit of extra trivia I couldn’t fit into the writeup itself, the one semi-genuine Japanese song in <em>The Mikado</em> is the one titled ‘Mi-ya sa-ma’, a somewhat re-keyed version of a military tune titled ‘Ton-yare Bushi’, also known as ‘Miyasan’, written during the Boshin War in 1868. The titular <em>Miyasan</em> (imperial prince) almost certainly referred to Komatsu Akihito, the ceremonial commander-in-chief of the imperial armies, who, as the story goes may well have been in attendance during <em>The Mikado</em>’s opening run.</p>

<p>I did almost engage a bit with these two shows, but ran out of space. The short answer is that it’s complicated. On the one hand, <em>Turandot</em> and <em>Madame Butterfly</em> derive a certain degree of greater artistic shielding by being grand opera rather than more down-to-earth comic opera, but on the other hand, <em>The Mikado</em>’s comic-satirical nature gives it a certain degree of leeway: problematic as the text is, it is arguably devoid of any outright malice.</p>

<p>You’re right, that <em>is</em> an omission. I may go back and edit something in on that. At the same time it’s an odd sort of nothingburger in the end: when US producers remarked on the offensiveness, the D’Oyly Carte company duly noted the issue and edited the libretto going forward.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it appears to only exist in allusion and is never described at great length, at least in terms of the versions pitched to Sullivan. However, Gilbert did ultimately manage to produce a version of his lozenge plot in conjunction with composer Alfred Cellier, producing <a href="https://gsarchive.net/gilbert/plays/mountebanks/mountebanks_home.html"><em>The Mountebanks</em></a>, a show in which a magic potion enables people to transform into the people they pretend to be.</p>

<p>Gilbert had definitely got into some hot water with the Lord Chamberlain at times (this being when the Lord Chamberlain was still the theatre censor). According to Andrew Goodman’s brief article on the ban on <em>The Mikado</em> during Prince Fushimi’s tour, his major brush with the censors had been over an 1873 burlesque which mocked then-Prime Minister William Gladstone, Chancellor Robert Lowe, and Commissioner of Works Acton Ayrton. Performances were suspended until the caricatures were less obvious, which was apparently resolved by some costume modifications as well as making ‘Gladstone’ dress up as Guy Fawkes. So Gilbert was certainly aware of the arbitrary hand of the Lord Chancellor if he made his mockeries too overt.</p>

<p>I discuss this somewhat in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/juiswk/why_are_chinese_emperors_from_the_ming_and_qing/gce7w71/">this answer</a>, but to put it bluntly, naming conventions changed over time. Emperors from the Han to the Sui tend to be referred to by posthumous name, Tang through Song are usually referred to by temple name, Yuan emperors are typically referred to by their Mongolian personal name, and Ming and Qing emperors are typically referred to via era names (via the [X Emperor] format rather than [Emperor X]), though you can find some historians who prefer temple names instead. There’s always the odd exception, such as the Ming emperor Yingzong, who is known via temple name as he had two separate reigns, but there’s a mini-exception to that too, as the Qing Tongzhi Emperor is known as such despite having briefly been the Qixiang Emperor at the start of his reign. But as a general set of conventions over time, the above holds true.</p>

<p>—– <strong>957.2</strong> —–2022-12-02 06:30:32+08:00:</p>

<p>The long and short of it is that they were typically simply ‘the emperor’ or a synonym thereof. As for posthumous names, the typical convention is to take the last character (so for instance Fantian Hedao Zhesu Dunjian Guangwen Zhangwu Anren Zhixiao Xian Huangdi 範天合道哲肅敦簡光文章武安仁止孝顯皇帝 is also simply Emperor Xian).</p>

<p>As you note your answer is mostly the Tibetan perspective, and to give mine from the Qing standpoint, at least in brief, I do think we ought to see Tibet as having been conceived as being within the Qing Empire from about 1720 onwards, as opposed to either a tributary (in the sense of an independent state with limited and voluntary recognition of at least ceremonial Qing suzerainty) or a protectorate (in the sense of a largely unidirectional policy of military defence). The presence of an imperial resident in Lhasa from 1720 onward implied a level of Qing presence well above and beyond any other ‘tributary’ state, as the Qing as a rule did not send residents to their tributaries: the <em>one</em> exception I know of is the assignment of Yuan Shikai to Korea in 1885. However this was not necessarily direct rule, in that the Ganden Podrang functioned as a devolved government under moderate Qing supervision, and one capable of a certain amount of independent liaising with other elements within the empire.</p>

<p>The 1792 turning point is less significant in terms of ‘was Tibet part of the empire?’ and more in terms of the autonomy of the Tibetan administration and priesthood. I’m not as familiar with the specific legal privileges granted to the <em>ambans</em>, but even just looking at the Golden Urn, that was a pretty powerful tool for consolidating Qing authority. It meant that the Tibetan clergy could no longer sustain their old patronage networks in Inner Asia, and effectively meant that the only lasting patron-priest/donor-preceptor (take your pick) relationship they could sustain would be that with the Qing court. So it would not have been an act that situated Tibet in the Qing Empire (where the Qing already believed it was), but rather one that put an end to the Tibetan clergy’s ability to independently negotiate with other loci of power within the empire.</p>

<p>Anyway, just some musings based mainly off Max Oidtmann’s <em>The Golden Urn</em>.</p>

<p>—– <strong>958.2</strong> —–2022-12-09 03:44:47+08:00:</p>

<p>The Gurkha invasion in 1792 is really interesting as a point of discussion around Tibet’s position within the Qing Empire. The thing is that the Qing already had a garrison in Tibet which had successfully headed off an earlier Gurkha attack in 1788. Except as you may know, it didn’t – the Qing officers on the ground had done nothing and the Gurkhas had been bought off. So when the second attack came in 1791-2 in response to a failure by the Tibetans to pay up, it made significant gains, including looting the monastery at Trashi Lhünpo which had recently received a major donation from the Qianlong Emperor. While the Qing sent troops to beat back the later invasion and succeeded over the course of 1792, it’s worth considering that from the Qing standpoint, they had already been responsible for Tibet’s military defence well beforehand, but that in 1788, they <em>failed</em> to act, rather than it not actually being within their purview.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider is that the 1788 attack had been preceded by an inheritance dispute after the death of the Sixth Panchen Lama, leading to the Tenth Zhamarpa Lama fleeing to Nepal and becoming an advisor to the Nepalese court. The Qing, at least officially, blamed the absconded lama for the Gurkha invasion in 1791, citing his alleged lust for the treasures at Trashi Lhünpo and claiming that he had given away Qing military secrets. Because of that, the increased military presence in Tibet went hand-in-hand with the matter of the Golden Urn, because from the imperial standpoint, the Gurkha invasions had been made possible because of the venality of the Tibetan clergy, at the root of which was the ability to arbitrarily decide on reincarnation candidates, and keep new lamas coming from aristocratic lineages.</p>

<p>Oidtmann’s argument would be that it was in fact the Golden Urn that was the bigger implication of 1792, not least because it was the first response, rather than any military enlargement. In introducing the Urn, the Qing rearranged Tibet’s position within the empire, from being part of a web of negotiated relationships between different interest groups towards a more unidirectional relationship with the imperial court.</p>

<p>VTuber agency VShojo has just announced a new member, and people are annoyed. So, what exactly is going on?</p>

<p>As a general introduction, on paper VShojo is one of the sort of ‘big three’ VTuber agencies alongside Hololive and Nijisanji, albeit occupying a different market niche: Whereas Hololive and Nijisanji are Japanese agencies with an English presence and primarily active on Youtube, VShojo operates primarily on Twitch and was, until recently, solely English-language. Its <em>modus operandi</em> is also distinct: whereas the other two agencies might be described as ‘vertically integrated’ entities where VTubers’ character IPs are owned by the agency, and members essentially audition for a role initially cast by the agency, VShojo functions more like a voluntary association of existing creators. All of its founding members (Nyanners, Zentreya, Ironmouse, Silvervale, and Projekt Melody) were existing VTubers, although it did then debut two members new to the VTubing sphere: Froot and Hime Hajime. Since then, it’s also added Veibae and Kson, both also established VTubers, and Amemiya Nazuna, who was active before but under a different identity. Basically, VShojo functions less as an agency capable of pulling smaller content creators up through the ranks, and more as a club for existing heavyweights – Froot and Hime excepted.</p>

<p>VShojo’s messaging is also a little abrasive, to put it mildly. Its rejoinder of ‘talent freedom’ as its main selling point can be read as a jab aimed particularly at Hololive, which in the Anglophone fandom has a bit of a reputation as being a highly controlling agency with a lot of constraints on its members’ activities. In effect, it acts like it breaks the rules set by other agencies and has none of its own, and acts basically like the underdog, representing the side of VTubing rooted in the Anglophone indie space as opposed to the much more structured, agency-heavy Japanese scene.</p>

<p>But for some, the image of VShojo as the vanguard of the EN indie scene and the reality of its relatively exclusive membership have reached an increasing point of irreconcilability, relating primarily to a <em>huge</em> amount of controversy relating to its auditions. In August 2021, VShojo <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VShojo/comments/p894j7/announcement_auditions_for_vshojo_start/">formally announced that it was opening up auditions</a>. For a while, basically the only new information was <a href="https://twitter.com/vshojoofficial/status/1456066454718189579?lang=en">an official update</a> on 21 November (of 2021, mind you), and <a href="https://twitter.com/vshojoofficial/status/1495824212287803400">another update</a> on 21 February 2022.</p>

<p>In some spaces, the deafening silence of VShojo on the subject of its auditions became a running joke, but this was one with a serious streak: the 21 November update had come in the wake of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/qywp8u/hobby_scuffles_week_of_november_22_2021/hlu7l3d/">major scandal</a> involving a schism between dramatuber edgelord Nux Taku and agency management over phishing scams by people impersonating VShojo’s audition team. The Nux drama had seen a huge amount of bad blood come up because he had apparently revealed the existence of these scams despite the agency supposedly advising him otherwise in order not to compromise their investigation, leading to a flurry of confused messaging from VShojo members, some of whom latterly backtracked after it became apparent that Nux was – at least this time – not entirely incorrect, at least not in all regards.</p>

<p>Minor flareups occurred earlier this year when Kson and Nazuna joined VShojo in July. That Kson might have been one of the 2021 auditionees can’t be ruled out, but Nazuna almost <em>certainly</em> wasn’t. Whereas Kson is bilingual, Nazuna is basically Japanese-only; moreover, Nazuna’s past is significant here, as she was unlikely to be in a position to want to audition at the time that the process was taking place, but she <em>would</em> have been in a position to get in after February 2022; plus she was known to be a friend of Kson’s. (More specifically: &gt;!at the time, Nazuna was still Hololive’s Rushia, the second-highest-earning VTuber in the world, and leaving for VShojo would have meant starting from near-scratch with no guarantee of greater success; however she was later <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/yzkffy/virtual_youtubers_identities_in_discord_the/">terminated from the agency in February</a>.!&lt;) So here everyone was, 11 months since the auditions, and yet Kson had come in – without any connection with those auditions – <em>and</em> brought a friend along with no prior presence as the Nazuna character, which was created within a less than 5-month window. Unsurprisingly, this led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/wop0f6/ama_announcement_from_prism_projectweekly_wild/ikuprd6/">some</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/vly1v1/super_sweaty_summer_weekly_discussion_thread_june/iemwkdy/?context=999">questions</a> about whether VShojo was taking the piss in relation to the auditions process.</p>

<p>Well, we now have our announcement: the new VShojo member – yes, ‘new’ in the singular – is (drum roll please)…….. <a href="https://twitter.com/haruka_karibu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Haruka Karibu</a>!</p>

<p>People are… <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/z7020y/disproportionately_drunk_dudes_weekly_discussion/iytfsoe/">ambivalent</a>. Nobody really begrudges Karibu the chance to be formally part of VShojo, but there’s a lot of grumbling that instead of a genuinely small indie creator, it’s someone who already has 180k Twitch followers (which is still smaller than most of VShojo’s existing members, it must be said), but more critically someone who has had a relatively long history of collaborating with VShojo members, rather than being a smaller indie talent. Why, if VShojo was so keen on advertising itself as the agency for EN indies, was it not bringing on a wider range of content creators outside established talents? Why was the one (1) successful applicant someone who was already friends with several people in the agency?</p>

<p>And this aspect is where some of the more ‘integrated’ Japanese agencies come off looking really quite good in comparison. Take Hololive’s recent debuts: nigh on everyone has some level of prior content creation experience, but there’s a mix of people from varying ranges of popularity. HoloEN Gen 2 had one member with no VTuber experience and three who only did a bit on the side; HoloJP Gen 6 was a similar situation, where all but one were relatively obscure; until recently, only <em>one</em> of HoloID Gen 3’s members had been traced to a past identity, in this case as a small-time indie VTuber. In general, new debutants are experienced but not established as VTubers. It’s something that can slice either way as to whether it’s a good or a bad thing, but it’s not surprising that Hololive’s tendency to also admit ‘outsider’ candidates was raised by some users as a point in favour.</p>

<p>So, to dig up the old can of worms, I definitely was not 100% on board with how Lindsay Ellis handled the Raya situation, but I never had any issues with her videos. As for Sarah Z, I’m not in enough of the fandoms she covers to say with any certainty if she’s right or wrong on certain takes, but I will say that I didn’t stand for her denunciation of Top Gun: Maverick as US Navy propaganda. I mean, that is correct, but it is also a genuinely good film where planes go whoosh and pew pew.</p>

<p>1964’s <em>Zulu</em> is famous as the film that essentially launched Michael Caine’s career (ironic given it was supposed to be Stanley Baker’s star vehicle, but I digress). It is also famously the film in which Caine exclaims, ‘Zulus! Thousands of ‘em!’ Or indeed, ‘<em>faaahzands</em> of ‘em!’</p>

<p>Except… it isn’t. Some variation on the line is said twice: the first is at roughly the 59-minute mark by Nigel Green as Colour Sergeant Bourne, who declares ‘The sentries report Zulus to the southwest, thousands of them.’ The second is around the 1hr45m mark when James Booth’s Private Hook tries to flee the hospital and sees the Zulus about to break through the door: ‘Quick! Thousands of ‘em!’ Michael Caine’s character, who speaks with an upper-class English accent rather than the actor’s typical Cockney, says nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>However, <em>Zulu</em> is also famous as the film where Michael Caine exclaims ‘Stop throwing those bloody spears at me!’</p>

<p>Except… it isn’t. The line is never said by <em>anyone</em> in that film, in which throwing spears never even share the screen with Caine (though a good few redcoats do get nailed by a thrown <em>assegai</em> at various points). Those who note the line’s absence from <em>Zulu</em> often point out that it is actually from a <em>different</em> Michael Caine role, as Peachey Carnehan in the 1975 film <em>The Man Who Would Be King</em>, the <em>other</em> film in which he appears in a pith helmet and a red uniform.</p>

<p>Except… it isn’t. The line does not appear in that film either. ‘Stop throwing those bloody spears at me!’ is now a line permanently associated with the film <em>Zulu</em> and more broadly with the early career of Michael Caine, despite this never actually having been said on the big screen.</p>

<p>(Clarification if needed: ideally, there wouldn’t be harassment to crack down on at all and this serves to remind us that it does exist and that it is bad, but seeing as there is harassment, it’s really good to see the big players team up and publicly state that they will do something about it.)</p>

<p>FWIW there’s also arguably a qualitative difference between consistently-running series that are regular staples <em>expected</em> to go on indefinitely, versus seasonal anime which live and die based on whether new seasons and films are commissioned.

<p>经济发展是谁带来的？搞清楚这个问题。</p>

<p>现在产业已经发展到极限，接下来就是政治改革才能进一步让产业升级实现，如果不改，卡在现在的关头，结果就是比跟中东许多国家一样。</p>

<p>知识分子与中产外逃，全球市场里可被取代性增加，而统治阶级不愿意分出权力去构筑公平社会，进而被迫需要更多暴力镇压。</p>

<p>最后结果是经济被搞垮，国家本身已经又烂又没起色，统治阶级本身因为不愿放权，也没培养稳定的权力交接和反对党，因此一旦遭遇长期不满导致的民变，就会出现权力真空。</p>

<p>没有产业和经济填补的社会，在既得利益集团造成这种局面之前就已经形成了，之后一切不过是既得利益集团的错误决定，把所有人拖下水而已。</p>

<p>你是要守着这个既得利益集团，求这一会的安稳，然后自己和下一代非常痛苦，还是咬咬牙，必须趁着客观条件还可以，趁早剔除身上的毒瘤，让社会尽快重启，进行经济和产业的转型，让社会更公平有更高的收入增长呢？</p>

<p>一大群人聚集起来喊共产党下台和习近平下台，这个行为已经是历史的一个分水岭了。</p>

<p>我发现很多人其实完全没意识到，上述这个情况发生有多大的政治意义。</p>

<p>共产党核心腹地城市，还是同时间在多个主要城市的繁华地段，甚至北京，六四后第一次出现这种情况，也是第一次官方和内地未来社运博弈，他们反应比预期慢，我们学到了很多东西，政治上的进步非常多。</p>

<p>已经是在逐步从政治上打破岁月静好本身，不能不切实际指望振臂一呼就哗啦哗啦“觉醒”了，而是要想办法褪去日常感。</p>

<p>尤其是要逼中共把社运的政治矛盾摆上台，就跟香港一样。</p>

<p>到现在为止官方还没公开出来说，也没承认什么，如果他们后续出来批判颜色革命，到处都在宣扬，甚至上了央视，那对我们反贼简直是求之不得。</p>

<p>也许有低谷，但大家已经知道这件事了，导火索未来要多少有多少，反正经济趋势从政治上是有利于我们的。</p>

<p>退而求其次，哪怕没直接喊出来，只要叫了不要XX要XX，这个口号很多用的人都知道出自哪，中共也知道出自哪，更清楚你用这个的真正意图。</p>

<p>这样彼此心知肚明，算摊牌了，之后还有不少节点要进一步对垒 。</p>

<p>那问题来了，为什么中共不自己培育一个反对党或阶层，建立一套权力交接机制，在自己撑不住时可以顺利安全过渡呢。</p>

<p>如果他们自己不做，那实际上所有问题都要归结于在他们任内导致的一系列问题，随着他们崩溃被曝光出来。</p>

<p>当命题来到“为何中共停止改革”时，就会出现一系列新疑问，假设当前状况中共已经给不了更好，并且持续在恶化，那社会也不该原地踏步，该踢掉中共前行了。</p>

<p>至于之后遇到什么中共带来的恶果，都是新政权给他们擦屁股，而不是新政权带来的。</p>

<p>正相反，新政权是为了解决这些问题才诞生的产物，哪怕可能很困难，但始终也是在解决，而非中共一般完全停滞。</p>

<p>因此变成什么国家，取决于中共的下限，大清不早改革，留下一个烂摊子，肯定不是孙中山的错。</p>

<p>人民币几乎不可能成为金圆券那样的情况，蒋介石的金圆券已经是完全脱离经济规律的产物，超发带来的通胀等于日本侵华四十六年， 半年时间贬值6424倍，而且中国社会庞大，生产产品多，人民币锚点相对还是有的。</p>

<p>实际上也不需要人民币通胀到那个地步，只要政府基层部门的资金流转，跟不上开销就行，人民币通胀只是加剧这一点，蒋介石不懂经济为了前线开销半年把自己经济干死，财政储备差不多快消耗完了才不顾一切。</p>

<p>这就是政治路线和立场之争，如果都是个人表达自己的，就很难统一观点和所属。</p>

<p>就好比现在这个环境，各说各的本质是鸡同鸭讲，全程驴唇不对马嘴。</p>

<p>既不能说因为我要香港独立，所以你们抗争我不支持，而且你们大陆抗争我还会背刺把你出卖给中共看你死。</p>

<p>更不能说你们是黑暴废青所以轮不到你们来参与，自认为不是一个阵线。</p>

<p>而是说，虽然你们希望香港独立，但大方向大家是一致的，起码是可以商量交流，以及说“哦，我是对香港的有看法，但是个人观点，不能凌驾于公众和集体利益之上”。</p>

<p>就是…这是最基本的人话，非常好理解，完全没有必要搞矛盾对立起来。</p>

<p>乐者为同，礼者为异。同则相亲，异则相敬，乐胜则流，礼胜则离。求同存异，很简单的事，我相信大部分人能拎得清，但是一吵起来就是人与人的单线沟通，这就是当下去中心化的坏处。</p>

<p>这也是为什么有必要组织一个实体，代表的是一种立场和观点，比如说对其他地区反贼偏温和，主张戮力向前，那你要是不接受，非说我看到港独台独我就不共戴天，就不可能被接纳为这个组织的一部分，反过来说中华胶的一样，国内社运还不成熟，但香港运动里这种戾气是很普遍的，别说对大陆，对内武勇与温和派别都很难统一，应引以为戒。</p>

<p>当未来基层空间允许政治实体进行组织，存在于社会当中时，这些组织可以简明立场与观点，彼此进行交流，至于个体，你接受就留下成为一部分一起出力，不接受那也没法一起工作。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1880.1</strong> —–2022-11-30 01:13:16+08:00:</p>

<p>从香港运动到现在的一系列经验累积，我自己临时总结了一些粗略观点，也写个二十条（但不是最终版本）：</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>1.去中心化行不通，必须进行建立组织。（或者说，去中心化是当局强势的产物，会随状况改变必然出现变化。）</p>

<p>2.暴力革命不是必要的，但必须有能力发动暴力革命，因此武装的建立有绝对迫切性。</p>

<p>3.组织和武装两者的建立是区分社会运动与革命的关键，因为敌人是没有任何下限的存在，既不会接受和平运动的施压，也不会安心放权。</p>

<p>4.社会当中会随着旧政权威信和管制力下降，出现内部的既得利益妥协者、换皮人，以及来自民间保守主义建制支持者的自我组织，他们可能在组织因为体制内的原因有先发优势，这也是建立组织的原因之一。</p>

<p>5.未来政治矛盾的聚焦点，是社会分配、公平性的改革，因此比起政治生态本身，应更多关注政治引起的民生矛盾，通过经济改革获得大幅度政治改革的基础。</p>

<p>6.经济改革的最终目的，是为了政治改革进行铺路，塑造适合选举的社会环境。</p>

<p>7.团结目标应是尽可能争取所有人，包括大多数反对者，政治立场上应该提出有利益所有人的方向。（这听起来很像废话，但很多人应该明白实际做了有多容易偏离而被情绪化主导的情况。）</p>

<p>8.资源需倾侧向中小企业，为创造大量劳动岗位提供优渥土壤，在这个基础上才能改善劳动待遇，为基层提供工会来团结劳工，逐步实现迁徙自由，来团结农民与乡镇人口。</p>

<p>提供开放的文艺创作环境与新闻自由、健全法律获得知识分子在内的传统中产阶级支持，多数年轻人与白领、学生为主的城市阶级，则需要用复合路线。</p>

<p>9.不追求暴力清算，但追缴国有资产在条件允许下应彻底执行，除少数性质恶劣外，其他都应酌情处理，避免李傕郭汜事件发生。</p>

<p>10.无妥善安排前，不应对现有公务员体制进行人事变动，除关键领域外，分批下放国企或合并国企，减少行政与资源浪费开销。</p>

<p>11.逐渐结束分税制、户籍制度、土地财政，但需以社会稳定性为优先考虑，避免过热冒进。</p>

<p>12.进行组织的最佳时间点，在中共财政到达一定匮竭临界点下，地方出现权力真空，社会的混乱度与秩序失衡，允许群众的自发秩序能进行组织和串联，在这种背景下发展组织可以得到最大掩护。</p>

<p>13.组织所发动社会运动乃至革命的核心发源地，应该以沿海广东、江浙为主，广东为核心，江浙为辅，因为处于人口集中地区，远离北京中央，北方省份保守主义居大多数。</p>

<p>而南方几个省份经济高度发达，进步主义更明显，背靠香港、台湾，云南接壤东南亚诸国，这些地区资源与武器流入都相对容易，掌控后有更多税源、人力、货运。且有附近有丛林、大量建成区、山地，对游击与隐秘组织有优势，又易于补给，不会有冬天过度寒冷的问题。</p>

<p>14.减少被左右派身份立场定义的可能，但也要避免不粘锅导致两面不讨好，主流背景下以偏右身份实行大量左倾社会政策，可以避免保守主义者打左派旗帜有生存空间，走完这条路让他们无法以此形成凝聚力。</p>

<p>15.全国人口当中，其中绝大部分并无特定政治立场，也即是日子人或骑墙派，可以称之为政治被动者。会对政治有积极反馈的，可以称之为政治主动者。</p>

<p>不需要考虑政治被动者所接收到信息偏差带来的立场问题，这不改变政府财政溃烂下的真空出现，他们只需要生存所需的金钱，因此组织要有资源，能跟官方或保守主义对立者去竞争这群人。假设没有和平演变，并且最后民间有能力进行组织去与保守主义者拉锯对抗，那么主要聚焦的就是以政治路线吸引政治主动者的支持，通过经济和资源优势，来获取政治被动者的支持。</p>

<p>16.一线到十八线城市是税收主要来源，农村是原材料、人力主要来源，两者需要互补，通过控制财政崩溃的农村到城乡结合部，再到控制三线城市来逐渐吞噬庞大的一线城市是可行的，但传统农村路线不能照搬，现代高度城市化，直接控制一线城市的可能性是存在的。</p>

<p>17.六四后三十余年，社会处于一种虚假的稳定错觉，打破这种错觉是很重要的，意味着让中国大众清醒意识到社会开始进入一个特殊时期，因此越是能给当局财政带来无上限开销的行动都能加速社会特殊化的进程，官方对社运越是在公开场合批判，越能凸显不稳定的趋势。</p>

<p>18.在环境成熟前，需要更多人能理解为什么中共必须下台，以及中国经济与社会病症根结所在，因此需要强调共和国国本的分税制、户籍制、土地财政，这些形成政府基础的病态制度，从最根源的地方上攻击对方的理论错误，并且事实会随着时间发展证明这些批判是正确的。</p>

<p>哪怕在当下也可以看得到对应三个最大的群体，土地财政影响全国房价，户籍制度限制人口流动制造资源稀缺，分税制限制地方施政为整个制度供血。</p>

<p>19.当越来越多的人能理解和明白反贼们反对中共的原因，能切实关系到他们身上时，首先解决了反贼内部对状况不明产生的过度乐观或悲观（主要是悲观与自暴自弃），为内部提供了理论方向与凝聚力，有了易于理解认知的清晰政治面貌，为政治主动者的奔赴铺好道路。</p>

<p>其次，对多数日子人切实的生活所需，也提供一个真正能解决问题的道路。这样，一旦社会允许公开讨论和流通此类观点，大批经过该主义或思想影响的人，可以迅速连接成一片，不需要再花大量时间等待观点成形，能比其他多数政治观点的持有者，有更快更多的反应时间进行组织，从而获得先发优势。</p>

<p>20.政治运动需有历史运动挂钩进行大规模宣传，获得大众易于理解的政治面貌，例如辛亥革命、五四运动，用最低成本得到法统名义。</p>

<p>考虑到党内老改革派还会有不少人脉与资源，想获得党内老改革派支持，则应该在条件允许的情况下，拥护胡赵邓等人作为当前太子党保守派的对立面，然后再逐渐抛弃邓（这是在多数人不清楚邓在历史里扮演角色的前提下，如果未来发生类似六四事件，且邓被批判，绝不应该拿来当牌坊，相反应该大力推广胡赵，作为从共产党过渡到新政府，却不改变开放与市场化的政治象征，能让人只需要知道我们拥护谁，旧能清晰了解执政风格，降低大众认知成本。）</p>

<p>—– <strong>1880.2</strong> —–2022-12-01 12:04:23+08:00:</p>

<p>我不太喜欢开一个帖子单独发文，因为会引起不必要的争议，猪怕壮嘛，你要想的话可以拿去发，不用署名也没问题。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1880.3</strong> —–2022-12-01 12:28:15+08:00:</p>

<p>1.这个其实很好理解，你想正面打赢一个数百万人的军队体系，这是不可能的。</p>

<p>所以要趋利避害，武装的力量是保持自身不被其他地方势力吞并，可以在地方局部实行行政管控，以及最终在全国林立的势力里成为佼佼者。</p>

<p>军队需要大量的资源供给，如果一个社会连地方行政都控制不了，能让这种民间组织出现，那说明军队也压根没法控制全部局势，可能中央控制的军队还能部署到几个主要城市，但是在此之外的地方就鞭长莫及。</p>

<p>会随着时间发展，迟早变成中央能直接调空的军队地方化，对政治反应不如政府本身快，因为军队开销都需要政府提供，因此有财政权就非常有必要 。</p>

<p>因此情况不是地方发展出一个庞大军队跟数百万人的中共军队战斗取得内战胜利，而是中共先政府失控，对军队管控能力下滑，民间在这种空袭里快速做大，可能一个地方几千几百人的军队，自成一片势力，全国这样的就数不胜数。</p>

<p>在其中还有中央，名义也许没变，但实际能调动的可能就几十万人左右，民间组织建立武装，只要能掌握地方财权，那这些当兵的也要吃饭是不是，就能快速吸纳他们发展壮大。</p>

<p>以武装逼迫和平解放我认为是最佳手段，而不是为了战争而战争，这也是财政权很重要的原因，人家一看你滚雪球速度这么快，你能先发在组织和理论上掌握压倒性武装，对其他潜在的保守主义竞争者是一种很强力的优势。</p>

<p>中央如果陷入威信扫地，对地方财权时空，那除了他们自己提供财政的地区，没有几个能控制得来，甚至如果一些直辖地区因为离北京太远而出问题，那就是光杆司令的概率很大了。</p>

<p>要利用政治局面上的优势，形成多打少，强击弱的局面，中央威信崩溃时，就是快速发展武装组织大鱼吞小鱼的时候，越快可以接手中共在地方的军队和资源，越能快速反过来利用对付中共和保守主义者。</p>

<p>因为社会形态的缘故，实际上我认为很难持续大规模进行内战，上次内战两党都是铺垫了好多年的地方和组织，但现代没有这样的基础，全国在几年内就快速演化然后进行表态是大概率事件。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1880.4</strong> —–2022-12-01 12:39:20+08:00:</p>

<p>2.其实看清零政策就知道，哪怕你什么都不做，经济成果也会被摧毁，而且伤的是骨头，但你什么都不能做，只能承受。</p>

<p>经济发展需要的是更好的制度，对人的更高效率分配，对资源更妥善的使用，而不是具体的死物。</p>

<p>建筑被打坏了，可以生产，我们中国人的经济成果，不是凝聚在那些钢筋混凝土里的，水泥不能代表我们中国的一切，房地产自然也不能。</p>

<p>当然，经济角度上来讲，这肯定会给被房地产经济严重绑架的社会层面带来巨大损失，但反过来讲，也正因为知道这一点，实际如果发生斗争，任何一方都会避免非必要的破坏。</p>

<p>武装冲突肯定会造成经济秩序失衡，但哪怕没有武装冲突，到了中共下台的历史节点，也会失衡，恰巧是因为他们没能力继续推行改革让中国发展到下个阶段，社会已经恶化到宁可经济短期停滞，也要赶走寄生虫，让经济恢复运行。</p>

<p>正是因为要快速恢复发展，才有必要去谈再出发时努力的方向，不是说有武装冲突，就会把深圳上海夷为平地，当代也很难有这么大规模的战争能摧毁庞大的水泥森林。</p>

<p>而是说，我们都知道到时候不可避免的社会动荡迟早要来，经济迟早要出问题，中共会留下巨大权力真空，会有人来摘桃子，既得利益者会想办法换皮上位，这是保有武装的原因之一。</p>

<p>尽快在这种环境里生存，然后获得阶段性成果，就可以更快让产业恢复生产。</p>

<p>就跟癌症要做手术一样，那切开身体割下一块肉来，肯定是有伤害的，但也不得不做，因为它的最终结果是拯救整个社会群体。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1880.5</strong> —–2022-12-01 12:55:10+08:00:</p>

<p>3.现代中国城市化也很多了，但不意味着农村不重要。</p>

<p>农村仍然是许多资源的生产地，城市则是工业与服务类产品的主要生产地。两者是不矛盾的，农村提供广域的物理生存空间，城市能带来足够多的税收。</p>

<p>而因为现代社会的交通基建足够发达，人力反而不是最需要担心的原因，但生存空间却不是，这给农村包围城市仍然提供一定合理基础。</p>

<p>空间就是运动，运动就是生存。</p>

<p>全国一二线加在一起，常住人口也只是全国人口的少数，并且哪怕三四线城市，一个区可能都上百万人，这是过去完全没法比的，反而是农村有的地方人口空了。</p>

<p>所以说，当代很难简单的说是农村包围城市，那是因为当年主要人口聚集在农村，而现代城乡结合部和一些流动人口所在的城市边区，动辄几十万上百万，如果完全不管城市，那显然更不合理。</p>

<p>更合理的做法，是背靠农村的广域空间，作为最容易被针对时的生存依赖。</p>

<p>从城市派人到农村抓人难，从农村到城市找目标却容易很多，这种优势是不该放弃的。</p>

<p>如果能妥善控制好一个城市附近几个区，以及外围的城乡结合部，那这个城市实际已经是瓮中之鳖，最后只剩下那几个核心区，事实上就是被控制住了。</p>

<p>但以上都不意味城市不重要，恰巧是因为城市比当年更重要了，因此才能从城乡结合部逐渐站稳脚跟，只是单纯死板理解农村包围城市，很多人会觉得城市依然不重要，那这就是大错特错。</p>

<p>城市是现代生产的核心根源，大量工厂和运输枢纽交汇，政府有极大量的税源可供使用。反过来因为中国很庞大，如果你只占据部分农村，对付是有城市也有农村，可以通过城市的税源去他们自己的农村领地获得资源，对你形成财政压制。</p>

<p>这也是为什么不能放弃城市的缘故，只不过通常来说，城市的搜捕力度和不安全性都是最大的，所以民间组织往往从偏远地区发展比较容易壮大，而不是不需要城市这块肥肉。</p>

<p>如果有条件，能快速拿下城市，那是自然最好的，但往往困难重重，需要多方巧合或有利因素叠加，比如军队看戏、反应慢，民间组织有足够机会在城市隐藏发展人手，以至于大到能快速瓦解地方政府，可这种事不能有侥幸心理指望自己运气好。</p>

<p>再有就是哪怕拿下城市，也需要资源生产的空间以及退路，农村会始终扮演这个关键角色，否则城市被围困就是被围点打援等死。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1880.6</strong> —–2022-12-01 13:18:28+08:00:</p>

<p>4.无论什么组织，都必须政治化，纯粹的宗教组织，可能说在小范围的地方作乱，因为局势不明朗没人管你，但是没有政治路线，你是一个宗教身份入局，就不可能有机会发展起来。</p>

<p>现代社会的一个好处就是，你可以搞邪教，但是就跟你想称帝一样，社会大众的主流观点是不可能接受你的影响力公开化甚至主导政治，现在不是太平天国的年代了。</p>

<p>就跟黑帮一样，黑帮就是黑帮，宗教组织就是宗教组织，他们一开始对内建立提供的叙事合理性，就是要围绕宗教与非法捞钱这点上，所以当年洪门试图改堂为党实际算失败了，基本都会因为立场问题出现分水岭。</p>

<p>多数组织，他们的目的和存续性是不明确的，我认为很少有组织，从一开始就是为了在全国范围内建立新政权，而这也是纯粹政治性组织的优势，他们会尽一切力量和手段去实现这个目标。</p>

<p>对大部分地方原本存在的组织来讲，地方门阀可能只是想让自己家族能继续吃铁饭碗，财阀希望继续有钱，黑帮打算扩大下地盘，少数民族可能会有地方独立的打算，但如果有人这样做，拿不到全国政权，被人拿到了，最后也会被调头对付，其余的则是只有当利益矛盾严重冲突时，双方才会走到对立面。</p>

<p>那么对纯粹政治组织来讲，唯一目的就是利用好眼前的资源，在大体不违背政治原则的情况下，去实现政治目标。</p>

<p>社会身份也就不那么重要，黑帮可以掌握很多资源，门阀也可能有很多资源，只要政治身份和立场不冲突，就没有必要去刻意对立，他们的威胁只在于双方实力平等或民间组织较弱小的发展早期。</p>

<p>而他们不可能也永远不会控制自身社会属性以外的东西，门阀家族就是靠血亲关系，人就这么点，做不大。黑帮和宗教组织都是见不得光的，只有纯粹的政治组织才能被大众接受作为新政权的代表者，一个能被信服的”政府“。</p>

<p>还有一个不同的地方在于，因为中共搞的这么多年对基层扫荡和控枪，地方黑帮还是门阀，实际的斗争意识都很有限。</p>

<p>有心算无心，早期民间社运还没形成组织，官方可能会找黑帮来滋扰打压。</p>

<p>但是民间组织成型后，是会首先谋求武装自身以及合理使用暴力保护自身的，黑帮还用大砍刀和钢管几十个人当冲锋队吗？可能民间组织已经搞到武装了，我相信为了自卫，到时候反击不会手软。</p>

<p>所以也能看出来，中共压制下的局面，大家一定程度都是绵羊，谁能最快利用这社会动荡后的稳定惯性，快速反应过来变成老虎，抢占一个先发优势，谁就能更快占据有利位置。</p>

<p>黑帮还是地方门阀这些有组织也没用，中共防他们可能不比防民间组织来的少，但是不能靠普通社运不断提高这些群体的阈值，到时候经历多次社运后，中共为了保命放弃地方，连黑帮都配枪了，你社运才想起来搞组织，肯定悔之晚矣。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1882.1</strong> —–2022-11-30 17:10:44+08:00:</p>

<p>江泽民以保守主义的立场入主中央，但是不能以改革派的思维推行革新，一上位就开始抓意识形态，完全倒向保守派，甚至还打算终止改革开放。</p>

<p>占据权位不肯放手，哪怕退休了也要干预朝政前后近二十年，治下的烂摊子一大堆，既没有落实公平社会的改革，也没能推动经济的有效发展，甚至李鹏导致债务超发与经济过热时，江泽民也没有起到一个有效的监督作用。</p>

<p>可以看出，保守派扶持上台的总书记，是不可能也不愿意主动维护改革本身的，他本身更是个用人朝前，不用人朝后的势利眼，如果不是邓小平南巡，江泽民已经成了那个结束改革开放的总书记。</p>

<p>任内吏治几乎可以用糜烂二字形容，完全没有扮演好一个新世纪承前启后的角色，偏偏胡赵时期对社会公平性与腐败问题看重，认为是下个阶段要解决的问题。</p>

<p>结果江泽民主政的时代，社会公平性并没有变得更好，腐败问题还加剧了，官倒的确是没了，但更大的国企侵吞国有资源，左手倒右手的情况接踵而来。</p>

<p>在他治下中国社会问题没有得到解决，相反诞生了许多到今日还存在的问题， 尤其是土地财政和分税制的全面实行，直接影响中国人三代。</p>

<p>这个人的历史评价不会好到哪去，也就是因为后面还有个习近平衬托，并且搭上了经济发展的第一波高峰，但留下的问题，以及首鼠两端的姿态，意图结束改革开放重回计划经济，就注定不应该把他跟现代改革发展的成果联系在一起，更没资格吃改革开放带来的历史评价红利。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1882.2</strong> —–2022-11-30 18:24:47+08:00:</p>

<p>江时期基本都是延续胡赵时期的路线，尤其是多边外交。</p>

<p>多边外交可以说是中国目前外交的基本政策，国内的这一项政策路线，出自赵紫阳在1986年第六届全国人民代表大会第四次会议。</p>

<p>包括85年到联合国大会讲话，84年前后推动的裁军、核裁军，后来的香港谈判以及进入世贸等。</p>

<p>当时外交就是经贸关系为主，六四后经济封锁关系恶化，江泽民是忙着妨碍市场经济发展，妄图开倒车回计划经济再次闭关锁国，被逼着才妥协坐吃红利。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1882.3</strong> —–2022-11-30 18:44:14+08:00:</p>

<p>对中共来说无可避免，但有更好方法处理，而且因为中共的特性，你让他们来处理，结果就只有粗暴和极其粗暴的两种悲剧可选，并非必须要做成的一件事。</p>

<p>气功是由来已久的存在，胡在早年已经给了三不政策，但中共内部有群体自身违背三不政策，甚至主动宣传气功伪科学，导致气功在民间迅速兴起做大，法轮功就是最大受益者。</p>

<p>也就是说一开始不更换政策本身，而不是故意要培养一个庞大的群体，跟着做大了害怕自己被威胁，最后让民众本身承担成本。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1882.4</strong> —–2022-12-01 12:01:16+08:00:</p>

<p>中国外交、经济和内部改革，最艰难的就是八十年代，当时连政府都几乎崩溃，才财政入不敷出，社会大规模动荡，治安高度恶化，没有任何严谨意义上的经济发展可讲，货币更是严重超发，到处都是百废待兴。</p>

<p>对外长期封闭，哪怕毛末期开始转向，也没有一个系统性的体系去接触外交，对苏和解，对美继续深入合作，对日蜜月期，包括引入大量外资进入中国，这都是没有外交展示国内改革所不能有的一面。</p>

<p>有了这些基础后，在全球化市场里竞争胜过印度苏联，国外才意识到中国市场与劳动力的好处。</p>

<p>六四后实际上外交环境算不上困难，美国主动带头解封，放过中共一马，因为中共在南巡后，仍然坚持对外开放与改革，全球市场需要中国，没有八十年代的改革就没有与全球接触的利益交换，外部自然会不需要与中国的经济外交。</p>

<p>而且美国当时还有一种现在看来错误的判断，那就是熊猫派为主，认为中国会随着持续改革开放的经济发展，社会内发生变化，中共的改革派会继续上台，最终促成和平改革，这也是他们愿意主动在六四后破冰继续加深关系的原因。</p>

<p>中国的发展轨迹，包括到现在为止，经济、外交、社会多方面，在八十年代已经定下框架，后续只是沿着这些框架填充，什么时候填满了，什么时候就开倒车，超出这个框架的事是万万没法坐的，中国的改革实际进入两千年后就基本停滞了，江泽民同期，还有赖政府内部主观各项事务的改革派老人们还能把持一些领域，不至于偏差。</p>

<p>这个其实不复杂，就是中共在改革开放后，跟社会基层治安恶化一样，出现的大量权力真空，实际是从文革时期就已经有了，但是延续到比较后期才被大规模注意到。</p>

<p>很多地方公安县志往上查，老是有那种破获什么什么教的信息，包括我在内大部分人都没经历过那个年代，跨度也很大，具体细节很难说，但总结其实不复杂，就是地方没钱管，社会管控不到位，只对大出大入抓紧，警备力量松弛。</p>

<p>法轮功的话我记得是当年直接送光碟，塞门口里的都有，他们能做大还是利用民间迷信风气居多，尤其是农村乡镇，然后借乡镇跳板蔓延到城市。但这个现象隔壁日韩发达国家的发达地区，受教育人士也会遇到这个问题。</p>

<p>所以我想这还是一个很难避免的社会现象，想消灭是不可能的，只需要减少其潜在带来的问题。</p>

<p>那现在的环境，其实就是民间没法自己串联结社，因此过去那种经验缺乏借鉴空间，当年是环境很宽松，政府也管不过来的结果，等全面开始介入了，宗教也好，政治也罢，都很难有空间执行，所以我日常很多时候强调，大环境要中共财政下滑，地方有空间了才行。</p>

<p>南巡是92年，邓小平97年才死，而且陈云95年死了，邓改造后的改革派逐渐上位，市场化已经不可逆，如果邓六四后去世了，江泽民和陈云就会把油门踩到底。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1883.2</strong> —–2022-12-01 03:35:38+08:00:</p>

<p>江泽民本人开明是很多人的错觉，健谈和投机是肯定的，他是计划经济保守派选举的接班人，多数人看到他开明的一面，是基于传统观念里政治严肃氛围下的认知，要说技术发展陈云胡乔木这些人也知道要推进，但究竟掌握在谁手里，谁有话语权，这才是保守的根源。</p>

<p>江胡时代的开明，尤其是江泽民时代，实际只是因为胡赵时期的自由化惯性所导致，社会氛围实际在江任内一直在收紧的，江泽民上位的背景，就是中共党内反自由化的保守派总攻接连取胜。</p>

<p>实际上是完全高估了江泽民，因为你要说个人工作和社交态度，陈云这样的保守派代表人物并不差，姚依林也被赵认为表面和蔼可亲能商量事，但你涉及改革路线和政治立场，就会变得极端保守私。</p>

<p>江执政全程几乎都在政治投机，想尽办法从党中央的体系下尽可能掌握更多权势，只是乐于享受被推到这个位置后的利益，并且想办法将这个利益最大化，是历届领导人里最没志向的一个，也因此是野蛮生长最快的时期。</p>

<p>李锐曾经举荐江泽民，事后江泽民看到李锐装不认识，瞧都不瞧一眼，包括江泽民报复赵紫阳，收缩活动范围加强软禁。所以能看得出，不是江泽民大度，而是社会管控能力有所不及，他主政的年头控制力伸展不到社会的每个角落，因为自由化的风气，其实一直在民间吹着，没人被抓是因为他听不到，大度是相对的。</p>

<p>只不过江泽民主政时期，以六四的保守派军事政变胜利为前提，开始重新收缴权力，自由化和市场化带动的社会氛围也被一点点扼杀，胡温时期也仍在继续，但速度下降了，因为江李是六四的最大得益人和政治支持者。</p>

<p>陈云路线的最终产物就是习近平这样的太子党人接班，而他们典选的过渡技术官僚，用来保证保守派安全的人选，就是江泽民，就像保姆一样。</p>

<p>经济改革不来自于他，他甚至是反对的，在上海是保守派的宠儿，但也因为他是投机的，所以你能看到他鼓励改革的一面，但要让他真正动刀去改革却万万不能，基本做的就是拼命把自己在上海的班底拉起来，然后吃改革派的红利，在中央李鹏甚至都比他坐的稳当，也因为投机主义，党内主体意见往哪发展就自然跟随。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1883.3</strong> —–2022-12-01 19:01:21+08:00:</p>

<p>当时还在世，并且党内资历比江泽民高或同届的有： 田纪云、万里、杜润生、李锐、胡启立、李瑞环 、乔石、 尉健行、任仲夷等。年轻一代后来知名的也有李长春、王岐山这样改变立场的，两人原本都出自胡赵典选的改革派门下。</p>

<p>地位低一点的如杜星垣、姚锡华、杜导正、萧洪达、阎明复、安志文、高尚全、马洪等，虽然退下一线，但都还活着，并且普遍活到了胡温上台。</p>

<p>胡温所属的团派，本身就是邓从胡赵的改革派改组而来，确保政治不变，但市场经济能得到推行。</p>

<p>田纪云和万里原本是入常的地位，南巡讲话尤其是田纪云带头声援支持，万里没入常，但是带头开启改革开放的重要干部，资历跟胡赵接近，铁道部的段君毅活到零几年，退休后还能游走在赵紫阳跟江泽民之间，万里还是江泽民的提拔者之一，汪道涵举荐江泽民，万里同意的。</p>

<p>杜润生敢公开批判江泽民，李锐曾经举荐过江泽民，江泽民是接替原来胡启立的位置，就算政治立场大体接近的李鹏，在中央内部也是瞧不上江泽民的，因为原本总书记位置论资历是被废的胡启立，之后要么李鹏，要么邓力群，江泽民这个人在中央一没资历二没根基跑来插队，纯粹吃六四红利。</p>

<p>哪怕在上海地方比他稍微低点的朱镕基，被中央关注的也更早，本身就是赵安插在上海保守派改革动不了的地方的一个钉子。</p>

<p>上海原本的一把手芮杏文六四后下台还复出工作，江泽民原本只是他副手，更别提年轻一辈已经钦定好结伴的胡温等人。</p>

<p>十四大92年确立了社会市场经济体制，跟邓小平的名字一起写入党章，在党内为市场化提供了法理基础。</p>

<p>十五大97年直接把邓小平理论设为指导思想写入党章，成为党务施政的主要方针。</p>

<p>江泽民是党内一把手，但他一没中央根基，二没威望，他的权力来自于职务，职务来自于邓小平的同意，而不是他上了那个位置就能呼风唤雨，对党内有地位的老人那，最多只能在一些话题上不听不搭理，然后拼命组建自己的小上海帮，给一些保守派的老人们关照好了。</p>

<p>但果江泽民意图结束改革开放，有人就会撕破脸，江泽民就调不动军队，使唤不动国务院，党务工作也无法展开，如果职务真那么好用，华国锋就不会下台了。</p>

<p>以前党内面临的是一个不改革就会亡党的局面，习近平上台后面临的是一个持续改革也会亡党，因此要抓紧权力，首先他的党内法理来源是其出身，因为习近平本身就是陈云红色江山路线的接班人，做什么事在维护四个基本原则上都有天然正确性。</p>

<p>而且现在本身就是陈云路线的胜利，只不过江泽民时期邓的派系影响力还非常大，到胡温时期延续了多年，一直到现在团派被彻底扫地出门才退出舞台。</p>

<p>但市场经济已经是个既定事实，陈云老一代人不信任是因为他们从计划经济时代过来，习近平的新一代则是通过加强国家对经济管控，来达到政治上的安全，这跟陈云时期对市场经济的不满又是另外一回事，即便当时也包括了对市场经济与自由化的捆绑反感。</p>

<p>并且社会层面也是不可逆的，想在国内实行计划经济，和提高政府干预经济的力度是两回事，收缴生产资料会导致无法满足十四亿人所需与生活水平，这个过程本身就会造成极大的社会不稳定。</p>

<p>就像不会无缘无故实行军管一样，只有逼急了才会尝试，但到了军管的这个地步，社会已经必然陷入动荡之中。</p>

<p>习近平在优化国企和政府对经济的控制力度，而不是无限制的扩大，很多地方选择转交给更符合市场经济逻辑的私人企业，然后再通过控制私人企业，以白手套形式扶持垄断市场。</p>

<p>这在不同时代都是有不同方案的，现在邓的派系影响力高度消散，安排走改革路线护航的团派也失势，恰巧经济发展也到头了，赵紫阳留下的经济框架无法再支撑保守派的长期利用。</p>

<p>保守派本身在经济建设上就是吃原初改革派在八十年代提供的老本，中共在九十年代末到两千年时就基本停止了实质性改革，还有少部分在胡温时代才得以推进，随着经济压力增长，保守派自然从自己过去的经历里寻找解决办法，那就是六四和控制经济，这也是近年来政府干预经济增加以及社会管制加强的由来。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1884.1</strong> —–2022-12-01 03:50:19+08:00:</p>

<p>江泽民有不可推卸的责任，扶持习近平这样的太子党上台，本身就是他被选为总书记用于过渡的一个作用。</p>

<p>陈云很早就明确希望红色江山红色子弟，子弟要从第三梯队里选，当时是不够年龄的。</p>

<p>因此六四后选了上海帮等保守派青睐的江泽民，作为一个保姆，以技术性官僚身份接棒，培育第三梯队的红二三代们逐渐壮大。</p>

<p>从历史角度来看，江泽民是个过渡性角色，最终目的是确保陈云路线的成功。</p>

<p>再有就是技术性官僚里也有红二三代，包括团派，刘延东、李源潮等都是大家知道的，为什么选来选去都是红二三代，并且可以确定大环境下太子党可以接班，就是因为第三梯队提拔的太多了，只是这个过程里，江胡目测都动过小心思但都没成功。</p>

<p>突然觉得江泽民好的人可能并不了解他，以及他所代表的政治势力，对中国政治还缺乏一个全面深入的了解，这是很忌讳的，就跟犹太人祭拜祖先，拜到纳粹门下，其实需要个人注意一下，避免闹乌龙。</p>

<p>调侃归调侃，开玩笑打趣，在关键节骨眼不能当真了，平时到没必要说，但当下还是应该讲清楚为什么要注意的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1885.1</strong> —–2022-12-01 04:27:31+08:00:</p>

<p>六四本身最大的推动者就是邓小平本身，他不打算下决武力镇压，没人敢擅自调动军队，江泽民在上海也是保守派的的人，朱镕基反而是被赵紫阳调入上海推动市场化改革，因为江泽民想左右逢源，做事遇问题老找中央。</p>

<p>到六四时江泽民也根本没能力自己调动军队，当时上海对社论收紧有他一份功劳，立场上并没有倾向于自由化，只是比李鹏处理更灵活，也反应了一个问题，哪怕北京的放着不管，也会跟上海一样。</p>

<p>真正问题是邓小平坚决要靠武力镇压解决问题，陈云等人在这件事上跟邓达成一致。甚至四二六社论实际也有让李鹏为镇压决定背锅的成分，李鹏、陈希同等都不愿意挑明邓才是最大推动者这件事。</p>

<p>江泽民能进入中央，是因为在对学运态度上强硬，坚持四个原则，以及陈云等保守派的推荐，在政治上与邓陈等人的需求一致，江泽民有能力调动体制镇压时是毫不手软的，能镇压敢于镇压，是跟保守派相似的最大特点。</p>

<p>意图结束改革开放，扶持太子党（习薄等人）上位，保守派的代言人（保守派即一切反自由化的保守根源）</p>

<p>很多人说的细，我就不赘述了，实际第一条就足够了，他想让中国回到计划经济时代，政治上现在即他所期望，人事上也是他遵从陈云等元老的布局做推手，你会是什么态度？</p>

<p>就试图结束改革开放这一条，对现代中国来说就是天大的罪过。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.2</strong> —–2022-12-01 19:06:34+08:00:</p>

<p>有是肯定会有，但能不能执行，执行了又能到哪个程度，从财政上是看得出状况的，至少目前财政不乐观，疫情类似的社区封控和管制措施，不考虑经济生产本身的损失，单纯是对额外人手的开销，对地方政府来说都是巨大开支，信用分体系可能会被继续推行，如果后续放开的话。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.3</strong> —–2022-12-01 19:09:35+08:00:</p>

<p>每次遇到新状况还是要独立去审视再去判断。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.4</strong> —–2022-12-01 21:26:42+08:00:</p>

<p>经济改革必然带来自由化，邓有清醒认知但不接受该结果，这也是他与陈云在子弟问题上的一个区别，陈云则积极表达通过子弟接班来解决这种未来问题，去维系他们死后的中共政权。</p>

<p>只要能让社会与中共最大效率运作，邓也乐意口头进行政治改革，实则行政改革对系统进行优化，邓的逻辑是问题不许在他接手时出问题，把问题拖延，解决方法交给后人。</p>

<p>经济发展到一定程度，社会也迟早要面临自由化的放开，尤其是对保守派而言，挑战无可避免八十年代赵紫阳主政时期对农村乡镇的资源分配，就是推行地方放权，允许农民经商贸易，有效利用土地，允许符合要求的农民落户到集镇。</p>

<p>并且配套准备咨询和展开一系列对应的政治体制改革方向，都可以反应出经济改革与政治改革是互相驱动，邓针对六四讲话已经说了：” 这场风波迟早要来…是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的，只不过是迟早的问题，大小的问题。而现在来，对我们比较有利。最有利的是，我们有一大批老同志健在，他们经历的风波多 。“</p>

<p>通过邓对香港谈判条件的接受，以及谈话里提及未来五十年后的中国状况，能推断出邓很清楚未来社会发展的矛盾，只是认为爆发在他们这一代更容易处理，对中共生存更有利。</p>

<p>而未来社会经济更发达，自由化和对应的社会改革只增不减，不可能回避，因此以香港为参照物去靠拢，政治问题从而以二次试验田以香港为起点解决来平滑过渡，也是为什么胡温时期对香港选举谈判让步的一个因素。</p>

<p>但是陈云路线胜利后，最终采取的是彻底的封闭，在市场经济背景下走国家资本主义路线，更多的政府干预，更多的政治倒车，主动承担起一个不愿意退出历史舞台的对抗性角色。</p>

<p>其体现特点就是经济制度与地方财权分配的抓紧，这与赵紫阳时期从农民个体到土地解绑，再到允许农民转移到集镇，跟着用集镇做跳板逐渐按社会发展迁入城市的初衷不同，八四年的工作报告指出农民工入城是大势所趋，当时地方放权基本也是配合早期户籍制度改革来进行的。</p>

<p>从而实现个人事实、制度事实与社会生产秩序的紧密配合，但后来政府在户籍改革上基本停滞，地方的土地与分出去的财务权力，通过土地财政和分税制进行置换，转而把未完成的户籍制度作为一种工具，去制造人为的资源稀缺性，从而推高土地价格。</p>

<p>并且在这个基础上，既然满足了分税制后地方财政空缺，又通过分税制下的土地财政与户籍制度，转嫁了中央财政获取优秀税源后的成本问题，只不过最后承担成本的是享受户籍制度的城市人口，以及土地和城市资源都没吃到的农民，同时农民的选择与自留地也更少。</p>

<p>保守派的反自由化不止是文艺和政治表达层面的自由化，而是社会各个阶级话语权的自由化，通过先发优势制造资源落差，再利用落差获取社会的控制权，从而不断巩固先发优势带来的控制力，一直到这个系统撑不住崩溃为止，代价就是全民一起陪葬，换中共多挣扎喘息一些年头。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.5</strong> —–2022-12-02 01:14:34+08:00:</p>

<p>政治权力不是一个刻意变现的指标，权力本身就是社会地位的来源，只有构成的不同，本身权力不会贬值，官倒是因为刚好改革到这节骨眼，有这个窗口才发生，中基层官僚缺乏独立授权的权力，才最喜欢从中捞好处，也就是后来没有官倒也有的腐败问题。</p>

<p>双轨制是一个过渡制度，用过度制度去讨论政治立场和意识形态上的问题来推论变现吗？腐败问题从来都存在，不是一个临时性问题，变现都不是最大问题，而是权力的来源，合法性受自由化浪潮质疑是最要命的，政权再大，大不过一个理。</p>

<p>中共内部根本不回避搞特殊化的，只要不被抓现行当把柄拿捏就当不存在，田纪云就是内部会议上被指出来有亲戚借他身份办事，但陈云搞自己和家族特殊化是没人管的，早期反官倒也是拿来当靶子发泄质疑中共权力来源的话题，方便发表意见，抓住的就是中共默许下的这个理。</p>

<p>对垄断权力这件事本身的阶级来讲，权力只有抓起和放下，邓陈并不是把手中权力待价而沽来寻找一个可以对自身利益最大化的位置，而是根本就跟传统的王朝思维一样，要打江山坐江山。</p>

<p>重点在于，怎么看待要放下权力这件事本身，如果进行民主化的政治改革，是彻底改变政治生态的最底层逻辑，授权的来源从上层变为广大基层阶级，让公权力的来源变得不一样，权力本身是不会贬值的。</p>

<p>权力就是社会地位，重点是来源和法理解释。</p>

<p>这意味着市场化的改革带来经济进步与社会秩序产生变化，民众质问的是你的权力来源，自由化是对解释权力本身来源的大棒在谁手里的一个开端，而不是权力贬值，哪怕公民选举出来的总书记，也始终是总书记。</p>

<p>这也是为什么后来赵紫阳意识到，社会制度与生产方式的改革，带来的经济进步，必然会推动政治制度变革，是你的生产方式结构变化，带来了所需的政治制度变化，两者是有先后关系的。</p>

<p>并且彼此之间是绑定高度相关，党内元老很多人清楚这点，所以才有反自由化的审查，我前面说的很清楚了，就是基于这一点邓陈在政治上才保持一致，但是党内邓这样的人又很清楚只要市场经济改革，必然会有质疑公权力来源的浪潮。</p>

<p>而不是我做了会贬值所以我不想做，实际是权力本身不会贬值，但老一辈更不愿意放下自己建立政权和争夺来的权力，思维本身对比现代人就停留在一个落后的阶段，彻头彻尾威权主义者。</p>

<p>最后一段我看完也是不晓谓何言，前面已经讲很清楚了，农民个人生产带动早期改革开放的经济流通，从而促进更大规模的经济体运作，逐渐在农村集镇从计划经济的僵硬里活化整个社会，它是与社会的迁徙自由、生产自由紧密相连的，农民进城反应的是城市的经济活动开始大规模增加。</p>

<p>那什么又叫做”反自由化能和结束改开扯上关系 “？你自己都说没错了。</p>

<p>自由化是改革开放的必然产物，也必然导致权力的法理来源会受质疑，而不是说两者是独立不相关的事物，因为包括邓等人在内自己都很清楚，不存在既想要改革开放又不想让自由化出现保住垄断权力这种好事。</p>

<p>区别是，陈本身就更喜欢鸟笼经济，也不喜欢自由化，暗自反对邓的全面市场化，如果能结束改开的同时还能解决自由化浪潮，就会去做，只是失败妥协了。邓则是坚持全面市场化，能意识到自由化不可避免，但问题交给后人解决，唯独不许在他们这一辈人发生。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.6</strong> —–2022-12-02 01:39:45+08:00:</p>

<p>中共内部论资排辈的情况让地位高的老党员有发言权，内部脱离了政治体制，自成一个人脉圈子。</p>

<p>而中共是从建政到九十年代末，已经差不多半个世纪，实际上江泽民那一代，很多人就已经是红二三代，他们之间过去几十年的家族和私人交往，甚至互相联姻，那圈子可就大很多了，你看李锐就有点被排挤了，合群很重要，一些老党员以长辈身份给党内一些人写信也是有影响的，习近平不就跟李锐谈过么。</p>

<p>当总书记不是当皇帝，的确权力大了可以用人朝前不用人朝后，甚至很多家族未必有人在朝内当官或地位很高，可是资历是都有的，总书记也需要靠拢其他人的意见，建制化下一定程度是职位带来权力，但人情社会里人脉和集体的支持也是权力的重要来源。</p>

<p>尤其是陈云订的路线，在这个圈子内部可以算不成文的规矩，是符合集体利益的，那些元老的子女们，可能有的人不当官，没公开职务，但私下可能就能找好几个中央委员交流，这些人还得很客气。</p>

<p>习近平本身是八十年代的干部预备役，到02年他父亲去世，都二十多年了，已经是中生代干部，江泽民跟这些老人肯定都有走动，他不一定是为了单独照顾谁，而是集体意志下作用的产物，来来去去这么一群人，按照性格跟私人关系再选，红二代身份肯定是最瞩目的，李鹏曾庆红这些不都是红二代么，他们早就开始上位了，再有就是要等未来档案解密才能确定，但现在已有观点指习近平本身也是妥协产物这件事。</p>

<p>自己的利益争取不到，就按规矩保守办事，规矩就是党内成文的和圈子内不成文的规矩，具体操作细节要等更多信息解密，如果中共还保有内部比较私密的对话文档的话，但这种东西外人其实是不太好还原过程了。</p>

<p>【 我说的已经很清楚了，江的改开才是邓的改开，赵的改开是走不通的。如果要先改政体，甚至妄想同时进行经济改革和政体改革 】</p>

<p>江泽民在政治上遵循了保守派的初衷，不让自由化出现在他们这一代人，这也是邓的初衷，但是延伸下去邓陈两人对未来社会的预期是完全不同的。</p>

<p>首先赵紫阳在当时的政治改革，背后主要推手就是邓小平，并且邓小平追寻的是行政改革，用来优化制度本身。</p>

<p>所以你说这个赵的改开走不通，槽点我就懒得说，给赵紫阳政治改革背书的那个人就叫做邓小平，那到底是邓小平走不通？</p>

<p>赵紫阳哪怕后续对政治改革有了进一步的认识，前提也是先进行经济改革，然后才会出现不得不进行政治改革的需求，两人在政治改革上本身就没有巨大矛盾，只是后来赵紫阳认为要改的更彻底以适应社会发展。</p>

<p>邓要求的很简单，要求总书记立场坚定，不允许也不接受民间的政治风波在他们这一代人还活着时出现。</p>

<p>但他并没有完全堵死未来社会的路，香港的改革开绿灯就是在他活着时的结果，并且继承他观念的胡温也的确老实执行了。</p>

<p>香港占中的起因就是因为习近平上台后给的政治改革方案，跟胡温给的，邓小平背书的核心理念不同。</p>

<p>政治上的最终延续和倾向，江习是延续陈的路线，胡温延续的是邓的路线。</p>

<p>【 转换到西式民主制度，就一定会对现有权力进行洗牌，经济乱象伴随政治乱象还怎么有序改革？ 】</p>

<p>政治改革是经济改革的产物这一点赵紫阳当时就已经有认知了，伴随的不是权力洗牌，而是权力的抓放问题，邓不愿意接受中共放权下台这件事本身，他可以允许政治改革来放权，但必须在他和中共最高层控制下。</p>

<p>而且，哪里还有经济乱象？恰巧是因为经济需求达到了，但还是缺乏有效监督。</p>

<p>赵紫阳下台时，政治改革没有跟邓小平发生分歧，下台是因为跟胡耀邦一样，在压制自由化上表态不坚决，邓看在眼里很不放心认为政治不可靠。</p>

<p>89年时，赵紫阳希望实行的政治改革是保持共产党的优势领导地位，而不是西化议会制，这一点他跟邓的步调是保持一致的，邓也是他政治改革的支持者，后来赵紫阳被软禁后，随着经济发展，继续演化他的政治改革观点。</p>

<p>89年元旦有人借经济问题攻击改革，邓特地给他站台来支持改革，包括当时赵紫阳希望实行的政治改革具体，到十三大后还明确提出了许多工作细节。</p>

<p>邓小平在六四之前的表态是：首先是党政分开，解决党如何领导和善于领导的问题，这是关键。第二， 是权力下放，解决中央和地方的关系问题，同时地方各级也有一个下放权力的问题。</p>

<p>【 作为党内权力者，为了维护自身利益一定会同时进行对民主制度的扭曲和对自身权力的变现。公民选举总书记，和现在党内晋升路径完全是两种玩法。意味着所有人政治地位都不再明确，唯有转化为资本产权才是确确实实的权力根基，一定会导致恐慌性权力变现。 】</p>

<p>必须明确再说一次，权力对中共高层是个只有抓和放的问题，不是一种可变现的指标，他们根本不关心能变现多少钱，而是纯粹的政治观念和行为差异。</p>

<p>邓小平在六四前是支持对地方放权分权的，他们不需要有什么恐慌性权力变现，变现成什么？因为选举所以要尽快捞钱吗？</p>

<p>他们就是非常单纯骨子里的打江山坐江山思维，必须要保证共产党的领导地位，一个威权体系打算放权时，就已经表明这些权力不是待价而沽的东西。</p>

<p>权力本身就是一个垄断产物，不动摇统治的根基和权力就是一种维护统治的手段，这也是反对西式民主的原因，为什么还要变现一个垄断产物？</p>

<p>【 至于你说的什么屁民的权力，农民工进城，户籍制度，都不是邓关注的资产阶级自由化的核心问题。自己再读一遍四项基本原则，不要给改革开放想当然的添加自己的幻想。 】</p>

<p>如果不了解陌生事物和超纲话题，建议可以读一下相关内容，邓赵对改革开放都有清晰的认知，就是会伴随经济改革，必然出现政治改革和自由化的声浪。</p>

<p>之前花了那么多篇幅去描述因果逻辑，起码得看一眼吧。</p>

<p>他们知道经济改革的本质是对地方和企业、个人下放权力。</p>

<p>个人在当时对应的主体是农民，这种权力进一步的放宽就是解绑毛泽东时期的地区严格限制迁徙自由，允许农民得到更多迁徙自由，从而填充经济改革里迫切需求的劳动力这一环节。</p>

<p>邓自己在86年都说： <strong>现在不搞政治体制改革，不能适应形势；政治体制改革应作为改革的一个标志；其他所有的改革能否取得成功，决定于政治体制的改革。</strong></p>

<p>只是区别在于，邓反对资产阶级自由化和西化民主，他追求的是行政改革。</p>

<p>这一点跟继承陈云路线的江泽民、习近平是完全不同的。</p>

<p>你说不是核心问题，邓小平现在出来自己跟你说是核心问题，政治改革直接决定其他所有改革能否取得成功，难道要跟他说道说道？</p>

<p>【 再强调一遍邓的思路叫改革开放，赵的思路叫资产阶级自由化，江实践的是改革开放，并没有结束改开，改开本身就是反资产阶级自由化的。 】</p>

<p>谈改革开放和八十年代党内分歧的一个基本入门认知。</p>

<p>赵紫阳在当时跟邓小平没有政治改革上的明确分歧，赵紫阳对议会制和西化的思考是下台以后赋闲在家，伴随经济发展后的新思考。</p>

<p>江泽民的思路不是改革开放，而是陈云的政治路线。</p>

<p>只不过邓小平反对的自由化在政治立场上与陈云利益一致，短期内形成了一个重叠。</p>

<p>更长远发展邓小平追求的是中央地方放权，只不过在民间自由化浪潮来了以后开始保守，开始更在乎中共权力地位和集权程度，便不再去谈政治改革，认为这会威胁到他们。</p>

<p>赵紫阳当时的政治改革思想他后来总结过，大体如下，多数经过邓支持和首肯的：</p>

<p>增加党和国家决策的透明度 。</p>

<p>开辟各种对话渠道。要同社会各个方面，各种力量，各个利益集团对 话。重大问题一定要和各个社会集团协商对话，不是只在共产党内作出决定。</p>

<p>要改变选举制度，扩大民主选举的范围，扩大差额选举的范围。当时还设想，甚至包括共产党向人大提名领导人的时候，可以同时提出几个候选人 ， 由人大代表从中选择。</p>

<p>切实保障公民的权利， 结社、集会、游行、请愿、罢工都应该有具体 的法律。</p>

<p>有领导、有限度地开放舆论 。</p>

<p>原话是：</p>

<p>总之当时设想，在共产党继续保持执政地位的情况下，如何能够更好地容纳社会的政治参与。社会上各个方面，各种利益集团，尤其是知识分子的政治参与。我们虽不实行多党制，但要尽量地容纳和扩大其他各种力量的政治参与。</p>

<p>这些想法有的已见诸文字或谈话，更多地已经写进十三大的政治报告，当然有些不能写得那样明确，有些当时还不能写进去。这就是1986-1989那几年我对政治体制改革逐渐形成的概念，即执政的地位不变，执政的方式必须改变。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>这些内容里，有的东西能写进十三大意味着什么？意味着邓小平过目了，他也知道并且同意。那何来赵紫阳是资产阶级自由化？？</p>

<p>那上述这些叫不叫资产阶级自由化的产物？大家都不是傻子，都清楚这样的改革最终导向什么结果。</p>

<p>邓的反资产阶级自由化，是背靠社会主义背景下的政治产物，他以前有反右的政治包袱，所以有政治反右的惯性，他不能既要用右派的市场改革，又去反右，尤其是他有反右包袱前提下，还自我批判了。</p>

<p>又不能不去平反，不可能只平反左派，因此这里又压着拨乱反正这件事。</p>

<p>所以他知道自己要走右派的市场经济改革，但是政治上要反对避免被人抓话柄立不住权威，自己就出来先反对资产阶级自由化，在自己活着的时候不允许这种情况波及到自己，但又留个尾巴允许香港跟胡温谈。</p>

<p>江泽民有没有实践邓小平追求的放权，以及十三大政治改革里的目标？没有。</p>

<p>胡温呢？部分尝试了，但是党内根本拧不过弯，给香港开绿灯，没几年就没保守派拧过来了。</p>

<p>邓小平的保守和政治落后是有后续负面影响的，但没有明确的派系惯性，江泽民和习近平的派系立场，来自于陈云而不是邓小平。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.9</strong> —–2022-12-02 13:39:28+08:00:</p>

<p>字太多恐你不乐见，我尽量简短说一下。</p>

<p>赵紫阳在当时跟邓小平没有政治改革上的巨大分歧，你说赵紫阳的思路是资产阶级自由化，这个就错了，想来这也该是基本的吧。</p>

<p>相反赵紫阳早期对政治体系没有太多深入思考，他对政治改革的观点很多都来自于实际经济建设时遇到的问题，然按照邓小平的要求在十三大坐了报告总结。</p>

<p>八六学潮有个背景，人民公社在82-84年解体，实际上也是有类似双轨制问题，反而导致很多农民适应不了，这个背景下学运也就不止是学生了，但因为农民没话语权，所以记录很少，也很少有人注意到。</p>

<p>邓小平八七年谈话的态度是： <strong>改革是全面的改革，包括经济体制改革、政治体制改革和相应的其他各个领域的改革。</strong></p>

<p>为什么要从农村开始：</p>

<p> 我们的<strong>改革和开放是从经济方面开始的</strong>，<strong>首先又是从农村开始的</strong>。<strong>为什么要从农村开始呢？因为农村人口占我国人口的百分之八十，农村不稳定，整个政治局势就不稳定</strong>，农民没有摆脱贫困，就是我国没有摆脱贫困。</p>

<p>党的十一届三中全会以后决定进行农村改革，<strong>给农民自主权，给基层自主权</strong>，这样一下子就把农民的积极性调动起来了，把基层的积极性调动起来了</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>户籍改革是生产改革的下一阶段，赵紫阳在全面接手政治改革前就注意到了，但邓没分歧并且大力支持，跟陈云保守派拉扯的主要就是基层放权、企业放权、地方放权的情况。</p>

<p>也就是说，农村生产改革→经济改革→政治改革，如果顺利，下个阶段应该是经济生产发展到一定阶段，进行农民的户籍改革，然后带动新一轮的改革，你该想下是否有精准正确的认知。</p>

<p>但是江泽民卡死在这个阶段，邓小平希望推行的地方分权，最后变成分税制。</p>

<p>对农业户籍改革，江泽民当年有个叫“逐步解决我国二元经济社会结构问题”的讲话，但实际上没有真正去推动，除了六四后的短暂政治靠拢，邓本人死后改革开放有哪一条是坚持八十年代改革初衷的？</p>

<p>邓喊不能资产阶级自由化，是不让自己反右的背景成为政治包袱无法推行右派的市场经济，免得成为自己权力和政治路线的绊脚石，而不是说改革开放这件事本身，是伴随反资产阶级自由化而来的，反资产阶级自由化里个人立场对邓影响很大。</p>

<p>胡温继承邓的路线，第一个就是跟资产阶级自由化做妥协，企业话语权最大的年代，对香港这种左派观念里的中国资本主义大本营更是政治妥协。</p>

<p>而陈云左派反资产阶级自由化，则主要是派系和集体立场矛盾，江习是继承这个立场的。</p>

<p>【 我也懒得说了， 邓看中赵是因为他在经济工作做的好。也同意他配套经济改革进行政治改革 】</p>

<p>谈改革开放背景的一个常识，你我都应该知道赵紫阳原本不负责政治改革，也不怎么关心政治上的事，对吧？</p>

<p>并且你我都应该知道，邓小平才是主抓政治改革的人，这是他改革开放所希望达成的一部分，只不过赵紫阳之前是胡耀邦来负责。</p>

<p>【 你自以为重要的农民权力什么的 】</p>

<p>邓的原话是什么，你能解释一下吗？</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> 我们的<strong>改革和开放是从经济方面开始的</strong>，<strong>首先又是从农村开始的</strong>。**为什么要从农村开始呢？**因为农村人口占我国人口的百分之八十，<strong>农村不稳定，整个政治局势就不稳定</strong>，农民没有摆脱贫困，就是我国没有摆脱贫困。</p>

  <p>党的十一届三中全会以后决定进行农村改革，<strong>给农民自主权，给基层自主权</strong>，这样一下子就把农民的积极性调动起来了，把基层的积极性调动起来了</p>
</blockquote>

<p>那么何来是你以为的我自以为？</p>

<p>请问我是邓小平吗？</p>

<p>【 唯独四项基本原则不能改，这才是赵下台的原因。 】</p>

<p>赵紫阳下台是因为对镇压学潮不支持，立场不够坚定，跟胡耀邦一样。</p>

<p>他在任内改革时，跟邓的观点都是一条线上的，就是中共领导地位不变下的政治改革和发展，就算党内有声音批判赵紫阳，也只是说他在四项基本原则上不够坚定，没拿出总书记的表率。</p>

<p>你直接跳跃到要改掉，那你从哪里得到这个信息的？有没有对改革开发史和这段矛盾岁月的大概认知？</p>

<p>【 这就属于断章取义了。这里邓后半段就强调了，不能大改。改革的方向是要让党领导做最后的决定权，而不是亲自指挥亲自部署。从来没有你后文提到的所谓，“赵紫阳的改革方法，邓也同意的论调”，邓从来就不同意。 】</p>

<p>实际上看这段我就大概明白什么情况了。</p>

<p>第一，搞不清楚赵紫阳的政治改革到底是改革什么。</p>

<p>第二，也不清楚赵紫阳政治改革的发起者和把关人就是邓小平本身。</p>

<p>第三，更不知道赵紫阳与邓小平在十三大的政治改革上是磨合很久，并且到最后是因为六四的原因放弃了当下政治改革的打算。</p>

<p>【 邓的放权不是赵的放权，邓一直强调要坚持党的领导，要保持中央的权威。 】</p>

<p>你要是不了解就去学习，我前面至少有好几次明确告诉过你。</p>

<p>赵紫阳压根就没有放弃过中共的领导地位。</p>

<p>你言下之意难道是赵紫阳要放弃中共的领导地位去走西式民主的道路吗？</p>

<p>【 我说过了，赵任何不违背邓的四项基本原则的经济，政治改革邓都可以同意，就像你东扯西扯的那些细枝末节，邓根本不在意。至于什么是反资产阶级自由化我前文已经说了，就不再赘述。 】</p>

<p>因为赵紫阳压根就没有违背四项基本原则，政治改革也没有说要违背四项基本原则打打算。</p>

<p>只是忤逆了邓小平的意思，不愿意坚持镇压做表率替邓办事。</p>

<p>你具体也说不出赵紫阳有什么问题和路线差异，这也是你一直回避的地方。</p>

<p>我用那么多字详细说完，你自己来个不赘述，到底是你发现说不出来，还是你发现自己到半天最后是错误的？</p>

<p>【 这是错误的，邓的放权是对基层放权，让村民自治，也就是放开对农民的束缚，让村办企业，人口流动可以活起来。从来没有你说的希望推行地方分权的意思。 】</p>

<p>首先必须给你科普一下什么叫放权。</p>

<p>计划经济时代，经济生产和销售权力基本被垄断在体制决策内。</p>

<p>这意味着当时政治=生产权，两者是一回事，基层是什么基层？基层就是中央到省级，省级到市，市再到乡镇。</p>

<p>中央允许省级解绑，省级下面几十个城市要负责解绑，城市下面几百个上千个乡镇要逐一解绑。</p>

<p>好家伙，让你一句话都给简化的，搁着糊弄谁呢，我逐段审的目的是什么？是让你把这么重要的话题，按照这离谱的结论给掩盖过去吗。</p>

<p>你说生产权力都被垄断的计划经济制度下，给多少权力才能让近十亿人的国家几十年都不许做的事，突然开始可以了，并且还让几个亿人口的阶层弄自由流动？</p>

<p>这是不需要说就应该明白的基本道理，那你都不懂….我想不出有什么合理解释。</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>为什么要从农村开始呢？因为农村人口占我国人口的百分之八十</p>
</blockquote>

<p>你是中国人吧？那你看中文解释下什么叫“为什么要从农村开始？”，这个要从…开始，那之后应该去哪？。</p>

<p>80%人口又到底是多少亿，你有这个基本概念吗？</p>

<p>80%人口的迁徙权和生产权解绑，要通过多少地方政府？</p>

<p>中央直接负责这80%人口吗？还是说，放权给地方让他们按照中央的路线自行决策？</p>

<p>【 邓对赵后期的中央权威丧失很不满意，而分税制才是符合邓构想的改革。保证了中央对地方的统筹规划，财政分配的能力。</p>

<p>邓的意思很明白，就是民主集中制。可以民主，但一定要集中，最终决定权不在民主，而在于党的领导。</p>

<p>中央对地方要有权威，党对政府要有权威，上级政府对下级政府要有权威。 】</p>

<p>中央始终有威信，陈云和邓小平都是中央，他们说话地方就要听，赵紫阳负责中枢统筹，并且通过土地财政来为地方带来新活力，邓小平之前提了快十年的放权简政，后面同意分税制也是基于六四后的政治保守趋势。</p>

<p>再有就是，邓胡赵万等人推动的改革开放，明确的一条路线就是中央只负责抓大方向，要钱没有，要政策可以给。</p>

<p>具体去看一下任仲夷、赵紫阳、万里在地方改革的经验，改革开发也从来没真正丧失过什么权威性，难道你那个位面改革开放跟我们的不一样？</p>

<p>莫不成，你到现在还不清晰的观点，实际就是赵紫阳要搞西式民主，然后搞成了中央没威信？</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.12</strong> —–2022-12-03 12:04:36+08:00:</p>

<p>【 我们在讨论的是自由化，改开的关键。 你内涵的观点就是反自由化就是反改开。而我的观点是邓的改开包含了反自由化。 】</p>

<p>改革开放是不包含反自由化这件事的，因为改革开放本身就不是邓一个人的东西。</p>

<p>邓小平反自由化是基于他的政治包袱。</p>

<p>他和胡赵能清晰意识到，市场改革必然带来自由化，但是邓小平早年反右。</p>

<p>市场化是右派的路线，他不能同时既要当婊子还要立牌坊，反自由化是他的个人利益，而不是改革开放的个人利益。</p>

<p>改革开放不是邓一个人的东西，你说邓的改开，这个最基本的就错了。</p>

<p>并且为什么说你基础从根上就错了，哪怕是邓的改开，他反自由化也只是基于个人角度，而不是跟陈云一样有自由化就要反，他一切反自由化是确保不影响个人，这也是为什么他允许香港这种资产阶级自由化的大本营保留选举的可能。</p>

<p>后续他隔代指定的胡温也如实质性，反而是陈云路线的习近平直接违背邓当初给的承诺。</p>

<p>简单来说，改革开放里的资产阶级自由化在邓的观念里是迟早的事，因此六四九月间军官才说迟早都要来，我们老人都在来了比较好，然后提及五十年后的事。</p>

<p>所以这就是你搞不明白的一点，改革开放是一个整体的过程，邓是华国锋、陈云里，唯一一个坚持会导致资产阶级自由化的右派市场路线的人。</p>

<p>反自由化一个是毛主义在党内是天条，这个背景下必须强调政治正确。第二个就是个人利益，反右是他的政治污点，是没法解释的，如果完全否定反右，会直接把他跟文革后的一系列拨乱反正脱钩，所以反右只说过扩了。</p>

<p>前面就问过你了，邓如果要求整个改革开放都反自由化，那为什么还要执行注定资产阶级自由化的右派市场经济？甚至还留了个底子，让香港作为大本营去允许选举制度的改革。</p>

<p>也即是说，邓小平不接受他手上出问题，但能清晰认知未来迟早要变天，所以六四后仍然维持了香港的原定计划，并且他的路线被隔代指定的胡温执行，直到被陈云路线的习近平推翻。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.13</strong> —–2022-12-03 12:21:02+08:00:</p>

<p>【 问题的关键在于自由化。 至于你说的农村问题，对于改开来说是很关键，但对于自由化问题一点也不关键。完全就是主抓经济的改革，我实在是一点都不明白你一直往这上面扯有什么意义？怎么个重要法？ 】</p>

<p>因为说到现在我才发现你都没明白经济与自由化的关系是什么。</p>

<p>什么叫自由化？资产阶级自由化，社会主义是没有自由化的。</p>

<p>以前的生产都是定死的，只有资本主义的“资产阶级”才按照市场经济的套路去灵活销售。</p>

<p>那现在邓在党内想宣传的话，我们学习他们，但是我们还是社会主义没变味，资产阶级坐不了江山，那是不是就该反资产阶级自由化了？</p>

<p>也就是说，违背计划经济，允许农民以社会主义市场经济的名号，进行名左实右的市场经济生产时，这就是自由化，但政治上不能承认。</p>

<p>区别时邓小平不管自己叫资产阶级。</p>

<p>邓提出的反资产阶级自由化，就是坚定中共的社会主义法理，无论你事实上已经变成市场化，抛弃共产党的身份，但嘴巴上也不变，管这玩意叫社会主义市场经济。</p>

<p>自由化的本质就是允许资产、生产的配置自由化，必然产生的阶级，你反对的却只是阶级的自由化，而不是导致阶级出现的原因，甚至还大力推广他。</p>

<p>所以就说为什么你没明白改革开放本身是天然自带自由化的。</p>

<p>反资产阶级自由化是一个政治指标，解绑人力和产业允许市场经济，这才是资产阶级诞生的基础。</p>

<p>经济搞不明白，政治就无法理解为什么出现变化。</p>

<p>就像举个例子，纳粹改革开放用犹太人的制度，做犹太人做的事，以犹太人习惯生活，原本犹太人是被管制的，你现在允许他们恢复活动自由，这就是自由化。</p>

<p>然后还要对内保持纳粹的传统，说没改初心，我们要坚定反对犹太阶级的自由化。</p>

<p>那还在坚持用犹太人的东西，又为了自身的法理，要立反资产阶级自由化，避免犹太人做大。</p>

<p>自己在希特勒时期反犹太厉害，政治包袱太重的，任内不许犹太人做大，但留了一个犹太人特区，还给了他们选举的承诺，并且让后续自己继承者去办这件事，这叫邓小平。</p>

<p>不反对改革开放，但是反对走犹太人制度和文化，主张取消集中营制度，但反对放宽隔离审查，并且坚定认为不能给犹太人权力的，这叫陈云。</p>

<p>【 农村的改革就是要搞活经济，我说了经济的事邓是支持赵的改革的，经济配套的政治改革也是支持的。但关键问题是出在自由化上。 】</p>

<p>有一些槽点我都懒得说了，你前面说懒得说，我跟你讲，我更懒得说也不愿意说，但反复强调好几次也不带管的，不得不说。前面就明确提到了政治局势和为什么要从农村开始改革。</p>

<p>农村允许生产活动，就会出现资产阶级，也即是自由化。</p>

<p>资产阶级自由化不是一群资产阶级被允许自由化了。</p>

<p>而是从控制死死的生产秩序，到自由化的生产秩序，这个副作用就是会有一批有钱人做大，然后在社会上逐渐有话语权，中共很清楚。</p>

<p>并且我说了很多次，这个你也错了很多次。</p>

<p>赵紫阳跟邓小平在政治改革上，当时没有巨大分歧，两个人都认为要保留中共的领导地位，邓允许的政治改革在现在看来，哪怕只是行政改革也是很进步的，他的问题在于六四宁愿杀人留下长期祸患和社会问题，也不愿意自己手里砸了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.15</strong> —–2022-12-03 13:00:46+08:00:</p>

<p>【 邓对体制改革的态度是】</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>进行政治体制改革的目的，总的来讲是要消除官僚主义，发展社会主义民主，调动人民和基层单位的积极性。要通过改革，处理好法治和人治的关系，处理好党和政府的关系。党的领导是不能动摇的，但党要善于领导，党政需要分开，这个问题要提上议事日程。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>什么叫党政分开？自己心里没数吗？就这种地方你该自己看清楚，老让别人说好么。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【邓支持放权，邓支持分权吗？】</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>我的中心意思是，中央要有权威。改革要成功，就必须有领导有秩序地进行。没有这一条，就是乱哄哄，各行其是，怎么行呢？不能搞“你有政策我有对策”，不能搞违背中央政策的“对策”，这话讲了几年了。党中央、国务院没有权威，局势就控制不住</p>
</blockquote>

<p>您有没有一个基本认知，改革开放是怎么起来的？</p>

<p>改革开放最早就是给地方分权，允许地方按照当地需求搞政策，我都说好几遍了。</p>

<p>还在这问支不支持地方分权，不支持经济特区怎么来的？</p>

<p>你知不知道邓小平说这段话是在说什么，背景又是什么？</p>

<p>你自己引用肯定也看到全文了。</p>

<p>下面就有一句：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>我赞成边改革、边治理环境整顿秩序。要创造良好的环境，使改革能够顺利进行。</p>

  <p>中央定了措施，各地各部门就要坚决执行，不但要迅速，而且要很有力，否则就治理不下来。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>邓小平到底在说什么？</p>

<p>你不清楚背景我给你科普一下，说的就是，当时大背景下，毛的计划经济制度还是很深入人心，哪怕到八八年计划经济也还是有很多占比。</p>

<p>各省份生产还是路径依赖，习惯老一套规矩，对中央推行的市场经济改革反应慢，甚至反应消极，达不到改革所需的指标。</p>

<p>并且反应最消极的就是内地省份和老工业省份。</p>

<p>所以邓说：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  沿海地区要加快对外开放，使这个拥有两亿人口的广大地带较快地先发展起来，从而带动内地更好地发展，这是一个事关大局的问题，内地要顾全这个大局。 反过来，发展到一定的时候，又要求沿海拿出更多力量来帮助内地发展，这也是个大局。那时沿海也要服从这个大局。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>为什么强调中央，是你认为的市场化后各地就翅膀硬了吗？</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>这一切，如果没有中央的权威，就办不到。各顾各，相互打架，相互拆台，统一不起来。谁能统一？中央！中央就是党中央、国务院。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>不是，而是地方抛弃计划经济慢了，对市场经济拥抱慢了。</p>

<p>当时一个大背景，就是所有地方都是计划经济改革过来的，但有的地方传统很重，而且还有保守派的人反对市场经济，这一切强调都是在反对计划经济，而不是说市场经济下有人做大不听话。</p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>我们要定一个方针，就是要在中央统一领导下深化改革。</p>

  <p>过去我们是穷管，现在不同了，是走向小康社会的宏观管理。不能再搬用过去困难时期那些方法了。现在中央说话，中央行使权力，是在大的问题上，在方向问题上。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>因为以前是穷管，中央也管不过来，现在市场经济改革，中央要亲自去监督你们这群计划经济路径依赖的省份来完成市场化改革。</p>

<p>也就是说，包括南巡在内，只有人不遵从市场化改革的路线，才有必要处理地方问题。</p>

<p>你看最后邓小平说的全段是什么？</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> 宏观管理要体现在中央说话能够算数。这几年我们走的路子是对的，现在是总结经验的时候。如果不放，经济发展能搞出今天这样一个规模来吗？</p>

  <p>我们讲中央权威，宏观控制，深化综合改革，都是在这样的新的条件下提出来的。过去我们是穷管，现在不同了，是走向小康社会的宏观管理。不能再搬用过去困难时期那些方法了。现在中央说话，中央行使权力，是在大的问题上，在方向问题上。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>中央直管宏观调控和大方向上，地方自己要在遵从这个市场化改革不可逆的道路上，自己想办法摸索出道路。</p>

<p>还有一点，你必须知道，当时是党政企不分家。</p>

<p>整个分权放权的过程，就是把这三者分开。</p>

<p>党政分家说了很多次了，政企分家，你以为是现在这样的企业关系吗？国企那就是政府的一部分延伸。</p>

<p>赵紫阳十三届三中全会报告怎么说的：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>一是进一步推动<strong>政企分开</strong>，使有条件的企业真正放开经营。目前严重影响企业活力的，主要是：应该下放给企业的权力被部门或地方截留；各种各样的行政性公司或中间环节对企业进行种种限制或盘剥；四面八方对企业的摊派名目繁多。为了改变这种状况，给企业造成更好的外部环境，关键是实行彻底的政企分开。</p>

  <p>　这里有一个极其重要的问题，就是能否正确处理局部利益同整体利益的关系。近几年来，中央把<strong>一部分权力下放给地方</strong>，调动了地方的积极性，这是正确的。今后，中央仍将尊重和照顾地方的利益。但是，<strong>应当属于中央的权力，必须集中，不得分散和削弱。</strong>各地区、各部门，都有责任维护和服从国家的整体利益。这种局部利益同整体利益之间的关系，不能模糊，更不允许颠倒。在治理经济环境过程中，尤其要注意这一点。全国的经济环境是一个整体。中央财政过不去，全国日子都不好过。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>所以从一开始改革时，中央就一直是抓紧文革后松散的权力，而不是放开，这一切都是在中央抓权的前提下才进行的。</p>

<p>那个时候中央和地方的关系就处于良性发展，而不是地方在分税制后，被当作牛马驱使，恰巧也反应出后来的保守派无法通过压制以外的手段，跟地方保持一个良好发展的互动关系。</p>

<p>你还要记得，赵紫阳当时是面临党内大量保守派反攻的，这些保守派在各省各部门，那就是这些矛盾的来源。</p>

<p>还有关键民生议题上，保守派或者过于松散怠慢的地方首长如果处理不力，怎么办理？</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>在粮食调度这个重大问题上，务请地方同志以大局为重，支持中央。如果出现拒绝中央统一调度的无组织无纪律行为，<strong>唯省委书记和省长是问</strong>。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>中央的放权是允许地方的决策权在大方向上运作，分权是把党政和政企拆分。</p>

<p>企业是拆分出来了，党政就没能完全落实。</p>

<p>为什么中央要一个劲督地方，因为他们已经把大部分经济权力下放到地方，如果保守派不干活，那就是与中央步调不一致。</p>

<p>所以你自己就仔细看完环境再细品邓说的是什么：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>不能搞违背中央政策的“对策”</strong>，这话讲了几年了。党中央、国务院没有权威，局势就控制不住。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这是说什么？说的是保守派计划经济那批人不肯配合市场改革，在里面使坏，有陈云支持敢跟邓赵的市场路线唱反调。</p>

<p>赵紫阳怎么评价党内这群人的：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>当时<strong>李鹏他们主持国务院工作</strong>，在治理整顿的名义下，<strong>把已经下放的权力又收回来，把过去搞活的 一些措施、政策又重新搞死</strong>。一切都向着<strong>与改革开放相反的方向扭转</strong>，使已经改革了的经济体制，又大大地倒退了一步。</p>

<p>所以邓是坚定支持市场化改革，你看到的一切，你以为的一切，这个背景都是在戳保守派脊梁骨。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.16</strong> —–2022-12-03 13:47:01+08:00:</p>

<p>【 邓放权放的是事权，不是党的领导权力。邓讲究的是全国一盘棋，中央统筹规划。中央没钱，拿什么规划？放开民主选举，放开舆论上的政治正确，怎么保证党的领导四项基本原则的实施？】</p>

<p>放事权就不叫放权，必须是放中共领导地位才叫放权？</p>

<p>我前面已经跟你说了，邓小平当时的政治改革，是行政改革，并且包括赵紫阳在内，都没有打算让中共失去领导地位。</p>

<p>我上面也跟你说了，统筹全国的基础背景，是计划经济下保守派的们在地方不听话搞事开倒车，导致地方消极的情况。</p>

<p>都表达完了，然后你重复一次好像发现新大陆，那我之前说的你看没看，看了能不能理解。</p>

<p>什么又叫放开民主选举？政治改革就是一下子全民普选了？？？你以为这是赵紫阳的路线？还是胡耀邦的路线？？到底有没有了解过他们具体的改革措施和细节？</p>

<p>中央要求的是财政平衡和调度，怎么实现对民众的领导，就是靠经济发展和政治清明，邓小平才追求政治改革，以及市场化在全国推行。</p>

<p>要是张嘴闭嘴，只会复读机说必须保证中共的绝对领导，四项基本原则是客观规律，那叫陈云和习近平路线。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>【什么是自由化，就是反对党的第一性。赵和邓根源性分歧就在于这一点。 党的领导的三个关键点，中组部，中宣部和中央财权。搞民主就是在削中组部。搞新闻自由就是在削中宣部。搞包税搞到中央财政跌倒20%，就是在削弱中央财政。</p>

<p>胡耀邦搞人民主人翁论宣扬民主，借助乱象批邓的精神污染论。胡下了赵上来他怎么说？】</p>

<p>第一你不了解具体赵紫阳和胡耀邦路线，上来就说民主选举，那谁要民主选举，有没有政治联系和实际的工作报告？这是完全脱离实际情况的，作风民主跟实际执行的民主制度是两回事，别看到民主两个字就PTSD。</p>

<p>第二，搞民主在党内都是被允许的，毛泽东说他们是新民主主义阶段，邓也同意，民主是个概念，党内没民主，为什么要搞集体意见和中顾委，对比毛时代，邓时代就是更民主了。</p>

<p>什么是党的第一性？这是一个共产主义政党，以社会主义抓紧经济的计划经济为核心，这就是政党的原初目的，控制生产来达到意识形态和政治目标。</p>

<p>市场化这件事本身就等同于允许资产阶级与生产的自由化，邓小平他是老年痴呆了不清楚吗？</p>

<p>你完全忽略了一个大背景，胡赵执行的政策，都是邓默许或者了解后允许的，最后出分歧是因为学潮逼到了眼前，让邓有危机感。</p>

<p>搞全民的民主选举这根本就是民间要求，胡赵是作风民主，但始终是党内工作原则为主要，你不能拿出来张冠李戴。</p>

<p>最幼稚的一个地方，就是压根没搞明白，一切能拿出来的工作报告，都是经过邓和内部审查过后的产物。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>赵紫阳在政府工作报告里的话是什么意思：</p>

  <p>任何时候，决不允许借口反对资产阶级自由化而压制民主，决不允许抵制甚至打击对实际工作缺点、错误的正当批评。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这是政府工作报告，邓要过目，你难道幻想赵紫阳有能力一手遮天吗？只要能说出来的，代表政府的，都是政府和党内的看法。</p>

<p>那问题来了，邓小平的嫡系胡耀邦，脑子抽风了来公然唱反调？邓小平86年因为胡耀邦访谈的问题打算把他换下来，胡耀邦都没察觉还兴高采烈跟邓谈话，这里起码还是已经有邓对胡的单方面不满。</p>

<p>那过去这些年，邓难道也傻了吗，放任一个自己的嫡系公开反对自己好几年？</p>

<p>胡耀邦对胡乔木的 《关于新闻工作的党性和“人民性”问题》 可是高度赞同的，他自己也说了” 增强党性，就是我们全党同志首先是党员干部都要全心全意地为人民服务 “，文内解决的其实就是党性与人民性孰高的问题。</p>

<p>所以说你对历史人物的政治路线和基本作风都缺乏了解，利益关系没有基本概念的话，根本无法理解一些你认为合理，实际放到现实深究细辩站不住脚的情况一戳就倒。</p>

<p>【 还什么对学潮的镇压不及时。学潮的本质是什么？学生的诉求是什么？学生追求的理想政府是什么？打着谁的名义谁的口号？ 】</p>

<p>你基本因果关系搞明白了吗？</p>

<p>学潮是不是胡耀邦或赵紫阳主导发起的？如果不是，那作为总书记，他们的问题也就跟学潮的主导性在谁不发生关系。</p>

<p>所以你的意思是胡赵利用这些东西发起政治冲击，去挑战中央权威对吧，要不然我无法理解怎么可能有人一点常识都没有，居然说胡耀邦搁着批判邓小平。</p>

<p>因为这种基本逻辑都过不了关，直接把邓小平当背景NPC来满足于观点的做法，让我实在是很难理解，假设是真的，连你都能反应过来，难道邓小平是大脑宕机思考很久才回过味吗？</p>

<p>最基本的两点，你对八六学潮和八九学潮有没有具体认知。</p>

<p>来自民间的学生肯定是希望西式或者说至少大刀阔斧改革。</p>

<p>但压根就不意味着双方一开始就是绝对对立，胡耀邦甚至可以去派人跟学生接洽对话，党内邓小平在大规模学潮爆发前的早期，看到民间有要求，也主动带头出来说要求政治改革。</p>

<p>八六年谈话已经说的很清楚了：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>设立许多公司，实际是官办机构，用公司的形式把放给下面的权又收了上来。机构多、人多，就找事情干，就抓住权不放，下边搞不活，企业没有积极性了。</p>

  <p>1980年就提出政治体制改革，但没有具体化，现在应该提到日程上来。不然的话，机构庞大，人浮于事，官僚主义，拖拖拉拉，互相扯皮，你这边往下放权，他那边往上收权，必然会阻碍经济体制改革，拖经济发展的后腿。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>再顺带提一个之前要讲的：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>权力不下放，企业没有自主权，也就没有责任，搞得好坏都是上面负责。全部由上面包起来，怎么能搞好工作，调动积极性？总之，改革要继续进行下去。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>赵紫阳在八六学潮后当时的观点是：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>中国实行对外开放后，过去跟外界没有多少接触的学生缺少判断是非的能力，看到美国和日本更发达，有些人便得出错误的结论，主张中国应当全盘西化，不理解这在国情十分不同的中国是不可能的。</p>

  <p>赵紫阳承认一些学生得出这种结论不足为怪，因为在1978年以前社会主义制度确实有一些失误。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>邓的观点其实很明确了：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“我们的改革的主要目标，是保证行政机构的工作效率，不受外界太多的干涉……在民主的问题上不要感情用事……民主只是手段，民主应该同法制结合在一起。只有依靠法律，我们才能有一个稳定的环境。”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>只有党性还有四个基本原则的绝对路线居然还要讲法？？？</p>

<p>这就是为什么我吐槽有的人陈云和邓小平路线分不清。</p>

<p>邓小平时代对整个流程说的也很清楚，部分还是发生在学潮大规模出现前，也就是看到早期动向了，中央就知道应该改了，但是学潮又让邓小平的PTSD犯了。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1986年6月28日，邓小平在政治局常委会议上指示说，在筹备将于一年后召开的十三大时，中央书记处必须制定一个计划，用一年时间研究政治体制改革，然后提出行动纲领。他提醒说，“不搞政治体制改革，经济体制改革也搞不通。”他的部下要在1987年7月拿出文件初稿，在8月或9月召开的七中全会上进行讨论，以便最后一稿能在10月的中共十三大上公布。</p>

  <p>赵紫阳根据邓小平的指示，在1986年9月中旬成立了“中央政治体制改革研讨小组”，成员有胡启立、田纪云、薄一波和彭冲。这个小组配备了一班人马，下设政治体制改革办公室，赵紫阳给政治局常委邓小平、陈云、李先念和胡耀邦写信提出了人选名单。按邓小平的指示，他在信中阐述了政治体制改革的目标：为现代化服务，为长治久安提供保障。鲍彤被任命为政改办主任，他在1980年由中组部派去为赵紫阳工作。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>八六到八九学潮，都不是优先以要打倒邓小平或共产党为目标，赵紫阳还一度被误会成是斗倒胡耀邦好自己上位的奸臣，大众印象里的政治面貌跟李鹏一样。</p>

<p>【 中央要是有威信还需要赵紫阳在政府报告哭穷？学生还能去冲击新华门？还需要邓小平后来去南巡？ 】</p>

<p>所以建议不了解就去学习，别想当然。</p>

<p>地方哭求就管中央要更多信贷指标和财政支持，我前面说了，不知道你在看什么，当时是中央赤字养着，有的省份吃饭不干事，赵紫阳马上出来说要严惩，后来经济过热不稳定，陈云要求财政平滑，就转向财政平衡。</p>

<p>赵紫阳在政府报告里哭穷有什么用，中央的合法收入原本就不够，而且你一政府存钱干什么？等通胀？所以不清楚你这些理解都是什么角度得出的结论。</p>

<p>现在中央政府有没有威信？民间社运还是反贼一样搞你，所以你关联学运这就是逻辑缺失，生活在一个这样的年代，刚发生完的事，怎么想都不想就说出来。</p>

<p>最离谱的槽点是邓小平南巡。</p>

<p>邓小平南巡是因为江泽民主政后，开始遵循提拔举荐他的陈云路线，因为邓小平不负责前台具体执行改革，前台的人如果不遵循他的意思，要么换掉，要么恫吓。</p>

<p>很多自己压根都不了解当时政治环境，也不去仔细学习串联知识，得出一个违背客观事实的结论，学者、政府报告、官媒和当事人群都在客观陈述一个已经发生的事，但就总会有现代人管中窥豹盲人摸象，得出莫名其妙的结论。</p>

<p>邓小平全退以后，中央工作就是江泽民李鹏负责，他们都是典型的开倒车名士，所以我有时候很难理解，凭借有限认知觉得是地方不听话才需要邓小平出来南巡，到底有没有了解过。</p>

<p>就比如下面这段：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>这是老领导的个人威信，是中央威信吗？陈云邓小平死了呢？</p>
</blockquote>

<p>谈改革开放基础的一个认知，大家都知道陈云邓小平都不负责前台具体执行吧？</p>

<p>胡赵还是后来的江李，他们都负起草方案、政策和执行，八十年代早期邓小平还会主动出来管一些事，后来年纪大了，就只负责在家里或会议上听报告看结果再给决定。</p>

<p>邓小平和陈云就是中央的最大领导，胡耀邦、赵紫阳这些都是中央的组成和施政人员。</p>

<p>你自己强行拆分的依据在哪，有没有合理的解释。</p>

<p>中共内部是个论资排辈的体制，建制化是从胡耀邦这代才开始的，对这些老人不管用，资历老，关系网大，威望高，那就是老大。</p>

<p>就好比到底是毛泽东担任中央首长才有权力，还是他本身威望就够高了才有权力？</p>

<p>对老人来讲，他们的地位和威望高到一定程度，是不需要具体职务来体现的，全退以后邓小平一个普通党员身份，凭什么政府要为党务作接待？这就是区别。</p>

<p>什么是中央，你能不能自己问问自己。</p>

<p>中央概念又是从什么时代才开始被具体建制化的。</p>

<p>你回答不出来不要紧，我替你回答。</p>

<p>中央就是党内威望权力最高的人所在，陈云在党内发言仅次于邓小平，邓小平也允许有不同意见，但如果重大议题要拍板，陈云也必须闭嘴支持。</p>

<p>中央的具体概念就是从胡耀邦时代被建制化，绑定最具体职务上，到了江泽民时期老人全退下来，才逐渐落成的，老人都去世了，谁也不高出谁好几个层次。</p>

<p>邓小平死了，为什么江泽民还不敢反水？</p>

<p>原因很简单，第一大趋势已经定下来了，社会已经不可逆发展。</p>

<p>第二，江泽民依赖的是职务，而不是个人党内地位和威望，资历比他老的更多，职务低不代表发言权少，这里相当部分都是邓的人支持市场化。</p>

<p>第三，江泽民本身就是投机主义者，无所谓具体路线，开倒车试图结束改革开放，是因为陈云那面的因素，陈云死的比邓小平还早，更不需要在意，只不过陈云的红色江山红色子弟路线，他也是护航者。</p>

<p>在里面掺水再多，他没威望翻台子，换届也必须老实交权，就算再干预，总书记还得是胡锦涛，到胡第二任期江的影响力就更弱了，驽马恋栈也是要有基础的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.21</strong> —–2022-12-03 23:36:26+08:00:</p>

<p>前面就说了，你不看我打字，因为我之前解释过了，万一我要是在回复里塞一句骂你的话，你都不带知道的，这就是为什么我才是最难绷住那个你懂吗？我从前面就很认真的给你在讲解了，你还在这带着情绪有什么意义。</p>

<p>自由化问题很简单了，我再重复一次。</p>

<p>什么是自由化，自由化不是一个阶级的自由化，而是生产方式的自由化，在政治上的表述是资产阶级自由化，因为生产方式自由化带来的资本累积决定了这一结果。</p>

<p>生产方式带来阶级，市场化意味着生产方式的改变，也就会出现社会意义上的贫富差距。</p>

<p>所以建国时社会主义为核心的指导思想是收缴生产资料，所有人都失去了生产自由，这是计划经济的一个大前提。</p>

<p>改革开放实现的就是生产自由化，也就是经济自由化，经济是一个没有现实主体的概念，不对应到具体个人，因此可以套用社会主义市场制度，在社会主义下解释其法理合法性。</p>

<p>邓等人的描述就是，社会主义也可以搞市场经济。</p>

<p>但是市场化产生的资产阶级，在政治上不被允许重新占据主体地位，阶级意味着存在具体的个人或对象，是政治实体，也即会有主观意志去行动。</p>

<p>因此才不能让资产阶级自由化，不能让这一生产方式所出现的族群获得社会话语权，在政治上堵死任何可能。</p>

<p>邓小平和陈云的共同点是，他们都反对自由化，并且都明白市场经济必然会带来资产阶级。</p>

<p>区别是，陈云反对的是包括资产阶级诞生的市场经济本身，没有生产自由，自然没有资产阶级的存在。</p>

<p>而邓小平在知道会带来资产阶级的前提下，坚定走市场经济道路，但是不允许在他这一代执政时进行自由化，却允许资产阶级的存在和壮大，因此才把香港选举留给胡温。</p>

<p>农民获得了生产自由与迁徙自由，决定了他们重新获得生产资料，代表着资产的累积与传统语境下资产阶级的诞生。</p>

<p>万元户按毛时代的语境，那就是妥妥的资产阶级，不是走资派哪里来的钱，你自己想一下，改革开放为什么要允许香港这个资产阶级自由化的大本营最终会有选举，以及允许资产阶级出现。</p>

<p>邓个人的原因说的很清楚了，邓小平反右有政治历史包袱，放不下来。</p>

<p>也即是说，集体进行的改革开放，包括华国锋、陈云、邓小平三人都支持的这件事里。</p>

<p>是有政治和路线分歧的，邓小平所希望的改革开放，是指中共占据领导地位，中共进行护航，允许资产阶级存在，实行市场经济的一个“共产党”。</p>

<p>但是不排斥在未来随发展，顺应时代进行改变，但是他执政时不允许发生这种事来挑战自己权威，因为邓的反右直接牵扯到他的地位问题，资产阶级自由化等于要他政治生涯完蛋。</p>

<p>而邓小平的思路更接近新加坡，政府抓紧法律的武器，保留放权的状态，作为一种工具让社会清明，从而维护中共的领导地位。</p>

<p>只不过两次学潮，让邓的危机感大增，因此宁可选择政治紧缩保守，但还是给未来留了一条路，允许通过香港作为制度的试验田，所以才有香港选举的承诺，以及胡温按照邓的路线执行这件事。</p>

<p>所以也就不存在什么邓的改革开放本身就是反自由化，反自由化的是邓本人在执政时的政治需要，改革开放本身是不反自由化的，胡温时代是香回归后港跟大陆关系最好，社会主义下，资产阶级发展最迅速的年代。</p>

<p>后来陈云路线胜利，习近平上台，停滞了一切邓对未来的改革预期。中共当时政策，包括四项基本原则是基于党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，而不是说最终路线，邓说未来五十年和六七十年抓紧发展和四项基本原则，都有一个贴近的时间段就可以知道他的预期是什么了。</p>

<p>其实我跟你说再多，不如问你一句，为什么保留资产阶级自由化大本营香港的选举承诺，以及胡温作为邓的继承者，还如实履行了，就这一点你表达的前面都站不住，只是你不会接话茬会当不存在而已，我都体验过几次了。</p>

<p>你一句“ 别在这扯淡了，扯一大堆一句有用的没有 ”，只会显得你自己有问题，我是很认真讨论的。</p>

<p>自由化与什么伴生？你不懂。我让你也反驳我，装死。</p>

<p>两个基础你都不明白，你搁着跟我表演什么呢，合着你就会几个名词是吧。</p>

<p>【 中国现在的政治正确是邓的改开，写入党章的是邓的思想。 】</p>

<p>别搁着政治正确了，该跟上版本了，现在的政治正确是习近平新时代社会主义思想。</p>

<p>也就是以习近平为核心的红色江山红色子弟，这是陈云的路线。</p>

<p>邓小平跟陈云等左派妥协，你看过邓的理论内容吗？</p>

<p>强调改革也是一场革命，也是解放生产力，是中国现代化的必经之路，僵化停滞是没有出路的，邓小平死后九十年代末到两千年初就抛弃了。</p>

<p>邓的理论核心是强调国企为主导部分，然后国企就大下岗，并且改革停滞，除了胡温时期有部分缺乏实质性的推动外，到习近平时代干脆开倒车。</p>

<p>邓的理论还有部分来自赵紫阳强调的公平社会论，现在有吗？贫富差距和保护劳工有吗？</p>

<p>难道你是六四被冷冻到最近，才给解冻的冰冻人。</p>

<p>【 你要想发明新理论欢迎你，但别给邓和江硬按上你自己的思想然后又批判一番。 】</p>

<p>我陈述事实而已，你不接受就算了，居然给我戴高帽，认为是我发明的。</p>

<p>批判的是你啊，江泽民就是个没能力也没立场的投机小人，邓小平坚持市场改革，不允许自己在时出问题，经济路线跟陈云尿不到一个壶里，这是众人皆知的。</p>

<p>还需要我批判，请问我批判什么了。</p>

<p>【 我说邓提倡的是民主集中制，搞民主制度动摇党的领导，你给一步推进到全民普选，二极管？ 】</p>

<p>【 为什么要中央有权威，是让赵有自己的权威，赵的班子有自己的权威。这样才能改革下去，没有邓给赵的改革撑腰，他算个老几？ 】</p>

<p>没有邓给赵撑腰，老四呗，邓陈胡赵。</p>

<p>你有没有基本中共改革开放政治史观？还在这问老几，嫌别人抓你话柄不够多吗。</p>

<p>改革开放正式开启前，最初是邓陈跟华国锋有路线之争，再到后来陈云跟邓有路线之争。</p>

<p>赵紫阳在地方的四川经验，跟万里一起为市场改革打下事实基础，让邓在中央有资本挺直了腰板，因为有资格说要走的路线是可以带来经济增长与生活水平提高的。</p>

<p>胡耀邦则提供理论和党内人事基础，拨乱反正直接带来了巨大的党内理论优势。</p>

<p>你说说赵紫阳是老几？</p>

<p>【 结果赵改革改的忘了本，中组中宣财政一个抓不住，还要他邓来撑腰。 】</p>

<p>你是不是发表暴论前不会去查一下？嘴巴要说证据又拿不出来，常识又没有。</p>

<p>国务院总理管哪门子中组部？</p>

<p>中组部改革开放早期是胡耀邦担当部长，之后是老乡宋任穷，再然后是陈野苹、乔石、尉健行，基本都是胡这面的人，归中委会负责。</p>

<p>人事变动胡都长期给赵开绿灯，用后脚跟想一下赵紫阳为什么说胡锦涛和温家宝是他们提拔的人，农研的人让你吃了？朱镕基怎么到上海的。</p>

<p>中宣部又让你发明抓不住了？除了邓力群王忍之这些是党内老左派推上去的，不算胡耀邦本身也是中宣部部长，王任重、朱厚泽你是不是不认识是谁的人？</p>

<p>还抓不住，陈云怎么三个都抓不住，还不如赵紫阳是吧。党内有几个婆婆啊？</p>

<p>财政到你这又抓不住了，看我之前回复，扫了一眼就现学现卖是吧，地方到中央哭穷，我记得你好像是说成赵紫阳哭穷了，有意思。</p>

<p>【 你非把中央权威和邓的权威混为一谈。邓批的既是各省，又是中央。 】</p>

<p>没有邓的权威，就是中央的权威，党内谁最大谁就是权威。</p>

<p>没建制化的政权，名字就是一切，毛泽东和邓不担任任何职务，都不怕没有权力，也不怕中央没权威，因为他们就是权威本身。</p>

<p>当然，你不懂什么叫建制化，跟你解释你是不会去理解的，油盐不进的一个人。</p>

<p>大背景是人都知道，老左派陈云在地方有威望，可以绕过许多人，直接靠关系网去跟中基层表达观点，有独立于邓的沟通渠道，邓陈是党内最高层保持不分裂，老大是邓，但不代表陈就只能听之任之。</p>

<p>邓的讲话全都是基于陈云等左派在党内抵触市场改革的前提，邓也不是毛，要尊重党内左派意见，他干的事背身就是违背祖制，所以才提了政治不能自由化，以及社会主义也可以搞市场经济的两大发明。</p>

<p>我大概分析一下，你是先按照自己理解，去定义一个描述，除此之外的背景、实际情况都不需要考虑，也就是说你只认你希望看到的字面意思。</p>

<p>所以你说：“ 搬的邓的话我反驳的自由化定义 ”，我就知道你什么情况。</p>

<p>因为你不会去问，为什么我说自由化有其他定义，因为你根本没能力延伸拓展讨论，你自己本身是不懂的。</p>

<p>我说，犬有很多称呼，比如狗和汪星人。</p>

<p>其次，我们搞个问答，我一个人扮演你和我两个角色，我替你安排下什么是合理的交流。</p>

<p>首先，我说，自由化是什么。</p>

<p>你问，自由化是什么？</p>

<p>我说，传统语境里的自由化，就是资产阶级自由化。</p>

<p>你问，难道还有更深层的意思？</p>

<p>我说，那没有资产阶级的社会主义里哪里来的资产阶级，必须搞清楚这个问题进行溯源，对不对？</p>

<p>你说，没错，资产阶级的确是突然冒出来的，从哪出现的呢？</p>

<p>我说，计划经济下，生产秩序是大体统一被控制的，没有经济自由可言，因此无法累积出资产阶级的存在。</p>

<p>你说，那按道理也不该有才对，没有经济自由就没有资产阶级的存在，何来的资产阶级自由？</p>

<p>我说，是这样，但是现在改革开放，允许市场化和经济自由化。</p>

<p>你说，那一定会导致资产阶级的复现和崛起。</p>

<p>我说，没错，是这样的，所以经济改革导致了资产阶级的复现与自由化，资产阶级首先要存在，才能有自由化的前提，而存在本身是与经济改革天然伴生的。</p>

<p>你说，原来如此。</p>

<p>结束。</p>

<p>这就是正常交流。</p>

<p>真实交流是什么样的呢？</p>

<p>我说，自由化是什么？</p>

<p>你说，反自由化是邓小平针对资产阶级自由化提出的一系列巴拉巴拉巴拉。</p>

<p>我说，那自由化具体意味着什么，在什么背景下形成，溯源从哪开始？</p>

<p>你说，反自由化是邓小平针对资产阶级自由化提出的一系列巴拉巴拉巴拉。</p>

<p>我说，反自由化是一个对资产阶级出现的体现，主体是资产阶级，那么资产阶级从何而来。</p>

<p>你说，反自由化是邓小平针对资产阶级自由化提出的一系列巴拉巴拉巴拉。</p>

<p>所以我吐槽你阅读能力有问题，真的不是说我跟你对线的一种贬损。</p>

<p>而是真的我认为你有很大问题才说出来，降低沟通成本你懂吗？</p>

<p>当然还有一种情况，就可能是心理牛逼哄哄，唉，我就是不听你的，你说什么都没用，我就是不服你，哎就是玩。</p>

<p>但没人要你这样，只要求你讲道理，实事求是，但如果真的超出你能力，我也很无可奈何，因为我想的那么多其实都只是多余的，可能真的就是你能力仅此而已，是我对你要求过高了，当然这也是我不愿意看到的最无聊的一个结局。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.27</strong> —–2022-12-04 01:48:43+08:00:</p>

<p>你仔细认真的看你这里是不是有阅读理解问题？我真没冤枉你。</p>

<p>前面说的是不是权力贬值和变现的问题，我明确说了，不存在这两种现象，公权力就是公权力，权力本身是不会贬值的，对中共来说，只有抓和放两个情况，不存在寻求变现途径，皇帝不需要变现自己权力，权力可以直接获得资源。</p>

<p>这就是为什么我吐槽你前面的地方，这是对权力的认知观问题。</p>

<p>然后回归正题，我说的是“ <strong>哪怕</strong>公民选举<strong>出来的总书记，也始终是总书记</strong> ”</p>

<p>所以我用的是<strong>哪怕</strong>！！阅读理解能不能清晰一些？</p>

<p>它强调的主体，不是改革开放本身的政治改革，而是强调公权力不会因为来源的变化而贬值，前面的核心要点在于“ <strong>民众质问的是你的权力来源</strong>”</p>

<p>更前面的则是强调改革开放与资产阶级自由化的伴生关系，“ <strong>市场化的改革带来经济进步与社会秩序产生变化</strong> ”</p>

<p>邓和赵紫阳，尤其是你想暗示明示都好像是在说赵紫阳要做民主选举的政治改革，就根本没这回事。</p>

<p>你没看明白我说的是什么，自己到后面还说 <strong>公民选举总书记 和 放开民主选举</strong> 。</p>

<p>然而我前面强调的是公权力不会因来源贬值，而不是应不应该实行，以及是不是有政治改革里打算实行这一条。</p>

<p>所以你跟我说“ 公民选举总书记，和现在党内晋升路径完全是两种玩法。 ”</p>

<p>没人要这么做OK？哪怕，什么叫哪怕，这已经是很脱离原本路线的做法了。</p>

<p>为什么我用“哪怕”，因为中共当时政治改革就根本没打算走这条路线，所以才用的哪怕，它不是一个原本的合理预期。</p>

<p>但是你后面直接接驳理解成了，有人要在政治改革里进行公民选举。</p>

<p>说明什么，一个是阅读理解有问题，另一个是实锤你对这些事的了解，很多都是现学现卖从我这里吸收了解然后再返过来。</p>

<p>你这句话：“ <strong>放开民主选举，放开舆论上的政治正确，怎么保证党的领导四项基本原则的实施</strong>？ ”</p>

<p>一，政治改革草案里不是要搞民主选举，</p>

<p>二，你回复的主体是什么，必须是有一个合理前提你才能说出这句话的。</p>

<p>三，你一开始就理解错的东西，当成理所当然给接下去了，实际反应的就是你心中默认的答案，哪怕跟实际不贴边。</p>

<p>以上不难理解。</p>

<p><strong>为什么我说的是哪怕？你自己却接成了既定事实？</strong></p>

<p>因为我知道赵紫阳和邓小平当时都妹打算走这个路线，但你默认成是赵紫阳搞乱了的既定事实。</p>

<p>更别提这种：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>中组部，中宣部和中央财权。搞民主就是在削中组部。搞新闻自由就是在削中宣部。搞包税搞到中央财政跌倒20%，就是在削弱中央财政。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>对中共、政府和当时历史相抵触的言论。（改革不放权搞经济，难道要集中全力搞计划经济？计划经济时代抓的到很紧，邓小平敢杀人保证政权，都懂的要坚持放权这个道理。）</p>

<p>谁那么喜欢集中权力？毛左！或者自诩明白共产主义，内里实际心怀帝制的共产主义cosplay魔怔人?这种人不是互联网和现实都最不受待见的吗？</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.29</strong> —–2022-12-05 19:17:17+08:00:</p>

<p>看邓的做法要理解邓的利益所在，他的观念大体总结下来是三个要点。</p>

<p>1.坚持中共执政，不能有动摇，尤其是他这一代。</p>

<p>2.承认资产阶级会随改革开放而存在，且会逐渐壮大，所以要在政治上控制和反对。</p>

<p>3.接受未来发生客观变化的可能，这个变化应该尽一切可能遵从第一点，但不以牺牲改革开放本身为代价去遵从第一点。</p>

<p>很多人认为第一二点是不兼容的，这就是为什么有人容易钻死胡同。</p>

<p>首先邓虽然反对三权分立和西式民主，但也不希望走毛时代的老路，所以他追求政治改革主要是行政上的改革，强调法治，允许社会有不同声音和批判，只不过不允许动摇总路线，如果参考的话可能在对法律运用上类似新加坡。（但新加坡还是有选举的）</p>

<p>其次邓有政治包袱，改革开放的两大基础，真理大讨论和市场经济，一个是党内理论基础，一个是实干经济成就。</p>

<p>真理大讨论推动的拨乱反正，本质就是在反毛的制度，但邓小平自己在毛手下反右的债没法还。</p>

<p>举个通俗易懂的例子，就是一个前集中营管理掌权后，开始说否定纳粹的种族主义政策，你要是干净的还好，但你亲自坐实了大量事件，哪怕清算不到你头上，也会导致你说什么话没说服力，缺乏政治上的法理依据。</p>

<p>如果邓不反自由化，会导致他曾经斗过的右派这件事，成为攻击改革开放和他个人立场的一个有力话柄。</p>

<p>所以他必须保持前后一致，要不然你前面反右，后面又开始纵容资产阶级自由化，你有什么威信去推广改革开放，说服党内的左派认你当老大？</p>

<p>当然，哪怕没这个包袱，邓小平也是反自由化和西式民主的，但这个就是个人价值观喜恶，而不是政治利益上的需求。</p>

<p>因此有政治利益上的考虑和需求，在资产阶级自由化的道路上，他可以一定程度的睁一只眼闭一只眼，直到两次学潮让他有危机感，政治层面才开始收紧保守起来，原先的行政改革内容也收紧不少。</p>

<p>如果没学潮或其他事件，邓可能没那么多危机感，一些比现在开明但又不至于全面自由化的改革政策，可能就会被落实，学潮让邓的危机感产生后意识到不能这么搞，会让自己政治上靠不住，也会让共产党统治不稳。</p>

<p>早期改革开放民间已经有自由化的情况，邓虽然不负责一线工作，但也是知道的，左派的人来告状，邓除了部分时候需作为党魁站出来表态，遇到一些不要紧的都睁一只眼闭一只眼和稀泥，偶尔加强一下左派，但更多还是推动胡赵落实改革开放。</p>

<p>经济开放和政治保守其实是不可以兼得的，邓显然想试一试，所以见干部才表达大概说，迟早都要来，我们这一代来比较好的这种观点，但他未必能判断清楚应该拿捏的程度。</p>

<p>从邓的个人视角，他的政治和身份利益有两条。</p>

<p>第一条，共产党出身，他不能背弃自己的出身，这是他政治生命的利益所在，这也是为什么必须政治保守，确保共产党的地位。</p>

<p>第二条，改革开放，这是区别于其他共产党派系的一个路线，也是他个人的政治利益，脱离于共产党本身了（陈云等人为首的共产党），却又必须以共产党的身份去施行，没有改革开放，他就那么高的历史地位，无法离开共产党身份。</p>

<p>所以就造成了政治保守，经济开放这种看似互相矛盾的局面。</p>

<p>导致邓小平的做法，卡死在一个身份与立场矛盾的过程当中，反资产阶级自由化，政治个人利益是为了反右包袱，确保在其他共产党面前站得住脚有威信。</p>

<p>对党内计划经济制度的集体交代，就是说虽然我们搞市场化，但是政治上我们还是一贯不变的。</p>

<p>这样既保证党内政治上说得过去，也能让邓小平自己没留下话柄被陈云拿来说。（大体意思你可以想“看，我反右了但我没双标，市场改革我们共产党也可以，并且我也不允许资产阶级自由化”，这就有了政治保证。）</p>

<p>哪怕不考虑邓小平个人反感资产阶级自由化带来的一切制度变革，在政治上支持资产阶级自由化，都会面临一个问题。（他个人就是不喜欢的，这个没什么好说的，但一个成年人，个人喜恶和个人利益可以完全分开。）</p>

<p>那就是一旦他支持自由化了，当初反右的那个邓小平又算什么？所以邓反自由化是个人喜恶和政治利益叠加的结果，个人喜恶可以默许一些灰色地带，但政治利益受学潮冲击后，马上就提高了攻击性。</p>

<p>就像初代教父说我们要洗白家族上岸，但是我们不抛弃西西里人的生活方式一样。</p>

<p>邓因为有反右的包袱，导致一个对他个人来说的发展死局。（共产党党魁和改革开放都是他个人终极的政治利益，就跟一个人在历史里的标签一样，到晚年他已经在思考史书里的位置了，改革开放就是他希望在史书里有较好名声的一个路线。）</p>

<p>第一，保共产党执政，等于未来改革开放的社会矛盾爆发后，他的改革开放会受挫。</p>

<p>第二，保改革开放，等于未来共产党遇到挑战后，他的共产党身份和地位会下降。</p>

<p>因此邓的选择，就是短期保共产党，长期保改革开放，因为改革开放是他以共产党领袖的身份推行的路线，所以他默认是希望尽可能让共产党永久执政的。</p>

<p>如果独立看邓小平，可能会晕头转向。</p>

<p>但是有对比参照陈云就知道了，陈云就是不惜一切代价让共产党永远执政，包括牺牲掉改革开放和社会发展，邓小平则是希望让共产党执政，但有前提，尽量用更能服众的办法，比如经济发展和法律进步，也能反应他明白强行执政是不可能的。</p>

<p>可因为价值观和个人利益原因，他不可能再往前了，只是不继续堵死所有路线，这才有了对香港的承诺，以及胡温允许选举方案的这个结果。</p>

<p>邓很大程度上是个承认客观现象的人，这也是为什么他不用计划经济，而是支持自己都知道更好的市场经济。</p>

<p>赵紫阳的相反可以反应邓的一些想法，邓是行政改革，赵紫阳下台后则是更进一步，希望有一个能过渡的反对党，来在中共下台后接手权力，避免全国陷入大规模混乱，我个人认为他的这个想法，一定程度是邓不愿意接受，但可能已经考虑到的未来，这也可能是邓给后续留的尾巴的一个原因。</p>

<p>而邓跟陈云左派交流，把自己的名字写进党章，确保了路线不会动摇。</p>

<p>共产党和改革开放都是他的命根子，两者互相矛盾时，肯定是保共产党，因为改革开放就是以共产党身份发起的，未来他们不希望见到的资产阶级自由化扩大，邓给的方案其实就是行政改革和法治来减少矛盾，</p>

<p>始终还是希望两个轮子能一起运作的，但等两个轮子越走越近开始互相别着的时候，就属于“相信后人的智慧”了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.30</strong> —–2022-12-05 19:54:12+08:00:</p>

<p>我觉得他在政治选择上算不上纠结，是很坚决的，但是对未来的事处于一种既要又要的状态。</p>

<p>当然这都不妨碍他骨子里就是要做六四镇压的主导者，铁了心要留血维护共产党地位，只不过看历史我们有时候会有多个角度切入，胡温的确按照邓的承诺对待香港也是事实，以后迟早会有评价的</p>

<p>—– <strong>1887.31</strong> —–2022-12-06 03:19:22+08:00:</p>

<p>他们讲究对内对外的区别，邓的法理主要是对党内，如果他预期中共继续执政下去，不会希望自己死后在党内站不住脚被否定，跟毛怕自己死后被翻案一样。</p>

<p>对党外可以不讲原则和信用，但是内部组织还是要讲逻辑和道理，否则他们内部组织就无法凝聚在一起，当然这个看情况，多数是相对的。</p>

<p>建国早期还能邀请民主人士参与政治事务，到后来就越来越孤立和排斥了。</p>

<p>邓面临的问题更大，因为发展到最后是个中共想掌权，但面对一个难以抓得牢的社会，决定政党路线生死，以及个人死后在历史里的地位，会出现结果，不是嘴上双标过一段就没人记得的事。</p>

<p>当时没有严格意义上的封疆大吏存在，有的只是文革后百废待兴，改革开发后随着经济发展起来，行政因为屡次学潮没有更迭上的传统行政问题。</p>

<p>计划经济时代，地方经济权力全部被抓在中央手中，主要维护的政治与经济制度都是以计划经济体系为主。</p>

<p>这个背景下才有家庭联产承包制偷偷在私下运作，以及小岗村这样生死状的出现，就是因为实在活不下去了。</p>

<p>到正式打算改革开放的前夕，毛主义在党内还是非常有威望，对毛的制度普遍当作日常一部分看待。</p>

<p>也因此搞市场化改革在地方和党内反而都是阻力重重，陈云等人反对死板的计划经济，但不反对计划经济本身，搞右派的市场化就是在违“祖制”，因此推广是十分困难的。</p>

<p>邓一个人在党中央内部如果拿不出实例也根本没法推行，就是因为地方上赵紫阳和万里敢冒风险推广新制度，才给邓在中央的方向与话语权提供了事实基础，而胡耀邦在党内提供了理论基础。</p>

<p>地方要是真有一些根本不存在的封疆大吏，毛泽东活着的时候计划经济早就被翻天了，搞市场经济还用偷偷摸摸从家庭联产承包制开始，私下签生死状搞起来吗？</p>

<p>赵紫阳工作期间，都是地方对中央哭穷，前几十年搞的地方穷到底死，地方的国企都唯唯诺诺，不知道怎么做改革，完全失去自主性，搞活化就用了不少力气，地方因为要试点更多东西，才有了各种特区。</p>

<p>赵紫阳和邓小平的观点就是灵活利用外资带来的资金与技术，去盘活死水一潭的地方企业，地方要钱没有，要政策可以给，可就算这样，地方还是搞不定信贷，总是借新还旧，当时赵紫阳已经在搞中央财政减负，但是事权对等，不像后来分税制进一步弱化了地方的权力，但办事却更多，让这种畸形结构成为政府主流。</p>

<p>从当时开始地方已经开始使用基建带动经济的做法，区别是当时需求率极大，不像现在高度饱和，所以问题主要来自于财政赤字，陈云提出要财政平衡，赵紫阳之后就给地方摊牌中央还会负责一些关键领域的资金，其他的要你们自己搞，原本就是都穷，后来地方做起来了，中央政治保守化后就抛弃原来路线，开始事权不对等的畸形化而已。</p>

<p>只不过代价就变成民众要吃土地财政的债，因为土地等不动产资源中央是没法有效变现的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1898.1</strong> —–2022-12-02 22:23:29+08:00:</p>

<p>那就假设一下这个有趣的议题吧。</p>

<p>广东被三大穷省包围，旁边唯一好点的就是福建，但也不怎么样。</p>

<p>广东境内贫富差距很大，城市和城市落差过于明显，似乎珠三角常规语境里已经等同于整个广东，而附近没有多少耕地可以维持这么多人口，外来劳动力也肯定会涉及大量居留权以及治安问题，这种背景下要做好跟黑帮斗半个世纪到一百年的准备。</p>

<p>实际上这种语境下的广东，可能只是以澳门香港为起点的一个U型城市群，最远到背面的清远，经过深圳、东莞、广州、佛山、中山、澳门，稍微近点云浮那都没法比了。</p>

<p>潮汕就不用想了，人家自己搞不好还得在粤东再分走一半地，成立一个潮汕共和国，大概率珠三角最多拿到惠东县，至于白盆珠水库肯定是潮汕的。</p>

<p>茂名湛江再组合成一个西粤，肇庆为主，云浮、阳江为辅，成立中粤，韶关也许能拉上清远有个北粤。</p>

<p>算部分水域大概两万平方公里，不算大概一万三到一万五多些，跟北京相当，跟日本比较大的一些县差不多，珠三角人口两年前是8600万，未来十年到十五年破亿是大概率事件。</p>

<p>大概也不复杂，就相当于日本人口，居住在一个县内，或者是东京都市圈住满全日本人口，以及北京塞了一个亿人口（相当于中国现在十四分之一的人口都住在北京），还不算未来后续加入的外来劳工（本地工作的你不能踢出去了，只能默认原本各省所属的流动人口，在成立的一瞬间就是国民身份）</p>

<p>估计就是寸土寸金了，没有多少耕地，四面环山，水源有限，超大号香港。食物和劳动力都要外部供给，前提是本地有足够多就业和高附加值产业能养得起八九千万，乃至上亿人口。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1898.2</strong> —–2022-12-02 23:29:55+08:00:</p>

<p>珠三角严重依赖外部的资源与劳动力输入都能独立，其他地区的地方领头羊也可以选择独立，这些穷乡僻壤，他们能抓紧政权就可以在地方搞军阀管制，越穷越容易出现这种状况。</p>

<p>珠三角的经济发达或许有意识形态的独立需求，但其他穷乡僻壤只要环境允许就可以进行军事独立，这种碎片化的情况无论民国，还是二战后全球各地军阀迭起都有很多例子了，是社会演化的必然形态。</p>

<p>这些地区既不能享受原来发展中的好处，还要承担脱离后的坏处。</p>

<p>最基本的一点，潮汕人自己都叫自己是潮汕人为先，宗族和地方意识比珠三角强多了，就算是独立，你觉得潮汕放弃自己一贯文化传统可能性更大，还是反过来，珠三角并入潮汕的可能性更大，如果没有矛盾，潮汕也没义务必须跟珠三角合并。</p>

<p>珠三角连本地就业到时候都不够用，还给潮汕和其他地区补贴，那不白独立了。</p>

<p>那些土地不是你的，你怎么保证当地那么远的城市，当地的人就一定乐意呢，茂名湛江更是直接决定海南陆路生死，如果海南不支持独立，或者海南也独立但拉拢茂名湛江，想要建立以海南人、茂名人、湛江人为主体的海南-粤西联合体，占据珠三角，驱赶珠三角人口，该怎办？</p>

<p>深圳这样外来人口为主的城市，文化上更是跟本地格格不入，却占据非常重要的一环，香港虽然说粤语，却跟广州是另外一回事，更别说广州说粤语的人也越来越少了。</p>

<p>别说南亚那么远了，就算东南亚语言不通，引进的成本，你要安排衣食住行，要担心治安，你想引进多少人来满足近亿人口的各类需求，10%就是差不多一千万人。能安心引进这么多外来劳动力，起码既无外患也无内忧，且对外经济发达。</p>

<p>不可无缘无故就把附近几个离得远的地区默认成自己土地，人家也没义务非要跟珠三角贴合，除非是盟友，但谁能保证永远是呢，珠三角能以广东名义独立，就敢有人一个个市里闹武装革命，一个镇一个家族，联合在一起，穷乡僻壤的大山里那就是游击队和军阀。</p>

<p>而且因为民族集成度高，打下来也没民族融合成本，不需要跟异族一样等好多年慢慢消化，军事能不断胜利，就可以吞掉比自己更大的目标，更远的说，如果是独立，那华北平原里逐渐做大的统一政权，掌握最多人口与资源，开始南下要求统一了，如何当之？</p>

<p>就算我给你一个内部完全没矛盾的广东，海南也好还是附近都不闹，所有事情都纯粹理想化，舍弃一切现实可能遭遇的障碍。</p>

<p>按照前几天的社会运动来看，估计会抽出手来搞全国高校自改革开放以来力度最大的审查和深度整顿，很多学生估计到时候会遭殃，国内的和国外的留学生都跑不了，而且国外留学生相对容易查，所以内外的都要注意安全了。</p>

<p>甚至可能每个能找到的视频都按照严重刑事案件一样，调动同级别警力去逐个逐个人处理，花费超出想象的成本去极其严肃完成这件事。</p>

<p>这个过程里也许就会有冤案和大量不必要的波及、连坐，用以警告学生，就像那句话说的好，“儿子就是他的软肋”，反过来家人也是学生和社运人士的软肋。</p>

<p>我现在最期待的是习犯蠢，把这个不能上台面的政治事件，跟批判香港运动一样，拿到台面来，放到官媒，尤其是CCTV，让社会大众知晓，到时候节目效果肯定爆炸。</p>

<p>大家要盯紧中共能装死到什么时候，一两年内，如果他们坚持选择冷处理装死，那说明他们打死也不愿意矛盾公开化，就可以判断出他们对社运的真实态度，是清楚知道自身处于舆论劣势的，那对付他们用这种手段就更有效，当然也要观察最近一两年内对国内抓捕力度，上面有提过了。</p>

<p>不清楚会不会真这么蠢，因为目前还没看到官方打算公开讨论的迹象，似乎都只是想边缘化冷处理，当不存在来避免公关危机，但没准就纯粹是疫情加重，江泽民丧事没办完两个因素，外加上述所说，国安对学生和这些人的处理才刚展开。</p>

<p>没准要等几个月后结束了，突然放出一大堆电视认罪的画面，然后什么新华社什么钟声，一起跳出来爆发式井喷发文，指责境外势力，跟着播报一圈证据，免费给反贼宣传，原本就怕别人不知道，现在人家出来主动宣传。</p>

<p>你们说，反贼该不该给习总书记和中宣部的恩人们挨个建生祠？</p>

<p>这个运动最缺乏的，不是反对也不是支持，而是传播力度不足。</p>

<p>中共经济牌打不好，清零牌也不行，大趋势下潜在反贼是越来越多的。</p>

<p>很多人可能根本没听过这件事，也没看过相关视频，更不知道可以这样做。</p>

<p>所以只存在于少数社会上有政治主动性的群体里，那中共做这件事，他可能是短期内狠狠批判惩罚少数反贼，在舆论上借着堵嘴占据高地。</p>

<p>但是却没法决定在经济恶化的情况下，人们怎么看他们，中共把这件事晒出来给十四亿人看，到处宣扬，就是教人民社运和结社。</p>

<p>相当于中共给反贼打免费广告，利用他们官媒渠道把这件事的影响力和存在给坐实。</p>

<p>反贼要的是，有一次事件，能在大众视野里传播，把反党口号和群体的客观存在给公开化。</p>

<p>打破十四亿大众三十多年来的稳定幻觉，告诉他们，原来这个世界不是一直稳定，社会是会乱起来的，反贼不需要求爷爷告奶奶的挨个民众求觉醒，只要经济持续下滑，清零持续进行，人人都可能成为反贼。</p>

<p>想一下，不考虑这件事，不考虑清零，你是一个岁静粉红或者日子人，坚信社会不会出问题，你出生时如此，死去时也该如此，跟呼吸一样理所当然。</p>

<p>突然有一天，政府开始公开承认和批判社会上有那么一群数量不小的人，公然在一线城市，党的核心腹地里聚集大喊共产党下台，这意味着什么，这个口号喊出来，意味着政治斗争，让社会洗牌的一些历史事件，又开始回归到大众视野里，是一次六四后对党的权威的严重挑战。</p>

<p>中共处理不好的问题只会越来越多，合订本会越来越厚，而形势比人强，粉红也可能因为防疫或者经济有怨气，变成潜在反贼。</p>

<p>那再回头看你合订本，你这个政权就是毫无威信的草台班子了，有的人是只信仰铁拳，属于畏威而不怀德，但铁拳都打不出力道，这种人看在眼里，就算不跟反贼合流，他也很难再去支持中共本身了。</p>

<p>现在太短了，看不出端倪，香港社运也是几个月后火力才逐渐拉高的，现在国内应该是还在处理疫情问题为首，之后是新年讲话，然后是过年，得给21年一系列问题做总结，习近平自身提社运问题的可能性很小，但也不是没有。</p>

<p>目前已知的是很多当初参与的人已经失踪了，可以暂时判定为被捕。</p>

<p>大体上是三个方向：</p>

<p>1.习近平自己在春节和元旦这点期间的讲话主动戳破，说带来的问题和社会不满，隐晦提到一些，做个现代罪己诏来借坡下驴，因为国内目前有比较明显说是因为社运导致放开的舆论风声。</p>

<p>2.习近平照样做讲话，但年末到新年这段不会处理过于敏感的政治话题，但随后官方会不同程度去从官方渠道释放消息，比如电视认罪，就跟我上面说的一样，走老流程三部曲，刚好今年被捕的人到明年春季也有几个月了，国安的人应该有足够时间审讯和编排认罪流程。</p>

<p>3.冷处理，官方当没事发生不直接下场，但是其他渠道通过一些第三方渠道，找自媒体去旁敲侧击说颜色革命，其实月初已经有了，但是后续没看到太多跟进，可能是在蓄力，或者已经放弃了。</p>

<p>现在疫情正盛，既有埋怨政府过快一刀切开放的，也有抱怨是社运导致开放的，后者我觉得按道理对多数人来讲都说不通，逻辑不自洽，比较怀疑中共会不会这么蠢把话题引到这个方向。</p>

<p>总体上是至少需要半年到一年才能观察出结果。</p>

<p>这就是为什么周其仁比温铁军强几个档次的原因。</p>

<p>他话其实已经讲的很明白了，非常露骨，如果了解八十年代改革的状况，就知道他说的半拉子改革暗指什么。</p>

<p>八十年代土地财政改革是为了配合地方资源和事权匹配使用的，目的是解绑地方活力，但是六四以后一切制度性改革开始转为保住党内的利益为主，保守派占据上风，直接导致一些原本用于临时性、过渡性或者早期准备的制度，被拿来充当一个剥削性工具。</p>

<p>很多问题都是改革到一半，六四导致停滞，配套跟不上，那么利益全都被政府汲取去了，就跟竭泽而渔一样。</p>

<p>胡温时期象征性推进了一些八十年代就设想好的改革路线，但是很难进行实质性的大刀阔斧改动。</p>

<p>而视频里其实周其仁说的就是，我拳头大，我就能逼你农民群体就范这个核心要点。</p>

<p>温铁军的逻辑就是，我们也不要谈农民被谁的拳头逼迫就范，我们应该让农民多垫几层棉花，这样挨打时才不疼，不至于几拳就把他打死，好细水长流，全然不提拳头是谁的，该不该打，是对问题本质视而不见的恶。</p>

<p>包括现在对宅基地的干预，对农民在农村用地的限制增加，很多都是为地方土地财政不继做后手。</p>

<p>因为地方土地财政的地价要稳定，不能过高也不能低了，土地都要入市，反应到市场价格。</p>

<p>那么政府拿货的时候，有固定指标，肯定要有限吃地来控制价格，那地不够了，怎么才能并入更多土地进市场呢？答案周其仁也说了，本质就是把农民土地当成一种需要时就吸两口的血包，跟汉尼拔吃人一样，让这个人不死去保持新鲜度的需求，需要时拿出来切两片再放回去。</p>

<p>不止赚了低价征地的差价，还要让开发商背负低利润。</p>

<p>相当于一个一块地，农民如果100元出手，合理价格到开发商那的成本价格上可能是130元，卖给民众的市场价格是180元。但政府作为拳头最大的中间商，他逼你70元出手，200元卖给开发商。开发商也要承担多出来的20元成本，也就意味着利润很低，房子价格只能调高到220元来弥补这一点。</p>

<p>有一个可能现在中国人听了会很感到可惜的地方，就是八九年的学运给部分国家提了醒，让没放权或者正在进行放权过渡期的国家群众警惕性更高。</p>

<p>因为中国共产党直接展开血腥暴力镇压，并且之前给了四二六社论定性，导致其他共产党管制的国家里，群众们都做好了提防准备，并且把当地共产党摆在了一个尴尬的舆论位置。</p>

<p>这些国家当地的运动可能之前就已经开始，但是分水岭很多都是在四二六社论和六四发生后才快速推进的。</p>

<p>如果反过来，东欧方面先出现血腥镇压，中国这面做一样的事就很难下得来台，因为到六月三号前后，还有不少人意识不到这点，李鹏给完最后警告后，就只剩下赵紫阳违背党内规则去提醒了。</p>

<p>虽然考虑到东欧一些国家的社会构成，累积的社会运动，以及共产党的控制程度有限，迟早也是要走向垮台的，但六四催化或者说巩固了这件事落成。</p>

<p>假设是东欧那面先发生改组或放权之前的血腥冲突，舆论优势可能就会反哺中国八九年学运，所以实际上从内部角度看，各国本身具备其成熟条件，但共产党面对交权的极端政治环境，会有什么反应，是个未知问号，而这个外部影响的角度看，对中国人来讲就挺遗憾的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1901.2</strong> —–2022-12-03 15:03:33+08:00:</p>

<p>我不算十分了解韩国这方面的细节，但就我个人理解，首先政治环境不同，光州事件前后，韩国最高层和政局本身就不稳，朴正熙本身是推翻第二共和国军事政变上台，他还被刺杀，这就导致瞬间真空，且当局法理来源彻底消失。</p>

<p>这就让民众从朴正熙时代的不满，发展后的分配不公全都累计在一起爆发，第二共和国虽然短暂，但是确实存在过，当时的法理依据也健全，否定其意义的朴正熙以外死亡，锅盖就压不住了，全斗焕的七年一到就坐不安稳。</p>

<p>光州其实已经进入民主化的开端，六月革命更像是一个结果，虽然事件上是独立的，但凑在一起才形成了一个完整的过程。</p>

<p>六四方面不同，刚从穷日子里过来，甚至市场改革也没完成，社会的普遍利益没有被统一在一起，人们普遍还是更服从威权化管制，市场化后带动的社会政治观念进步尚未全面发生，一切向钱看的观念，八十年代早期就已经有了。</p>

<p>这意味着持续发展，以及中国的过于庞大，单独少数城市的不满容易被平息，而不像韩国土地少，但是核心城市的社会运动已经能决定全国趋势。</p>

<p>而中国当时政治环境是政治保守派占据上风，政权早期特性就是以斗争为纲领，经历过大规模的内战和对基层肃反，有丰富的管控基层舆论和暴力经验，并且老人们都还在，能维系政治版图不分裂，但即便如此还是在党内出现了大规模分裂。</p>

<p>在之后中国的经济发展非常迅速，野蛮生长掩盖了许多矛盾，过程当中管控没有消失，还在不断加强，一直到习近平时代大功告成，经济增长也带来了政府的财政优势。</p>

<p>实际上中共在六四后也遇到很多社会问题和财政问题，但每次都在问题可能做大前，就集中资源扑灭了。</p>

<p>加上中国原本是个农业国，农业社会里的主要生产秩序就是威权主义，这样的环境下，族群易于服从，也更倾向于被管制。</p>

<p>中国全面现代化的进程很慢，大部分人都是有口饭吃就行，精神和意识形态还没从农业社会里转向到工业社会，也即个人权力的不彰显和无所谓。</p>

<p>人口规模十分庞大，意味着转化困难，需要的时间也很长，相反人口越少，越容易转向，社会的政治变革需求还没到一个临界点，变成功能性的，而六四则更多是聚焦在非功能性领域。</p>

<p>清零后的社运实际就是功能性的需求开始浮现，这样的表达也就在未来会更普遍了，尤其是经济下滑的背景下。</p>

<p>跟之前判断一样，官方就是单线程，无法既要清零，又快速准备大量的医疗资源和新体系构建去用于应对，因为一旦清零撑不住，无论是经济原因放弃，还是传播不可控放弃，都必然会造成医疗资源挤兑。</p>

<p>而目前中共仍然用疫情早期的医疗资源作为最后应付手段，但是对比传播力度，可以说是杯水车薪，因为疫情早期感染人数是有限。</p>

<p>全国2021年医院总数36570家，医院病床数7412566张（741万）</p>

<p>2021年所有医疗结构（包括社区服务站、乡镇、农村的卫生院室、特定卫生机构）总共1022922家（102万），全国病床总数9448448张（944万）</p>

<p>病床使用率是74.6%，公立医院高达80.3%，考虑到有一部分病床是给特定疾病预留，以及看病的人习惯到更大更好的医院，因此人口密集地区的医院病床使用率可能已经饱和了。</p>

<p>以香港死亡率算0.52%，不考虑重症占用的床位，因为严重到濒死或死亡的大概率是要占据床位的。</p>

<p>超大城市的一千万人口比例来算，一千万人感染就是52万张床位，三千万人感染就是起码150万张床位，但是床位一年只新增了34.8万张，每千人口的床位在疫情最前期的一年，只从 6.46张增加到6.70张。</p>

<p>也就是说，平均算下来，一千人争不到7张床位。</p>

<p>21年新增34.8万张床位里，医院里公立只有11.6万张，民营占据16.6万张，所以到时候跑公立医院只会更少，因为人都往那跑。</p>

<p>乡镇的总床位是141.7万张，其中新增只有2.7万张。</p>

<p>到是全国中医类的医院、社区中心或乡镇医疗点，总床位增加到高达7.2万张。</p>

<p>所以可以看得出，实际上乡镇农村大概率是要被放弃的，并且中医类会作为兜底凑合活的一种消极方案。</p>

<p>另外比较有意思的一个地方是，2021比起2020年，政府卫生支出下降了3%，更多是社会卫生指出的增长，能看出来给政府本体减压的情况。</p>

<p>20年卫生总开支是7.21万亿，21年总开支是7.55万亿，实际上我觉得22年的情况，开支低于8万亿，根本不够用于承担全面放开所需的资源。</p>

<p>有人计算全国常态化核酸费用是一年约1.45万亿，那实际上可以看得出，与其你浪费资金做三年核酸，不如尽早投入更多资金到医疗体系的改革当中。</p>

<p>现在最搞笑也是最怕的地方，就在于既没钱做核酸了，也没钱管控疫情了。</p>

<p>经济被三年封控拖垮，核酸投入的资金又无法回笼到社会各界刺激经济循环，三年白干，医疗系统危机还是回到三年前起步的阶段。</p>

<p>香港死亡率是基于感染人口的0.52%，住院率是4.75%，不过这里说的不是会死52万人，可能有歧义了，是指整体住院占用床位的一定峰值，人死之前也得占床位，我看到一些上海相关数据显示住院率是9.2%，香港感染率目前累积约30%。</p>

<p>上海如果也感染30%就是约750万人，跟香港一样的住院率应该是35万张床位需求，如果是上海数据的住院率去考虑就是将近70万，有些地区如果考虑流动人口都有上千万规模，感染率恐怕更高，床位防线可能会医疗资源挤兑击穿。</p>

<p>我觉得目前人口真实数字还是没问题的，泄露的那个数据源太单一，甚至不能作为严谨的人口估算证据，至少得有更多证据才好去建立一个观点，否则会太草率。</p>

<p>因为考虑一个政府工作逻辑，更多的人口，意味着更多的税收和开销，中央是要管地方多要钱的，之前GDP挤水分就有一个因素是地方财政达不到中央要求，对账本发现有问题，地方也实在给不出吹出来的GDP那么多的税金了。</p>

<p>人是最小的经济活动单位，人口对不上，意味着所有数据都有问题，要是漏了几个亿人口，那政府会判断错所有信息，我觉得地方可能有人口偏差，但不会过大，中央寻求数据真实性和透明度时，会比外界更在意能拿到多少数据。</p>

<p>即便能有效果，也只是地区独立的，很容易被分化。</p>

<p>也就是说他们实际是在给自己争取待遇，但这里会遇到一个实践死局。</p>

<p>既然他们是争取待遇，打比方一小时19元，劳工预期值可能会希望是25元（不考虑实际的），这样不用每天干10小时。</p>

<p>现在因为不满意这个价格，要涨然后举起来闹事，活动地点大概率也是聚集在厂房一带。</p>

<p>你可以给他们看马列，但他们可能追求的只是涨薪这一件事，只要求功能性待遇改善，一旦涨薪达到预期值，他们还需要工作和养家糊口，要有一个稳定的生活状态，就没有核心动力与凝聚力。</p>

<p>这个时候厂老板又会从不满的对象，变成发钱的老板。</p>

<p>也就是说赚钱初衷没变，所以除非有一些事件能引起共鸣形成串联，先刺激了劳工的情绪，让谈判本身难以进行，并且厂房又无法立刻解决问题或答应部分条件。</p>

<p>最后还是要消散的，事件只能作为一个短期增加地方成本的热点，劳工的雇佣环境还是没变的，可能稍微变好了一些。</p>

<p>经济形势不明朗，如果要求待遇增加厂方成本，肯定会到一定程度触及上限，厂方宁可拉黑名单也不会随意妥协，工会也没有自主权力，更别提真正意义上的工会是无法在当下生存的。</p>

<p>所以我对劳工运动作为一个社运触发点，觉得效率不会很高，可能单点事件爆发力强，但很难持续，局限性很大，因为利益分配的关系容易自行散掉，是没有政治性的运动。</p>

<p>官方会严厉关照这些事件，在当局强势时又会被严防死守。</p>

<p>相反，厂方给劳工的低收入，会不会是反贼的一个政治优势呢？不是说作为切入点去推动劳工运动，而是当民间有财力进行组织时，吸纳失业人口作为人力资源能快速成长，厂方给工资要经济产出，民间组织则是要政治产出，避开了传统工运在当下环境的劣势，直接跳过工运阶段提供组织。</p>

<p>否则按照传统的路线，应该是：1.有人内部进行组织。2.罢工。3.运动逐渐形成政治和经济上的要求。4.规模扩大后串联形成政治性组织。5.逐渐建立武装。（在这个过程里，来自工运转化的人力资源在政治性组织里是高度统一的，因为两者联系紧密）</p>

<p>现在是做不了1-4步骤的，但官方财政出空缺后，被长期针对性打击的厂房劳工也很难迅速演化出像样的组织团体，甚至可能中共临死前最后一点劲都按在这个厂房用于保证经济生产和税源。</p>

<p>那就会变成民间的政治组织跟劳工的联系不紧密，就更需要功能性的手段去取代原来厂方的角色，让劳工也有成为选择组织的人力资源的可能，不能单纯依靠意识形态画大饼，因为中共隔绝的太狠，没有太多机会培育这种劳工内的组织。</p>

<p>这个不要紧，他能吸收时，说明有钱，民间组织在地方也搞不起来，他不能吸收时，民间组织自然有空间能搞起来了，就不担心被不被官方吸收。</p>

<p>到了社会动荡那种程度的底部，肯定是市场供给大于需求，重点是民间组织哪里搞钱，怎么让收支循环建立起来，这就属于下一步的问题了。</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Christopher Blattman, Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at Columbia University.]</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this war is also rooted in ideology. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies the validity of Ukrainian identity and statehood. Insiders speak of a government warped by its own disinformation, fanatical in its commitment to seize territory. Ukraine, for its part, has held unflinchingly to its ideals. The country’s leaders and people have shown themselves unwilling to sacrifice liberty or sovereignty to Russian aggression, no matter the price. Those who sympathize with such fervent convictions describe them as steadfast values. Skeptics criticize them as intransigence or dogma. Whatever the term, the implication is often the same: each side rejects realpolitik and fights on principle.<br />
Russia and Ukraine are not unique in this regard, for ideological belief explains many long wars. Americans in particular should recognize their own revolutionary past in the clash of convictions that perpetuates the war in Ukraine. More and more democracies also look like Ukraine—where popular ideals make certain compromises abhorrent—and this intransigence lies behind many of the West’s twenty-first-century wars, including the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. It is seldom acknowledged, but closely held principles and values often make peace elusive. The war in Ukraine is just the most recent example of a fight that grinds on not because of strategic dilemmas alone but because both sides find the idea of settlement repugnant.</p>

<p><strong>From Matt Pottinger, Matthew Johnson, and David Feith:</strong> “At the party congress, Xi was granted a third term as the CCP’s top leader—an unprecedented development in the contemporary era and a crucial step in his effort to centralize authority. But perhaps even more significant was the way the congress served to codify a worldview that Xi has been developing over the past decade in carefully crafted official party communications: Chinese-language speeches, documentaries, and textbooks, many of which Beijing deliberately mistranslates for foreign audiences, when it translates them at all. These texts dispel much of the ambiguity that camouflages the regime’s aims and methods and offer a window into Xi’s ideology and motivations: a deep fear of subversion, hostility toward the United States, sympathy with Russia, a desire to unify mainland China and Taiwan, and, above all, confidence in the ultimate victory of communism over the capitalist West. The end state he is pursuing requires the remaking of global governance. His explicit objective is to replace the modern nation-state system with a new order featuring Beijing at its pinnacle.”</p>

<p><strong>From Matt Pottinger, Matthew Johnson, and David Feith:</strong> The contest between democracies and China will increasingly turn on the balance of dependence; whichever side depends least on the other will have the advantage. Reducing Washington’s dependence, and increasing Beijing’s, can help constrain Xi’s appetite for risk—and when coupled with U.S. cooperation with Australia, Japan, and Taiwan to field an unmistakably superior and well-coordinated military presence in the western Pacific, constrainment offers the best way to prevent the “stormy seas of a major test” that Xi seems tempted to undertake as he begins his second decade as China’s dictator.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-11-28~2022-12-04的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-02/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-11-28~2022-12-04的言论" /><published>2022-12-02T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-02/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-12-02/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>所以实际也抛出了一个问题，如果什么都是图一乐，也说明给了自己一个精准定位，那即是不会以共情角度切入去着手解决问题，观点始终出发自社会的问题就让社会解决，总之与我无关，我是旁观者，其实到也没什么，但基本就跟未来入主主流社会说再见了。</p>

<p>无论什么情况下，解决问题的动力和提出解决问题的机制，都必须建立在靠拢现实生活这一点上。社会迟早会进入动荡，中共迟早也会下台，但是这之后的真空，以及牵扯所有人生活具体的走向，到底该不该由自己抓紧主导，我想这个命题其实不复杂。</p>

<p>如果什么都不想牵扯，已经润了的根本无所谓，但很难说既要有情绪去表达，又无所谓会发生什么，因为人在网络上再怎么样都好，都要回归现实生活。</p>

<p>我觉得浪人不是问题，有人表达什么也不是问题，人是不一样的，要接受这一点，只是讨论一些缺乏实际的话题时观点偏散，有情绪表达重叠了，到了现实生活是另一码事。</p>

<p>本质问题还是在于，对键政的初衷和最后目的赋予一个定位，是”都完蛋了所以你们跟我一起死“的绝望后的无所谓，还是”其实我有想表达的，但是情绪总是占主导“，这就见仁见智了。</p>

<p>哪种都无所谓，人人都有选择的自由，因为话语权在现实世界是客观存在的，你不抓，也迟早有人会来抓，而现实世界不会跟你一起完蛋，所以理性上我想应该不会有人要发泄情绪，但眼睁睁看着话语权旁落，要么是你放弃抓住这种跟现实话语权，要么是赛博张献忠发泄情绪（说来你不信，但这其实是最人畜无害的，起码嘴上再狠，他不敢去真杀人。）</p>

<p>还有团结香港基金会有不少港商影子，拍过一个香港事中国心的系列纪录片，因为香港很多商人乡土观念重，都会回故土投资和出资建设，不少都是本地同乡会出来的，这部分其实很多已经不记名，官方基本不给宣传资源，我认为是有意淡化这群大逃港背景下发达的商人影响力。</p>

<p>国内的话，虽然也允许说，但为了突出党和邓的率先杰出贡献，所以实际上是把港商当年的影响给边缘化了，有些港商可能就是为了强调自己世系的这一份功劳，才会去拍名为连接大陆，实为强调自身影响力，莫要人忘掉的片子。</p>

<p>应该会有更灵活可变的疫情封控措施，意味着可能管控宽松的下限或许会一定扩大，但必要时也会再次的非常严格，以避免封控下限太高导致类似问题发生，而不一定会统一划线执行宽松策略。</p>

<p>可以肯定的是，对封控导致的突发群体事件，肯定会更加严格，用以提防类似事情再次发生，一些负责镇压的机关会常态化高度警戒，大多数普通警察、少部分武警可能会提前多年喜获“ 鞍不离马，甲不离身”的全国动乱体验卡。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1857.3</strong> —–2022-11-26 23:04:36+08:00:</p>

<p>地方实际没什么能跟中央博弈的地方，地方的压力就是中央的压力，因为地方要是垮台了，出现前所未有的政治事件，你还施压给地方，他也根本做不了，成本都要中央承担。</p>

<p>只要不是财政危机这种结构性问题，可能因为接手一下就把直接拖死中央的（目前中央都是嘴上说不救，但还是会想办法给行政资源），中央都会最终接手负责和决策，只不过最后执行的是地方，背锅的也只能是地方。</p>

<p>乌鲁木齐是新疆省会，新疆特殊性不言而喻，这样的地方能给开放指标，不可能不问过中央意思，中央要追求政治一致，但也不是一味的愚蠢，遇到需要开闸解压的地方也会给出理性反应。</p>

<p>但之后可能会是对地方平民的进一步管控，以防这类事件再次发生，很多事都有类似例子，比如当年老兵上访事件，最后也是服软但冷处理，然后对部分人秋后算账，用一些短期敷衍利益去瓦解集体，再对整个有潜在威胁的集体进行预处理防止问题再次发生。</p>

<p>对乌鲁木齐地方上的官僚处理，那就要看中央认为他们在这些事件里有多大的责任了，让地方群情激愤变大，这是天大的责任，堂堂市委书记跑出来说官不做了，这也是不小的责任，有失中央和党的威信。</p>

<p>如果最后习近平或中委会内部认为他做得对，大事化了，乌鲁木齐的官僚可能被放过一次，如果认为他做得对，但功不抵过，仕途也就完蛋了。那我们现在不清楚中央最高层怎么想的，只能确定会有很多地方跟当年老兵上访一样，群众后续被秋后算账的可能性很大。</p>

<p>防疫本身是政治问题，放弃防疫会有政治威权冲击，但还没到放弃时，执行过程里就出现坚持防疫不动摇初衷导致的结果，那肯定是要优先处理群体事件的。</p>

<p>单纯是事件引发的连锁反应，民众一向有自发性，历史上的例子很多，当年周恩来死和胡耀邦死，自发性运动也很多，何况现在的大背景和信息传递更多。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.1</strong> —–2022-11-26 23:39:00+08:00:</p>

<p>这次应该也不会产生历史性事件，但把进度条堆高了不少。</p>

<p>可以看到一点，那就是目前政府人员还在老实的执行命令，说明了两个情况。</p>

<p>第一，政府还花得起钱去调度这些人员，并且这些人员的数量也足够覆盖现有群众。</p>

<p>第二，在政府工作人员的世界观看来，社会还没动荡到意识到为政府工作可能后续会有很大的成本，或者说叫“政治债”要偿还。</p>

<p>所以当满足以上两点时，社会大概率会进入一个高度动荡不稳定的时期。</p>

<p>也即，政府人员办事逃避或者敷衍，甚至欺骗高层，而不是老实按规则执行，他们按规则执行往往是基于稳定生活带给他们的日常感，如何打破这种日常感，我相信会随着越来越多暴力反抗出现，在内部开始传开，并且可能会有一些针对性报复行动，甚至警民大规模对立冲突后。</p>

<p>同时政府没钱了，这个是最重要的一点，目前来看还需要比较长的时间来酝酿，他们还是能挤出资金来用于调度大量人手，可惜的地方就在于，这一点没法通过反抗者的主观行为去加速。</p>

<p>这也是为什么我支持习主席就疫情清零坚持到底的原因，他不加速踩刹车，没人能就经济恶化进行加速，每个人都是一个独立个体，做不来这件事，只有错误的社会政策可以。</p>

<p>并且经济和财政恶化，是增加我们生力军和动员可存续性的一个关键指标，本着清零到底，我肉疼你下台没命的逻辑，搅混水去推动加速是很有必要的。</p>

<p>但目前事件只能说，跟上海、富士康、佩洛西访台、乌克兰战争打脸一样，都只是把政府公信力和威权一点点扒下来的其中一个事件。</p>

<p>民众不需要交流就明确反对和敌意的立场，也是需要一点点培养的，否则一旦停下来，大家还是要生活，会无法聚焦而失去方向，只有一系列事件下来，让矛头对准官方，扫清过去一层层的“解释”（比如，错的都是奴才，皇帝的本意是好的，或者不是你想的那样这种自我催眠），让官方最高层的意见，直接以被全民大多数反对的形式，暴露在公众舆论当中。</p>

<p>这一点是非常有必要的，现在没有那么多挡箭牌了，有的人可能还是重复上述自我催眠的话术，但大多数人的认知是越来越清晰，立场也越来越明确。</p>

<p>什么时候彻底走向对中共的彻底敌对，以及政府资金出现周转不济，以至于调度人员跟不上群体事件的时候，一次最终会超过六四的历史性事件爆发的可能性就越来越高了</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.2</strong> —–2022-11-27 01:12:59+08:00:</p>

<p>清零本身不是我们能决定的，也不是我们愿意看到的，但最终会加速一个无法纠正自身问题的系统瓦解，如果这个社会正常到遇见问题会解决，而不是为了政治目的坚持清零，我们自然也没迫切必要去反对它的存在。</p>

<p>也就是说，其政治目的本身，已经从治理社会，变成为了生存不惜一切代价，哪怕妨害国人生存也要坚持的程度，是不折不扣的二元对立。</p>

<p>还有就是长痛和短痛的问题，是让这样一个系统持续糜烂祸害中国几代人，耗费我们这一代人的青春年华，让未来一个世纪的中国都可能陷入巨大的风险里更好，还是说我们这一代人，咬咬牙成为代价替后人把事办了好呢？</p>

<p>更简明直接的讲，国内未来社会动荡，打内战或者血腥的地方冲突可能是个大概率事件，到底是我们这一代人上战场拿命去换后代的幸福更好，还是我们这一代得过且过，让我们中国人的子女，中国人的后代上战场去为我们解决一个被拖延已久的问题更好。</p>

<p>要是我们一整代人什么都不做，我们也会活的非常痛苦，并且痛苦可能延续更久，最终我们躲避的结局，要由后代来承担，那样的话很多人要白发人送黑发人了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.3</strong> —–2022-11-27 02:05:42+08:00:</p>

<p>所以建立武装和建立武装的环境是很有必要的</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.4</strong> —–2022-11-27 22:09:03+08:00:</p>

<p>那要看大多数人对内战的理解和定义是怎么样的了，几百万人的军队一枪不开不大可能，至少不是大概率事件，逼急中共总归会制造流血的，那到时候是不是需要武装力量保卫自己呢？</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.5</strong> —–2022-11-27 22:52:17+08:00:</p>

<p>就六四后的三十来年里，那是史无前例的，但我说的历史性事件，是可以直接让中共陷入重大政治危机和社会动荡的程度。</p>

<p>广义来说，这次也肯定是历史性事件的，群众公开喊共产党下台习近平下台，是很严肃且重大的政治问题。</p>

<p>但能烧多大的火，现在也才几天，后续不好说，越大越好，最主要的是时间，还有矛盾的升级，虽然理性上我认为不大可能一次性就发展成我希望看到的那种，但这也说不准，能有是最好的，没有也可以接受不必气馁，这次已经远超预期了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.6</strong> —–2022-11-28 10:04:11+08:00:</p>

<p>现代社会与建国前三十年所处的社会是完全不同的情况。</p>

<p>如果文革、大跃进里的灾难在现代中国发生，不但社会民众无法接受，在社会民众表达之前，政府可能就已经垮台，因为两个时代政府的体制也大有不同。</p>

<p>六四和现代只是处于同一逻辑下的自然反应，社会必然有的良性秩序的体现，本身是没很多人想的那种人和人的继承关系。</p>

<p>这也是为什么说加速很重要，因为这意味着官方做蠢事会把所有人推到对立面。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.7</strong> —–2022-11-28 11:53:21+08:00:</p>

<p>指望所有人知道，毕其功于一役是不切实际的，过去可以处理是因为有可以改革的余地，当现在改革的结果就是社会运动争取的结果时，就没有余地可言了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1859.8</strong> —–2022-11-28 13:13:00+08:00:</p>

<p>能一次性完成整个过程，自然是最好的，但想来也不怎么可能。</p>

<p>更务实的想法，是希望能把政治威权的神秘面纱给挑开，让大众认知到是可以出来喊过去以为很过激的口号，重点是培养习惯，也即社会政策与政治运动挂钩的习惯。</p>

<p>最重要的是，打破过去三十年来，社会必然稳定的错觉。让社会进入一个人人都能逐渐意识到的特殊时期。</p>

<p>褪去日常感，让人们开始明白历史车轮开始滚动，这是很重要的，因为维稳的原因，很难说明确达到哪个步骤，所以更迫切需求有标志性事件，打破三十年来的日常，让政治议题进入大众视野。</p>

<p>能在中共腹地的一线城市核心地段，聚集一大群人喊出共产党下台，这件事传播开是迟早的，它代表着一个分水岭，是人心思变的一个体现，因为有实际行动证明，不再是单纯过去日子人或粉红说的没人反对大家都支持。</p>

<p>这次政治关联还是很明确的，跟过往的不同，是愈发有所进步。</p>

<p>一个是明面是悼念去世的死难者，但现在舆论都很明确认为与清零防疫有关，而防疫政策是直接来自最高层的路线，这种指桑骂槐跟过去一样，是通过悼念死者表达对某些事的不满，如周恩来死对文革不满出来悼念，或胡耀邦死对保守主义不满。</p>

<p>一个是不要XX要XX的句式，是直接关系到四通桥彭载舟的，政治用意和具体指向非常明确，不是跟过去一样模糊化某个话题，使用者们是意有所指。</p>

<p>也就是说，政治意图和针对性更加明确，不再单纯局限于单一事件本身的情绪表达，李文亮时期还是相对模糊的，乃至上海时期骂中央决策层和上海政府的舆论也是各有部分，大巴的事出来后，再到现在，就愈发开始倾斜。</p>

<p>目前处于大脑宕机，官僚系统选择是常规维稳手段加装死，他们不傻，但始终是人，更详细反应要等过一段日子才能有，因为现在总共发生才两三天时间，事件全貌和热潮顶点仍未确定。</p>

<p>并且民众诉求基本上要么处于相对模糊，要么就是非常具体但根本不可能被接受（彻底放弃清零、习近平下台、共产党下台）</p>

<p>还有现在情况每天都在持续，如果短期内就结束，没有继续做大的迹象，那大概率就是厚脸皮装死，跟着软饭硬吃，现场抓人打击典型，杀一儆百。</p>

<p>基层维稳就瞅准了人群保护不了彼此时单抓，等热度一过去开始散开，就调动超大规模资源，用刑侦级手法想办法秋后算账。</p>

<p>所以所有参与者想不被秋后算账，要么一把火烧到底，要么就祈祷相关部门的科技没把你捕捉到。</p>

<p>当年四二六社论出来激化问题，就是因为被定性了导致学生们后路被截断，一旦散去就无法再靠人力组织去对抗公权力，现在连社论都不需要就直接维稳了，怎么自处其实参与者们应该想清楚后路，因此有人被抓，必须现场救回来，否则指挥者一旦没了，群众就土崩瓦解，到时候一个个秋后点名。</p>

<h3 id="1868-释放被抓公民放人可以作为口号之一吗-submitted-on-2022-11-27-2122440800">1868: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/z614j3/释放被抓公民放人可以作为口号之一吗/">“释放被抓公民”“放人”可以作为口号之一吗？</a>, submitted on 2022-11-27 21:22:44+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>1868.1</strong> —–2022-11-27 22:24:20+08:00:</p>

<p>出现封路要围追堵截，应尽早尽快转移阵地，打游击战，保证信息传递跟得上，让其他人能尽快知晓，避免散开导致人群不够集中，这样能增加他们的行政成本，让其变成惊弓之鸟草木皆兵，做出更多错误反应，靠他们犯蠢给这次事件火上添油。</p>

<p>最终目的是进一步扩大普通民众察觉到社会开始出现动荡的这一观念，一旦能形成，哪怕最后没有一气呵成，也可以大大加速，出现一个破窗效应，用更激进的做法，给原本大环境里都很敏感的话题与词汇争取发声空间。</p>

<p>最重要的是，肯站出来的都是生力军，要存人存己，保存宝贵力量，再待时而发，避免三而竭的情况发生，把这种运动式行为，用一个个话题套起来，每次都有新对抗和发声，就不再止于一个单独乌鲁木齐的话题，而是不断能转移到矛盾的核心上。</p>

<p>昨天是为了悼念，晚上是为了反共，今天是为了放人，总之要有一个话题能不断延续热度，再把目标绑定到一个不考虑政治立场，比如疫情经济问题也能挂钩的对象身上，习近平下台，共产党下台，就是一个过去多数人说出来无的放矢，现在疫情来了，便与所有人挂钩的话题。</p>

<p>破窗破的就是要把这个过去三十年来大众喊不出的口号，在日常生活里如茶余饭后一样不再忌讳，就是要挑战公权力，官方想处理这么多人是没资源的，政治需求公开化，不需要能上互联网讨论，只教人知道这件事也好，已是进步许多。</p>

<p>让更多人感觉到社会开始出现动荡，无论他们是吃瓜看戏，还是别的什么都好，模糊化这群骑墙派的观感非常重要。</p>

<p>疫情下封锁带来的经济话题就是尚方宝剑，粉红大V还是个人，如果犯蠢站在对立面，应该妥善直接利用这一点吃死对方，要一口气将其打成宁可经济完蛋，平民自杀也要维护党中央的叛国者，哪怕有现场参与直接怼公安脸上也是一个道理。</p>

<p>把 <strong>“共产党=永久清零=经济完蛋=个人利益受损”</strong> 的逻辑链简明扼要传递开，现在是很多人理性上感觉到了，但客观上还停留在六四后塑造的多年政治、社会、经济三重稳定的惯性错觉当中。共产党过去填充什么，我们就抢过来填充进去。</p>

<p>拿不到教科书、媒体的舆论宣传权，就一定要在现场能聚众时说出来，让更多人理解，才能传递观念，一传十，十传百，要像杀死宿主的病毒一样扩散和进化，潜伏、学习跟着再变得更聪明。</p>

<p>我们要打破社会三十年来的稳定错觉，让他们意识到，这个社会的问题不是永久性的消失，只会越积攒越大，中共未来也许会被逼到放弃清零，因此要尽早落实这种观念上的刻印。</p>

<p>要让我们成为反对清零的明确政治群体，这个群体不需要具体到哪些人，而是要站出来，说明确反对，哪怕他们接触清零，政治舆论上，也是归功于我们，而不是他们。相反，借助清零挑战威权政治的结果，一旦清零被放弃，就可以当作靶子，大打特打，我们要喊让共产党下台，习近平下台，逼中共放人妥协，作为这个政治群体破除威权迷信的第一战。</p>

<p>可能会失败，但失败不要紧，重点是要让人意识到这个群体开始在历史舞台上崭露头角。并且有了反对的实例，甚至成功了，给大家展示下，反对中共，他们软弱，就能得手，会给很多人跃跃欲试的想法，那么很多潜在矛盾和利益的话题里，群众事件就很容易串联起来。</p>

<p>但首先要在中共目前还没反应过来的时候，快速在大众印象里做好工作，要把火烧的旺一点，要旺一点就要观察对方动向，要多喊激进口号，让这些极其敏感的口号变得好像喝白水一样。</p>

<p>而且，不但要现场喊口号，还要现场演说，讲述上面的逻辑链，原本只是一时群情激愤参与，但一知半解的，或者是旁观路过的路人，再到在场的警务人员，都能利用这种方法去洗刷他们的观念，从而带来更多的潜在支持者，也需要分化便衣和警察之间的关系，尤其是从收入、待遇与政府下台后他们的遭遇讲起。</p>

<p><strong>另外很重要的一点，遇到警察抓人，打算杀一儆百，一定要拼命救回来，警察维持威权的一个是合法性，一个是拳头大的暴力。</strong></p>

<p>把警察自认为的暴力也给消除了，无法斗争过群众力量，给大家看到了，都会有样学样，警察如果敢动用更高的武力，矛盾就会不断升级，重点在于要破除警察的威权形象。</p>

<p>要让大家看到，他们抓人原来也是可以被无效化，出来让共产党下台是可以完全不需要承担责任，并且在场的同胞们会保护你，中国人保护中国人，而最不应该在有人被抓去杀鸡儆猴时只是操你妈，骂固然出气，但更重要的是做出行动，打政治威权的脸，让更多人放心去反抗。</p>

<p>否则你出来喊，大家都不救你，岂不是冷了兄弟姊妹们的心，一个被抓就都不上去，我不信男人女人没血性，上去直接把人抢回来，他能耐你何？做好身份保护，冬天戴帽子没人敢说什么，避免被秋后算账上门单独找，那个时候别人不好救你。</p>

<p>群众抗议有人被抓，再被救回来的视频只要越来越多，推广开来，大家会有样学样，到时候给人看看，中共到底肯做到哪一步，彻底破除稳定迷信，让政府的人，尤其是基层，也意识到给政府卖命不一定是最佳选择，才能客观上让他们摸鱼，出现枪口抬高一厘米的情况，因此也不应过度敌对，以保护自身和同胞为主。</p>

<p>No, because China and Japan did not go into isolation. In the case of Japan, ‘isolationism’ was used after the restoration to characterise Tokugawa policy as a way of discrediting the old regime, and, as /u/ParallelPain notes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iaxh4j/why_did_japan_decide_to_be_isolationist_during/">does not capture the finer points of Japan’s engagement with the outside world</a>. In the case of China, we ought not to conflate the policy of the Ming, which, per /u/_dk, imposed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2a9tgx/what_is_the_history_of_the_ming_dynastys_haijin/citfco1/?context=999">strict but not total constraints on maritime trade</a>, with the Qing, which, as an expansionist Eurasian empire, was <em>deeply</em> tied in with the global economy, as I cover <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c1we9g/why_was_the_treaty_port_system_operated_so/ergraoq/">here</a>. Arguably the only ‘isolationist’ state was Korea, but even then the Koreans maintained trade relations within East Asia even if it didn’t engage with the European powers. The notion that East Asian countries became these hermetically sealed entities has long been used both from within and without as a means of discrediting certain policies, but it is, on the whole, factually unsustainable.</p>

<p>Yes and no. Dragoons as originally conceived in the 17th century were mounted infantry, but dragoons and other ordinary ‘horse’ basically met in the middle by the early 18th century, largely fighting in close quarters in battle but retaining the ability to skirmish with firearms.</p>

<p>It’s a classic joke among linguists, orthographers and the like that ‘ghoti’ is a legitimate spelling of ‘fish’, as long as you pronounce:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘gh’ like in ‘cough’ where it makes a ‘f’ sound,</li>
  <li>‘o’ like in ‘women’ where it makes an ‘i’ sound, and</li>
  <li>‘ti’ like in ‘initial’ where it makes a ‘sh’ sound.</li>

<p>Mark Okrand, creator of Klingon, thus decided ‘ghotI’’ would be Klingon for ‘fish’.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tag! I’d like to throw in the additional detail that while genitives are not standard for Latin inscriptions on Roman coins, they <em>are</em> standard for Greek inscriptions on Hellenistic coins. Alexander-style tetradrachms for instance will have the issuing king’s name in genitive: <a href="https://www.baldwin.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/C201001272-1-20200207130607.jpg">Alexandrou</a>, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/AntiochusIVEpiphanes.jpg">Antiochou</a>, et cetera. This convention was also carried over into some Roman coins with Greek legends, although even by the third century the nominative was standard: compare <a href="https://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/tiberius/RPC_4005.jpg">Tiberiou (genitive)</a> with <a href="https://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/septimius_severus/Syd_389_var.jpg">Ceoueros (nominative)</a> This, in my view at least, lends credence to the ‘clueless forger’ explanation, although it doesn’t necessarily say whether this was an 18th century Hellenist doing a bad job of faking Latin, or a 3rd century forger misusing the older Greek conventions.</p>

<p>This is a niche one, but it’s the idea that the Treaty of Tientsin (Tianjin) in 1858 legalised opium in China. Opium does not appear in the text of <em>any</em> of the four versions of the treaty. Moreover, the Treaty of Tientsin was, rather infamously, not ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor, leading to a resumption of hostilities in 1859-60 that concluded in the Convention of Peking, whose first stipulation was that the Qing court had to ratify the earlier treaty. And yet, opium trading was legal all throughout this latter stage of hostilities. If the Qing refused to ratify the opium-legalising treaty, why was opium legal? Instead, it seems that opium was pretty quietly legalised domestically, quite probably to allow it to be taxed to raise funds for fighting the Taiping. There’s nothing to indicate it was ever forcibly legalised by treaty.</p>

<p>There’s any number of angles that may be taken here, and with the field of what we might term ‘critical Han studies’ being a relatively diverse one in terms of perspective, do please bear in mind that the one which I offer here is not the only one that exists. What I posit is that the expansiveness of Han identity is due to the following combination of factors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Han as an identity has historically been a political construct as well as a cultural one.</li>
  <li>Han identity has not been constructed purely on the basis of recognised in-group similarities, but also by way of contrast against an equally constructed Other.</li>
  <li>Han identity in its current form is a relatively recent construction emerging out of specific conditions that <em>made</em> it expansive, and thus relatively tolerant of internal variation.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a primer, /u/Drdickles and I both discussed a similar question <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/es9kd4/how_did_the_modern_chinese_concept_of_nationhood/">here</a>, and /u/hellcatfighter covers a similar topic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/b72sez/why_was_the_qing_dynasty_so_expansionist/f17ft9j/?context=999">here</a> and in a linked answer. But there is some scope for going more in-depth on your specific framing of the question, and we can go in the order of the points above.</p>

<p>Firstly, there has always fundamentally been a political dimension to how Han identity has been constructed, especially if we take a relatively state-driven, top-down approach. For instance, during the 11th century, when China was mostly ruled by the Song Empire apart from a small portion of the north ruled by the Khitan Liao, Han-ness was often defined as deriving from a relationship with the Song state. The Liao came to use the phrases <em>Han’er</em> and <em>Hanren</em> exclusively for former Song subjects who had been captured by or defected to the Liao, and while the Song did use <em>Han’er</em> and <em>Hanren</em> in formal communications with the Liao to describe what we might term ‘ethnic Chinese’ under Liao rule, internal writing generally lumped Liao-ruled Chinese under the labels of <em>Fan</em> (‘barbarian’) or <em>Beiren</em> (‘northerners’), set apart from the main body of Han Chinese. And yet a state-imposed category of Han could be expansive as well as restrictive: the Mongol Yuan used the term <em>Hanren</em> to encompass all of the subjects of the conquered Jin Empire, which included ‘ethnic Chinese’ but also Jurchens, Khitans, and Koreanic peoples like the Balhae and Goguryeo, while at the same time reserving <em>Nanren</em> for former Song subjects. We will return to this later, but bear in mind that ‘Han’ has a long history of fungibility and reconstruction.</p>

<p>But we can make a similar argument from a more bottom-up standpoint. Inclusion within and exclusion from the ‘Han’ label could be deeply tied in with political and social interests. For example, the Tanka people of southern China (or Danjia in Mandarin) were not, by the Ming period, meaningfully linguistically or ethnically distinct from their neighbours in Guangdong or Fujian, but while not excluded from the Han label outright, they were nevertheless classified as distinct from the label of <em>min</em>, a somewhat ambiguous term best translated as a ‘person of full competence’. The reason for this was that the Tanka failed to satisfy certain criteria: they did not own property ashore, and in particular did not maintain graveyards. With the veneration of one’s ancestors being so deeply embedded in Han cultural norms, the lack of recognisable burial practices was a particular point of difference to grab onto. But identity as Tanka could be shed – albeit over the course of a couple of generations – by managing to purchase land and adopt a sedentary lifestyle, giving an opportunity for the better-off – particularly those who were able to accrue wealth through coastal trading – to secure a position within the locally-dominant ethnic group. This is not the only case of this kind of fluidity in identity at the fringes of the Han group, but it’s perhaps the most salient example.</p>

<p>Secondly, Han identity was often defined in opposition to a construed external Other rather than purely on its own merits. We see this for instance in the case of the Ming, whose categorisation of the Han was simultaneously both expansive and restrictive: expansive in the sense that it sought to encompass both halves of the ‘ethnic Chinese’ supergroup that had been bifurcated by the Jin and latterly the Yuan, but restrictive in that in so doing, it excluded the various Inner Asian peoples that had formed part of the social and cultural fabric of northern China for centuries. The realignment of ‘Han’ with what might be termed an ‘ethnic’ in-group was in many ways a Ming construction, and it was one that emerged out of a deliberate move towards what some have termed a ‘de-Mongolification’ of Chinese institutions and society towards an invented autochthonous ideal. The Han were Han not just because they shared a common written language, certain basic cultural practices like ancestor worship, and a broadly similar socioeconomic base in the form of sedentary agrarianism, but also because these things they shared were things <em>not</em> shared by people who were construed as non-Han. Exclusion also characterised late Qing discourses of ethnicity as Han nationalism emerged as a force to challenge the Manchu-led pluralism of the Qing state: ethnocentric writers like Zhang Binglin and Liang Qichao seized on various forms of racial invective – the former more than the latter, to be sure – and emphasised Han distinctness from their Manchu overlords. The period leading up to the 1911 Revolution would be characterised in large part by specifically acts emphasising Han nativism, with the most visible being defiance of the Qing’s court edicts mandating that Han men adopt Manchu hairstyles.</p>

<p>Finally, as the answers linked earlier go into in more detail, Han identity as a modern construction is an intentionally somewhat expansive one. Just as the Yuan took over Jin and Song definitions of ethnic categorisation, the Qing largely took over what had been an already somewhat reified conception of Han identity from the Ming. The 18th century saw the Qing court, particularly under the Qianlong Emperor, emphasise a stronger reification of the boundaries between Han and other groups, such as through the large-scale (though incomplete) dissolution of the Han Banners, who existed ambiguously between Han and Manchu. Anti-Qing movements of the 19th century tended to find themselves quickly adopting a relatively broad-tent approach despite often being led by members of marginalised Han subgroups. The Taiping leadership was dominated by Hakkas, but took a broadly pan-Han stance very early on, specifically championing Han self-rule and the end of Manchu domination. Sun Yat-Sen, who similarly called for Han majority rule, was a Hakka. Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei, the constitutionalist leaders who tried to dismantle the Manchu state from within in 1898, were Cantonese. These people saw no contradiction between holding an overarching Han identity and a sub-identity within that, but more importantly their political goals were suited by having as many people as possible included while still rejecting the Manchus. This in turn explains the later rhetorical shift that Liang and Sun underwent, as they moved towards the notion of a multiethnic nation that was nevertheless Han-dominated: the ideal was to be as inclusive as possible while still retaining some kind of conceptual boundary that made holding these individual identities relevant, and while also continuing to vilify the Qing state over its ethnic policy. For Chinese nationalists, China would be a sort of ‘national empire’ or ‘imperial nation’ – the Han, as the numerical supermajority, would bind together a disparate group of ethnicities under a single national umbrella. We could, if we wanted to, take this same model down a layer: the Han would, itself, be a composite entity with a certain idalise, albeit one with somewhat stronger cultural ties between its constituent parts.</p>

<p>Han identity, like any other comparable identity, is one that is essentially artificial, but that it is artificial does not make it meaningless. The only real criteria for an ethnic identity to exist is for people to hold it, and in the case of the Han, that criterion is largely satisfied, at least within mainland China. At the global level however, things are more complicated: the political dynamics that have shaped Han identity in China have been, quite obviously, local ones, and so the conception of Han ethnicity, or just Chinese identification in general, is quite different in the case of diaspora communities, and of Sinitic areas outside the PRC ‘core’ such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. In such communities, identity distinctions below the Han super-label can be much more pressing: consider anti-mainlander sentiments in Hong Kong or the continued insularity of some Hakka communities, or the <em>waishengren</em> vs <em>benshengren</em> divide on Taiwan. Weird as it may be to say, China does not have a monopoly on Chineseness, and we ought not to universalise the PRC’s construction of ethnicity.</p>

<p>In essence I’m just referring to ethnic and national identities as a whole. Britishness is artificial, and so too is Frenchness or Germanness, and I mean that in the sense that these were constructed by humans, often relatively recently, rather than being essential, inherent, or continuous.</p>

<p>I would not. As I lay out pretty overtly in pretty much all of the paragraphs, Han identity has been consistently malleable in response to the conditions created by political discontinuities, <em>especially</em> as a result of the period of political division during the Song-Liao-Jin era. If anything it is an attempt to <em>assert</em> rather than to affirm political unity.</p>

<p>Numismatics news!

<p>So, two things, one in agreement and one in disagreement. The disagreement is that, as Erin Horakova’s article <a href="http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/columns/freshly-rememberd-kirk-drift/">Kirk Drift</a> gets into, Kirk’s womanising is actually a fanonical invention that ascended into semi-canon status within the films, rather than being original to TOS. The agreement comes from bringing up Season 2, Episode 13, ‘Obsession’, an episode which was directly inspired by <em>MobyDick</em>, but casts <em>Kirk</em> in the role of Ahab, in relentless pursuit of a cloudlike entity that killed members of his old crew. Viewed in light of that episode, <em>Wrath of Khan</em> serves as inversion as well as deconstruction, putting Kirk in the position of the hunted.</p>

<p>It’s slightly but not hugely complicated. Nijisanji’s Axia Krone had been on hiatus since August, having been, it seems, increasingly at odds with his viewers. He posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGvMKhAHEGw">this rant</a> (solely in Japanese unfortunately), in which he made clear that he was not happy with how viewers in chat seemed to be treating him like parents would treat a rebellious teen, and that he was weirded out by it. Today, he announced that he had privately graduated (i.e. retired) on 30 November, essentially citing creative differences (the more precise wording is along the lines that his own interests and the company’s direction were misaligned), and that his accounts would go private on 7 December. It’s not entirely clear if the graduation announcement essentially extended out of the hiatus announcement or if there were additional behind-the-scenes issues during the hiatus that led to him escalating from hiatus to outright departure.</p>

<p>For a little further background context, Axia was part of the unit Eden-Gumi, who debuted as a group in July 2021. Eden-Gumi has been pretty successful by mainstream VTuber standards, but this came with a fair share of controversy over apparent favouritism in terms of merch and promotions vis-a-vis less popular but more established members (something that also came up during the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uq7vr6/hobby_scuffles_week_of_may_16_2022/i9bb731/?context=999">Luxiem/Noctyx merch drama</a> early this year). One other Eden-Gumi member, Lauren Iroas, has also been a bit of a drama magnet: he was the subject of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v0cylk/hobby_scuffles_week_of_may_30_2022/iavjjy0/">nipple teasing porn piracy debacle</a> and also fell in hot water over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/v64f8h/w_w_w_w_weekly_discussion_thread_june_6th_2022/ibuq2xl/">using an ethnic slur on stream</a>. It’s possible the sort of controversy by association contributed to the hiatus, but it’s not necessarily so; just thought it was worth including as Eden-Gumi has not been the most unacrimonious of units.</p>

  <p>This is a huge overstepping of boundaries - most vtubers keep their private lives private for very important reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would contend, personally at least, that while doing that kind of digging is an overstepping, it’s not necessarily a gigantic one – the major overstepping is not keeping the information to yourself once you have it. VTubing is a pseudonymous and not an anonymous activity, and especially with bigger agency VTubers, finding someone’s prior online activities can be very easy. But despite this – or even because of it – a general policy of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ prevails, and just because you may have been curious to find out for yourself does not entitle you to go out shouting that info out into the open.</p>

<p>That works on some level, but I feel like that you will very quickly get an emergent implicit contract: if you are a fanartist, you go in with the understanding that if you post your art, it will have a chance of being used by the depicted creator with no material return. The only difference would be an explicit invitation to produce free content in Jaiden’s case versus an implicit one in holo’s, but I don’t think this is particularly significant: Holo is still essentially soliciting volunteer labour from fans in exchange for no monetary reward, just in a more open-ended way.</p>]]></content><author><name>EnclavedMicrostate</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-11-21~2022-11-27的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-25/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-11-21~2022-11-27的言论" /><published>2022-11-25T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-11-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-25/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-25/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

Standalone questions are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth">intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers</a>, and we ask that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts">questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts</a> be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/">please see this Rules Roundtable</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you didn’t mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the ‘Short Answers’ thread would be “Who won the 1932 election?” or “What are some famous natural disasters from the past?”. Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be “How did FDR win the 1932 election?”, or “In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?” If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/">Rules Roundtable</a> on asking better questions.</p>

<p>Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we’re letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as ‘Why didn’t X do Y’ relatively often don’t get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, ‘why didn’t X do Y’ questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It’s worth remembering that people in the past couldn’t see into the future, and they generally didn’t have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn’t necessarily look that way at the time.</p>

<p>If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/">consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen</a> (rather than why what didn’t happen didn’t happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>—– <strong>931.1</strong> —–2022-11-16 23:10:06+08:00:</p>

<p>There were in fact many Tê families in Fujian (also, and more commonly these days, known by the Mandarin transcription Zheng), with the one I discussed in that answer being the lineage of one Zheng Shaozu, a local government clerk. One of his sons, Zheng Zhilong, who was born in 1604, took to sea at the age of 18, and became part of the fabric of maritime East Asia. His first journey was with a merchant who took him to Hirado in Japan, where he would base himself for the next couple of years. While there, he married a local woman, Tagawa Matsu, with whom he had three children, the oldest being a son, Zheng Sen, who was born in 1624.</p>

<p>In that year, Zheng Zhilong began what would become his primary calling, piracy. The Dutch East India Company had recently established a colony in southern Taiwan, and were eager for any help they could get. After a brief stint as a translator, Zhilong became a privateer for the Dutch, and rapidly established himself as one of the major players in the South China Sea, commanding supposedly as many as 400 ships by 1727 (yes, that’s just three years into the job). The next year, however, he switched allegiances: after defeating the Ming fleet, Zheng was, like many pirate captains in the late imperial period, offered a position of authority and invited to privateer for the Ming instead – in essence, the pirates became the navy. He secured his reputation when he defeated a Dutch fleet in 1633, and became probably the most powerful man in Fujian in the years following.</p>

<p>This would become particularly pertinent after the collapse of the Ming in 1644 and the subsequent invasion of China by the Manchus. Several cadet branches of the Ming ruling house claimed to be the legitimate continuation of the deposed court in Beijing, and this loose assembly of successor states, known collectively as the ‘Southern Ming’, would hold out well past the Manchus’ arrival in the north. While the Yellow and Yangtze River valleys had been taken over quite quickly, these remnants in the more mountainous south were able to put up at least a semblance of a defence. Well, mostly. Fujian did not, as in 1646, Zheng Zhilong declared for the Qing and allowed the Manchus into the provincial capital of Fuzhou. If Zheng expected all his forces to follow his lead, though, he was mistaken. Zhu Yujian, the self-styled Longwu Emperor, who had been enthroned in Fujian with Zheng Zhilong’s support the year before, retained considerable support from the rest of the Zheng family, especially Zheng Sen, who was an especial favourite of the pretender emperor. He was granted the use of a new personal name, Chenggong, and the slightly esoteric honorary title Guoxingye, ‘grandfather of the imperial surname’. Pronounced Kok-sèng-iâ in Fujianese Hokkien, the Europeans’ transcription of it as ‘Koxinga’ gave us the name by which he is best known in the Western world.</p>

<p>Koxinga refused to follow his father in supporting the Qing, and, with control over his father’s fleet and army, pledged his allegiance to a succession of short-lived Southern Ming emperors, all the while entertaining plans of launching a campaign to reclaim parts of China from the Manchus. In 1656 he attempted to make his decisive play by attacking Nanjing, but the siege proved a costly failure and he withdrew from the region. With Qing forces closing on his coastal strongholds, Koxinga fomented a new plan: in the closing months of 1661, he assembled a force to sail across the Taiwan Strait and seize control of the Dutch colony in the south. Following a ten-month siege of Fort Zeelandia, the Dutch garrison surrendered, and Taiwan fell under the control of the Ming loyalists. Koxinga briefly contemplated an attack on the Spanish Philippines, but died of malaria in June 1662, these plans unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Zheng’s children continued his work on Taiwan, and the Qing watched closely, aware they could not afford to allow an alternative locus of power to exist for too long. This was especially the case in light of the Qing’s administrative arrangement in southern China, where they had split the region into three ‘feudatories’ ruled by the families of men who had defected to the Qing: the Wu family had Yunnan and Guizhou, the Geng family received Fujian and Zhejiang, and the Shang family received Guangdong and Guangxi. The Zheng family, at this time, still held onto a stretch of land around Chaozhou (Teochew), straddling the Guangdong-Fujian border. The feudatory lords were never entirely trusted by the Qing, and especially not the Kangxi Emperor, who formally acceded as a child in 1661 but would not come into his own until 1669; the reduction of the Zheng stronghold on Taiwan, the last vestige of the Southern Ming, was thus of especial importance in case the feudatory lords should reconsider their allegiances. In order to starve the Taiwan regime of raiding targets either at sea or on land, in 1661 the Qing instituted what was known as the Great Clearance, a policy of forced resettlement which prohibited anyone from residing within 50 <em>li</em> (around 25km) of the coast in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangnan, and Shandong. While this policy was lifted again in 1669, that it had ever been in place at all is indicative of how seriously the Qing saw the regime on Taiwan as a threat.</p>

<p>To counter the Taiwanese threat, the Qing began a programme of naval expansion in 1662. The head of this programme was Shi Lang, one of Zheng Zhilong’s principal lieutenants. Shi had not joined Zhilong in surrendering in 1646, but instead had been cast out by Koxinga following a dispute in 1651. With Shi Lang supervising a major programme of shipbuilding and crew training, by 1683 the Qing could boast 300 warships manned by some 20,000 sailors and support crew. During this time, the three feudatory states revolted, though not all at once: Wu Sangui revolted in 1673, Geng Jingzhong revolted in 1674 after taking over from his father, and Shang Zhixin in Guangdong only revolted after Geng Jingzhong had been subdued in 1676. The involvement of Zheng Jing, who landed troops in Fujian in support of Geng Jingzhong in 1676, affirmed Qing fears over Taiwan, and so after the suppression of the revolt in 1681, Taiwan became a top priority. In 1683, the Qing ordered Shi Lang to destroy the Zheng fleet and subdue the Zheng regime, which was achieved in quite short order – helped along considerably by a storm which damaged the Taiwanese fleet in the Pescadores before the main battle, and infighting within the Zheng camp after the battle over whether to surrender or continue resistance.</p>

<p>At the time I wrote that answer, I had been led to believe, by commonly-held assumptions in the scholarship, that the Qing stopped really concerning themselves with naval matters after 1683. This turns out not to be entirely true. While the Qing didn’t build a major ocean-going fleet, they were very much interested in attempting to police piracy and shore up coastal defence, and so although there would be no major programmes of shipbuilding, there was plenty of maintenance and replacement going on to keep the anti-pirate fleets at least somewhat up to shape, as well as considerable fortification works to defend against hypothetical amphibious attacks, such as from the major pirate conglomerations that harried the late Ming. Nevertheless, this was evidently not quite enough to deal with the major confederation that emerged in the south at the turn of the nineteenth century.</p>

However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists and the like, based on past experience: some people working on creative projects have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what’s needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it’s not always what you want to hear.</p>

<p>Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you’re asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don’t know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.</p>

During the 300 years of The Ming Dynasty, why did the Chinese military doctrine not evolve to effectively deal with nomadic cavalry tactics?</a>, submitted on 2022-11-18 14:30:35+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>934.1</strong> —–2022-11-18 17:36:25+08:00:</p>

<p>This question I think has just a few too many flaws to be answered as phrased. The thing is, the Manchus <em>did</em> have technological advantages over their 13th century forebears, just not in the 16th century phase of their expansion. The Ming <em>did</em> innovate technologically, but the Manchus represented a somewhat different kind of threat. I’m a bit strapped for time at the moment so apologies for mainly falling back on old answer links here; if you have more specific follow ups I can try to address them at the weekend.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qfeek7/european_musketeers_did_not_wear_or_wore_only_a/hi2nz27/?context=999">This thread</a> with myself, /u/Otisheet, and /u/JolietJakeLebowski, discusses the Ming-Qing case in particular, and as I note there, after an initial phase in which the Qing were able to overcome Ming gunpowder advantages with superior mobility and knowledge of terrain, there came to be a protracted stalemate in the late 1620s and early 1630s as the Ming adapted their tactics to optimally deal with the Manchus, while the Manchus built up their own gunpowder arm through the <em>ujen cooha</em>, or ‘heavy troops’.</p>

<p>It is worth also noting, as I do in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h108o3/how_did_the_qing_manage_to_subjugate_the_mongols/ftqjjeu/?context=999">this comment</a>, that the Manchus were not nomadic, and their tactical and operational approach differed somewhat as a result, even if they were superficially similar.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of takeaways from Kenneth Swope’s book on the Imjin War that I think would be worth considering. Firstly, there were clear logistical limits on Ming military commitment in Northeast Asia – as true for Manchuria in the 1610s-30s as it was for Korea in the 1590s. There was only so much that could be funnelled through the Shanhai Pass to supplement local resources, and that meant that in the period up to about 1636 when the proto-Qing state was simply securing Manchuria, they were fighting a very limited segment of the Ming army. Secondly, the Ming military had a certain degree of regional specialisation: the northern armies were mainly set up to deal with nomadic cavalry, while the southern coastal armies were set up to deal with ‘Japanese’ pirates (who often weren’t Japanese, but were still pirates), typically armed with firearms as well as cold arms. What was discovered during the Imjin War was that the Ming armies in the north were really bad at dealing with gunpowder-heavy, infantry-based armies like those of the Japanese, and so the rotation of southern troops was an especial priority. While there had been organisational change since the 1590s, it lends credence to the idea that the Ming valued specialisation over flexibility in tactical doctrine at the regional level, and the adaptations that had taken place since that period may not have left the Ming armies well equipped to deal with the more hybrid tactics the Manchus adopted.</p>

<p>Finally of course, the actual collapse of the Ming came from within following revolts in 1644 with which the Manchus had virtually zero involvement. The Qing conquest of China was not a clash between a Ming Goliath and a Qing David, but rather a mopping-up campaign by the Qing, who had the largest and best organised army, against a series of fractured polities – one that did ultimately get bogged down for over a decade in southwest China against Ming remnants that got their act together. What the Qing ended up doing was not, by any means, an immediate steamroll of Asia’s premier power.</p>

<p>I feel like there’s a lot of baked-in assumptions and stereotyping and this is undoubtedly the biggest one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byYQs4oG_gk">This</a> is not a squeaky anime child voice, nor are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ66b9DhkGE">these</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc7pITQqdWY">this</a> isn’t, nor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_fRRQqYLJU">this</a>, nor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTcAsP23BfA">this</a>. And that’s just examples from Hololive. Take Nijisanji’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIM96RaLJeg">Selen</a> or indie VTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/LfWqHl55Ilk?t=3556">Iida Pochi</a>. I’m not going to insist that you have to like VTubers now, but the notion that it’s all apparently squeaky voices is a massive generalisation.</p>

<p>So Cover should lie publicly?</p>

<p>Look, in a situation like this in which one of your streamers is literally going to stop streaming for 2 weeks with absolutely no warning, you have four options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell all – very likely to backfire because it reflects badly on all parties.</li>
  <li>Divulge as much as is required – opens some speculation but fundamentally gets across the basic message.</li>
  <li>Lie to the public – papers it over but if anyone outside finds out or anyone internal leaks, then it demonstrates <em>you have lied to the public</em>.</li>
  <li>Say absolutely nothing – encourages rampant speculation over the sudden and random break someone took without announcement.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t know, maybe a company can’t afford to casually lie to its customers and potential investors?</p>

<p>—– <strong>935.8</strong> —–2022-11-22 17:26:16+08:00:</p>

<p>I don’t know what to tell you, but you’re describing nigh-on nonexistent situations here. Did someone who signed up to a rigorous training program not end up having worked for it when they made it big? How much work counts as enough before you’re allowed a lucky break? Are brands not allowed to promote anyone? Because if so then the Beatles are the ultimate grifters by that definition.</p>

<p>In any event, it’s not even like most VTuber companies are promoting total non-entities. Despite the nominal commitment to anonymity, VTubers’ past on the internet can be pretty traceable, and at both major agencies (Hololive and Nijisanji) new talents are invariably existing content creators, some more popular and some more obscure. So I don’t know what the issue is. Is it that already-popular creators are getting a boost from the branding and that’s bad because…???? Or is it that obscure creators are getting a boost from the branding and that’s bad because…????</p>

<p>Quality of mouth tracking can definitely be variable, and there’s four (sort of three) potential points of failure: is the rigging high enough quality to interpret the inputs properly, is the camera good enough to produce high-quality inputs (i.e. sensitive enough but not over-sensitive), is the streamer positioned optimally relative to the camera, and do they talk in a way that makes it easy for the whole setup to pick up (relatively significant mouth movements, not speaking too quickly, etc)? There are some examples of slicker tracking though: Froot and Silvervale stand out off the top of my head.</p>

<p>这就是最大问题，人们可能会后知后觉，但若防疫彻底放开且大面积感染在未来成真（希望不会，但……），那么多防疫带来的经济停滞、失业以及死亡，一切的苦难都没有任何意义。</p>

<p>他们只想着堵，不想着堵不住了如何做下一步缓冲，三年时间都根本没有做任何医疗系统上全面加强。</p>

<p>共存从实际角度来讲，经济和财政，与外部世界的互动都是无可避免的，所以更要做好内部对疫情大面积感染的解决机制。</p>

<p>结果吃苦三年，浪费三年，不止是今年白折腾，这三年没有用最后窗口期去加紧改革医疗系统，去预备更多呼吸道或并发症所需的庞大基础医疗资源，出了事既要全民买三年经济停滞的单，还要买之后多年大规模感染的单。</p>

<p>加速是毫无疑问的，但未必会成为压死骆驼的最后一根稻草。</p>

<p>现在是一堆稻草将至，不知道哪根最重，哪一根是最后一个。</p>

<p>地方政府在基层维稳要花钱，钱是衡量状况的稳定指标，地方政府没钱就什么都管不了，有钱就大概率能撑过去，所以房地产带来的压力可能更大，因为直接事关全社会的经济和生产状况，尤其是地方政府的主要收入来源。</p>

<p>从过往经验看，中共实际现在除了部分规划好的长远计划外，对以月为单位的中短期临时事件处理能力是非常差的。</p>

<p>疫情彻底放开，经济会活跃起来，大环境虽然不好，但能续一下，可能会冲淡来自于疫情的大量死亡和医疗资源挤兑。</p>

<p>也就是说，可能留下极大量的埋怨与长期负面印象，政治舆论环境也很糟糕。</p>

<p>但是多数人得以生产工作，对比被原子化的个人埋怨，有可能会压过去，只会变成一个长期诟病被记很久的历史事件。</p>

<p>虽然不排除说因为医院资源挤兑，很多人在医院闹，最后逐渐变成大问题的现象，但维稳主要靠钱，生产恢复后，经济收益拿大头的是政府，这时候他们维稳的资金肯定不少（当然现在也够），处理问题哪怕慢，也是可能压得下来的。</p>

<p>未来允许中共会变成不要脸皮就对国内尬吹，说什么都没人信，舆论上的支持者越来越少，到最后因为财政优势，维稳下没人能物理推翻，互联网上人人道路以目各种阴阳怪气。</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Christopher K. Johnson, President and CEO of China Strategies Group, a political risk consultancy, and a Senior Fellow at the Asia Society’s Center for China Analysis.]</p>

<p>China’s president is a ruthless and tenacious leader, full of ambitions that will not be subordinated by norms: something the reformist Hu Jintao’s embarrassing and forced exit from the congress meeting clearly illustrated. By appointing a mix of loyal protégés and accomplished technocrats to the Politburo, Xi has also made it clear that he is a man in a hurry, pursuing fast results. He could act rashly and catch Washington off guard.<br />
But that does not mean Xi is itching for a fight. In fact, Xi’s very sense that China faces substantial challenges may encourage him to lower bilateral tensions. Ding, a leading Politburo member, unwittingly hinted as much in a lengthy early November article in the People’s Daily, where he forcefully catalogued China’s many challenges and arduous tasks over the next five years (and beyond) and offered a controversial Mao formulation as the right response. It was, after all, Mao who first lowered tensions with Washington in order to more easily achieve many of his objectives. Xi is not looking for a rapprochement, but he might like some breathing room. Early rumblings that Biden and Xi could hold a lengthy meeting with the trappings of traditional modern summits, where both sides use the gathering to announce commercial deals and other deliverable results, certainly suggested as much. The real question is whether Biden wants to—or can—seize Beijing’s apparent interest in a détente to pump the brakes on the relationship’s downward spiral.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2022-11-07~2022-11-13的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-13/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2022-11-07~2022-11-13的言论" /><published>2022-11-13T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-11-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-13/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-13/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>Rule 5: The combined total of votes across all interest groups is something like 4x my voting population, but also the only party that will actually get these votes is the Nazis led by the Armed Forces. So that’s… interesting.</p>

<p>I believe that that’s the Radical Party symbol. As for your second question, parties cause all Interest Groups within them to be counted as one, so you don’t get the legitimacy penalty that comes with having more than one group in government.</p>

<p>They join these parties if they have common ideological stances, either inherently or because of their leaders. So in this case, all five of the Interest Groups shown were either inherently or temporarily Radical, and were thus willing to join under that banner. If you unlock the option to have an Anarchist party, the Trade Unions might split off to form that, for instance.</p>

<p>—– <strong>916.1</strong> —–2022-11-09 18:56:48+08:00:</p>

<p>The notion that the Great Wall contains human bodies is an interesting one, and goes in some unexpected directions.</p>

<p>First, because it bears mentioning, when we use the phrase ‘Great Wall’ we are potentially referring to two separate concepts. The first is the rather clumsy colloquial use of the term to describe <em>every</em> frontier wall built by a Sinitic state (plus also the Mongolic Khitan Liao and the Tungusic Jurchen Jin), much though not all of which are now eroded beyond recognition; the second is specifically the largely-extant wall built in stages by the Ming between about 1470 and 1570. The issue is that there is a tendency to compress all of these into a single entity, but as I go into in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wb8na3/when_it_comes_to_the_great_wall_of_china_what_is/">this answer</a>, even if we do use the phrase ‘Great Wall’ we need to understand that there have been <em>many</em> ‘Great Walls’, both geographically and chronologically discontinuous. So, in turn, there was not simply <em>a</em> construction of the Great Wall, because there have been <em>many</em> constructions, and the tale about human remains refers to the Qin walls of the late 3rd century BCE, and <em>not</em> the extant Ming walls of the 15th and 16th centuries CE.</p>

<p>Under the Han, the walls built by the Qin were portrayed as symbolic of the tyrannical impulses of Qin Shi Huang and his exercise of Legalist philosophy, which in its political form advocated for absolutism and the ultimate power of the state, embodied in the person of the emperor. Per Arthur Waldron, this found its way into two parallel discursive traditions, one elite and one popular, around the construction of the Qin frontier walls. The elite tradition centred on the imperial court, where, according to the Han court historian Sima Qian, Qin Shi Huang’s right-hand man, Meng Tian, was made to commit suicide after the emperor’s death in 210 directly due to the wall construction. In the brief monologue Sima Qian has Meng Tian deliver before taking the fatal poison, he states that in building ramparts from Lintao to Liaodong, he must have cut across the veins of the earth, this being his capital crime. Sima Qian himself, however, regarded Meng Tian’s principal crime as his repeated conscription of labour and callous disregard for public welfare, but even then that was intimately tied with the massive mobilisation of labour towards wall construction.</p>

<p>The popular vein focussed on how wall-building affected the local populace on a much more intimate level. Folk songs around the Qin walls became commonplace, with one song warning parents to abandon sons at birth as they would only end up suffering and dying as conscripted labour at the foot of the wall, and to celebrate the birth of daughters instead. This verse would be incorporated into a number of later ballads by elite writers. But it is important to note that the bodies lay <em>outside</em> the wall, not <em>in</em> it, in this telling.</p>

<p>The story of bodies being <em>in</em> the wall relates to the legend of Lady Meng Jiang, a pretty famous tale in Chinese folklore, and one with a complex history. Its earliest form comes in a 4rd century BCE text, the <em>Zuo zhuan</em> (or <em>Commentary of Zuo</em>), which, yes, <em>predates</em> the Qin-era wall constructions. It is also incredibly brief, and consists solely of the statement that the anonymous widow of Qi Liang insisted that ritual propriety be observed by the state that had sent him to war. The connection with a wall – of any sort – was added by the Han scholar Liu Xiang ca. 18 BCE in the <em>Lienü zhuan</em> (<em>Biographies of Exemplary Women</em>), who states that she wept over her husband’s corpse at the foot of the city wall, which collapsed ten days later. Note that this was merely the wall of her city, not a frontier wall. Folk narratives around bodies being buried in frontier walls emerged during the Northern and Southern period (typically defined as 420-589 CE but some have stretched the term back to begin with the Three Kingdoms period starting in 220), when fortification was especially prolific and mortality was high. Only during the Tang period (618-907) do we see the older legend of Lady Meng Jiang (who also only began going by this name around this time) merge with much later motifs of mortality in building frontier walls, to produce the modern folk tale in which it was the Qin wall specifically that actually contained human bodies.</p>

<p>As an aside, it is worth stressing, as u/itsallfolklore is wont to do, that the notion that folklore must contain a grain of truth is itself folklore. When I (well, technically Arthur Waldron as summarised by me) say that stories circulated about bodies buried in frontier walls, that does not mean that there were bodies, only that there were stories. We cannot definitively disprove that there may have been, but even if so the folk tales would be correct only by coincidence.</p>

<p>The chronological compression of Great Walls is not a novel development, and indeed even the Ming walls, soon after they were built, found parts of the Meng Jiang myth projected on them. In the late 15th century, the fortifications at Shanhaiguan were alleged to have originally been built by the Qin and restored by the Ming (they were not; the Qin frontier was further north), and to have been where Meng Jiang found her husband, and one of the towers was dubbed the ‘husband-watching-tower’ as being the place from which she tried to spot him in the crowd. A shrine to Meng Jiang would be established (or possibly re-established) in the area in 1594, tying the Tang myth around the Qin wall into the Ming wall of the then-present.</p>

<p>For further reading, the definitive treatment of the Great Wall in English remains Arthur Waldron’s <em>The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth</em> (1989).</p>

<p>So, the unfortunate answer is we don’t really have a good sense of it, at least not at the scholarship level. And there are a few reasons for this. Firstly, operational military history has not had as much interest from historians of China as it has for histories of warfare in other contexts. Secondly, the Chinese historiographical tradition is not as tactically detailed as the European. European historians until the last century or two came from a background in which the elite served both military and civil functions, whereas for much of Chinese history, warfare and the martial sphere were considered beneath the literati elite. That is not to say we do not have some degree of detailed operational history for large parts of Chinese military history, but the focus of our sources tends to be somewhat elsewhere. I am certain we <em>could</em> reconstruct the Taiping War in terms of operational and tactical history from the sources we have, but as it stands, nobody really has done yet. Arguably the closest we get is from Jen Yu-Wen, who gives a decent accounting of campaigns in <em>The Taiping Revolutionary Movement</em>, but he really doesn’t cover <em>battles</em> in depth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I may not be of much help here. For one I’m in grad school now and don’t have the same level of time or energy to devote to writing something totally original as an answer on the sub these days, and for another there is a source issue here, as surviving Taiping sources are light on tactical detail compared to Qing sources, and while the former isn’t too hard to muddle through, unfortunately my grasp of 19th century high-register clerical Chinese is something still being worked on, and I simply don’t have the necessary time and energy to work through these sources at the moment. What I will do, however, is point you to a few English-language sources that may be of help in at least getting a partial sense of the ‘face of battle’ in the Taiping conflict.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Stephen R. Platt’s <em>Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom</em> is a relatively ‘big picture’ account, but it does include a decent amount of campaign and battle detail, just not a lot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Augustus Lindley’s <em>Ti-Ping Tien-Kwoh</em> (1866) is both a history of the Taiping and a personal narrative, the latter of which encompasses a few field battles Lindley personally participated in on the Taiping side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Andrew Wilson’s <em>The Ever-Victorious Army</em> (1868) is a triumphalist account of the Ever-Victorious Army under Charles Gordon, one which must be read with a mountain of salt, but which as an operational history should be at least decent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prosper Giquel’s <em>A Journal of the Chinese Civil War, 1864</em>, translated by Stephen Leibo in 1985, is about the Ever-Triumphant Army, officially the Franco-Chinese Corps of Zhejiang, which was the French equivalent of the Ever-Victorious Army. Giquel doesn’t go into huge tactical detail but he does have some material.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A major caveat to the above sources is that they mostly concentrate on European or European-led units in the eastern theatre of the war, rather than the larger confrontations between the Taiping and the Hunanese militia in the west. Platt tries to balance between the two ends, and Lindley does record one or two confrontations further up the Yangtze to be fair, but be very aware that the focus here skews eastward towards the European-involved part of the fighting, rather than the more ‘peer’ conflict in the west.</p>

<p>So, <del>three</del> four suggestions, of varying levels of practicality:</p>

<p>The first is to suggest not having a distinct colouration for China Proper vs other parts of the Qing Empire. That’s not to say that the Qing should be treated as a homogeneous, ‘flat’ entity, but by having China’s colour more saturated it implies a certain Sinocentrism when the Qing was itself a distinctly multi-constituent formation.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Qing only controlled the west coast of Taiwan at this time. A quick browse of Qing-era maps like the ones <a href="https://qingmaps.org/">here</a> will show that the interior was unmapped and beyond state control, at this time still being ruled by independent indigenous polities.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Japan was not really a singular entity: a gander at <a href="https://t.co/VkPyRIBKFV">this article</a>, which summarises the goals of the still-ongoing Digital Atlas of Tokugawa Japan, ought to reveal the serious complexity of the internal structures of rule during the Edo bakufu – in essence, Japan was less a unitary state than an unequal federation of states under Tokugawa hegemony.</p>

<p>Looking specifically at the Pearl River Delta for a sec, there are places here that should be marked and places here that should not. In 1802, Hong Kong and Shenzhen did not meaningfully exist; on the flip-side, Macau is an absolutely vital inclusion that is very noticeable by its absence. Looking northward for a sec, there are plenty of ahistorical Russian place names in still-Qing-held Manchuria. I assume part of this is because of the WIP issue, but still, worth flagging.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexander had been fascinated by the Homeric epics since boyhood; one of his first acts after crossing into Asia Minor had been to visit the supposed site of Troy and reenact the funeral games of Patroclus. His former tutor Aristotle had composed or commissioned a special edition of the Iliad, which Alexander brought with him to Asia (Plutarch, Alexander 8.2; 26.2). We don’t know whether this was a full edition of the poem or a “greatest hits” compilation focused on Achilles, Alexander’s favorite character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth stressing that Alexander’s affinity for the Homeric epics is questionable on some counts. While all the main literary sources on Alexander include some degree of Homeric imagery, I think it is instructive that the only one they concur on is his decision to hold rites on arriving at Troy. Only Plutarch claims he quoted the <em>Odyssey</em> when founding Alexandria on the Nile; only Arrian likens his relationship with Hephaistion to Achilles and Patroklos, or draws directly on the Iliad to get into Alexander’s headspace; only Diodoros has him invoking Achilles at the Hydaspes; and only Curtius has Alexander order the governor of Gaza to be dragged round the wall by hooks through his ankles. There’s an argument to be made (in my view a strong one) that we ought to read the rites at Troy as an act of political cynicism during the more pan-Hellenic, pre-Gaugamela phase of Alexander’s career, and to essentially regard other Homeric references in the Alexander sources as largely later interpolations.</p>

<p>Back to the original point at hand, though, it must be granted that the claim Alexander slept with an Aristotle-commissioned copy of the <em>Iliad</em> is reasonably well-supported within Plutarch, who explicitly cites Onesikritos (possibly referring to the <em>Education of Alexander</em>); that said, Plutarch’s assertion that ‘many trustworthy authorities’ attest to his storing it in a cask left behind at Issos is much tricker to accept at face value. One would have thought he’d be willing to let us know who these authorities were…</p>

<p>You’ve hit the nail on the head there: Alexander seems to have felt a pressing need to actually perform Greekness because of an awareness that this was not actually taken for granted by his allies, many of whom had seen his father Philip as a marauding barbarian and would not have suddenly forgotten it the moment his son came to power.</p>

<p>—– <strong>923.1</strong> —–2022-11-13 05:28:55+08:00:</p>

<p>Aristotle’s education of Alexander is recounted principally by two ancient authors (whose work survives): Plutarch and Diogenes Laertios. If you want to really get into a load of epistemological weeds and a bunch of philosophical musing about what it means to ‘know’ anything, then sure, we don’t <em>know</em> Aristotle tutored Alexander, but by conventional methodology the weight of evidence is pretty clear that Aristotle was Alexander’s tutor and they shared a reasonably close bond.</p>

<p>Aristotle met Alexander because he had been hired as his tutor by Alexander’s father, Philip II, in 343/2 BCE. This is where Plutarch starts things as regards Aristotle in the <em>Life of Alexander</em>, but Diogenes Laertios gives us a little more backstory. His short biography of Aristotle, citing the lost <em>Lives</em> of the mid-3rd century biographer Hermippos of Smyrna, suggests that Aristotle had been part of an Athenian embassy to the Philip’s court, and had been there in an official capacity. Whether this is necessarily true is a little unclear; what we do know is he had departed Athens around the time of his teacher Plato’s death in 348/7, and he seems to have hung around Asia Minor for a time before Philip sent his invitation. However, his connections with the Macedonian court actually went back further: his family was not from Athens but rather Stageira in the Chalkidike, and his father, Nikomachos, was the court physician of Philip’s father, Amyntas III. We don’t know if Aristotle lived with his father at this time, but it still meant he did actually have a few connections with the royal court to draw upon.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s tutoring of Alexander is not recounted at immense length, but both authors regard it as having been reasonably extensive. As Plutarch put it, ‘the equipment that he had from Aristotle his teacher when he crossed over into Asia was more than what he had from his father Philip’. He singles out two particular areas where Aristotle’s instruction was influential: the first were the ‘acroamatic’ teachings, a rather unclear set of esoteric teachings which, according to an alleged letter from Alexander to his teacher, were instrumental to his manner of rule; the second was an interest in medicine, and Plutarch alleges that Alexander often administered treatment to his sick and wounded friends. He also states that among Alexander’s most prized possessions was an edition of the <em>Iliad</em> that he is supposed to have kept under his pillow, and which he later stored in a jewelled case looted from Darius III’s baggage after the Battle of Issos in 333 (possibly – Plutarch is somewhat evasive about his sources here). There are, however, certain caveats to keep in mind: Plutarch, especially in the early part of the <em>Life of Alexander</em>, seems to point to Alexander’s education by Aristotle as part of his portrayal of Alexander as a Panhellenic hero, by making him out to be a particularly devoted student of one of the most quintessentially Greek philosophers. But the image is more complicated than he makes out, as Plutarch himself would admit.</p>

<p>Around 327, Alexander apparently began – if he had not done so already – to have an increasingly strained relationship with Aristotle, who had returned to Athens before Alexander left for Asia, but with whom it seems he was still corresponding. The ‘conspiracy of the pages’ in 327 saw Hermolaos, one of Alexander’s servants, attempt to assassinate him, and according to Plutarch this event was alleged to have been instigated by Kallisthenes, Aristotle’s great-nephew and one of Alexander’s courtiers. Kallisthenes was placed under arrest and was, in Plutarch’s account, supposed to have been put on trial with Aristotle in attendance when Alexander returned to Greece, but he died of disease while the army was in India. (Diogenes Laertios adds the grisly detail that Kallisthenes may have been thrown to a lion when it became clear he would not survive the journey.) Why exactly Plutarch regards this as a sign of growing hostility is a little unclear, and indeed it doesn’t really have much of a payoff.</p>

<p>There was a persistent rumour in the ancient world that Aristotle had actually been partly responsible for Alexander’s death. Both Plutarch and Arrian include – but dismiss – a narrative in which Aristotle was supposed to have advised Antipatros, Alexander’s governor holding the fort in Macedonia and Greece, to assassinate the king, to unclear ends. Much ink has been spilled over the general credibility of this claim: Aristotle’s involvement is <em>probably</em> fictional, but the claim that there was a murder plot concocted by Antipatros – whose son Iollas was one of Alexander’s cup-bearers – has been treated by some as potentially credible, in spirit if not in practice. Christopher Blackwell’s <em>In the Absence of Alexander</em> makes a reasonably convincing argument for there having been a considerable erosion in Alexander’s authority in Greece, culminating in the effective takeover of that part of the empire by Antipatros, a process rather suddenly derailed by the total fragmentation of the empire anyway in the wake of Alexander’s death. While we cannot prove Antipatros <em>did</em> poison Alexander, it’s oddly plausible that he might have done. Alternatively, this was a claim fabricated entirely by Antipatros’ rivals, such as Alexander’s mother Olympias, as a means of discrediting his pretensions to power, and all of the preceding means nothing at all.</p>

<p>What we do know, from Diogenes Laertios, is that whatever the relationship became by the end, it was, in the ancient world, a pretty well-attested one, with Aristotle’s surviving oeuvre by his day (ca. 200 CE) including a petition to Alexander and four volumes of correspondence with him. Unfortunately, these are simply not quoted or alluded to at length by any of the major literary sources, so our understanding of Aristotle’s influence on Alexander is pretty much limited to the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Aristotle taught Alexander from about 342 (when the latter was 14) for a period of at least half a decade, but was back in Athens by 335;</li>
  <li>The two still corresponded for some time, but we’re not exactly sure when it may have stopped; and</li>
  <li>There seems to have been a recognition that the two were increasingly strained in their relations by the time of the latter’s death, although in what way and on what grounds is not well articulated.</li>
</ol>

<p>A popular narrative is that it was Alexander’s abandonment of Panhellenism in favour of a more universalist, multicultural manner of rule that put off Aristotle, who had counselled a much more ethnocentric policy on Alexander’s part. While Plutarch, in <em>On the Fortune or Virtue of Alexander</em>, does suggest that Alexander differed from his tutor in this regard, there simply isn’t an explicit link in the sources between this political difference and their falling-out, presuming that this falling-out even took place at all.</p>

<p>—– <strong>923.2</strong> —–2022-11-15 07:59:34+08:00:</p>

<p>So, the relative distance between Alexander and the surviving sources is always one to account for, and it’s something I go into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l06m2l/concerning_alexander_the_great_how_much_of_the/gjwy3ha/">here</a>. That said, these later authors weren’t making stuff up: they had their own sources, whom they often cited explicitly. This <em>complicates</em> our view of Alexander, and massively so, but it doesn’t mean we cannot know anything with certainty.</p>

<p>—– <strong>924.1</strong> —–2022-11-13 21:05:02+08:00:</p>

<p>This is a feature of Taiping ideology that was not analysed until comparatively recently, as on the surface it does seem like a mere bit of semantics. But you’re not wrong to point out that there might be something to it beyond that, and thankfully you haven’t been the first to notice.</p>

<p>To cut straight to the chase, the Taiping fundamentally rejected the empire as an institution. Now, when we speak of ‘the Chinese Empire’ it is worth suggesting that we are discussing an ideologically continuous unit rather than a politically or territorially continuous one, and it was very much that ideological dimension to which the Taiping objected. This rejection was based on what Thomas Reilly, in <em>The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</em>, terms ‘the blasphemy of empire’: the notion that the imperial system was fundamentally an affront to God and must, therefore, be cast out in its entirety. The origins of this belief are quite interesting in themselves. While we might connect it with Hong Xiuquan’s personal failings in the imperial examination system, this actually doesn’t have much to back it up, as the Taiping themselves instituted their own examinations very early on. Rather, the core of it appears to have been really quite semantic, and the result of a quirk of textual translation and transmission.</p>

<p>Christian missionaries in China had struggled for some time with how to translate both the word and concept of God into Chinese, and had gone back and forth on a number of points. The term <em>shen</em> 神, while a direct translation of a term for ‘god’ or ‘spirit’, wasn’t seen as quite capturing the full majesty of a supreme monotheistic deity. <em>Tianzhu</em> 天主, literally ‘Lord of Heaven’, ultimately stuck in colloquial use, but its use was actually banned by papal bull in 1715, which interpreted this formulation as implying that God was the lord of Heaven <em>only</em>, as opposed to all creation. <em>Shangdi</em> 上帝, ‘High Sovereign’, was also opposed, but on the basis of having been derived from a term used in the Confucian canon for the head deity of an older, more henotheistic Chinese pantheon, but whose worship had since lapsed. The Protestants, however, were considerably less concerned about linguistic precision than in communicability, and broadly concurred on the use of the name <em>Shangdi</em> for God in their pamphlets and their Bible translations, such as the Gützlaff and Morrison Bibles.</p>

<p>Hong Xiuquan was, as we should well know by this point, reasonably well-educated. While not an accredited scholar above the local examination level, he nevertheless would have had an intimate familiarity with the Neo-Confucian canon, principally the Four Books and Five Classics: the Four Books are discursive philosophical works laying out the core beliefs of Confucianism; the Five Classics are a series of texts covering history, poetry, ritual, and divination, which were to be interpreted through a Confucian lens. And the Five Classics in particular feature, very heavily, the god Shangdi as head of the pantheon, whereas the Four Books do not. Following his revelatory visions in 1837 and his reading of Liang Afa’s <em>Quanshi liangyan</em> 勸世良言 (‘Good Words for Admonishing the Age’) in 1843, Hong came to the realisation that the Shangdi of the Five Classics and the Shangdi of the Protestant Bible were one and the same – a belief that was <em>technically</em> true but not quite in the way he came to see it.</p>

<p>But from that revelation sprang the belief that China had once been a monotheistic society, but that paganism had been introduced at some subsequent stage, with Confucius himself typically being blamed. The Five Classics thus remained canonical, but the Four Books, attributed to Confucius and his disciples, were condemned as corruptive. In turn, the imperial system built on the foundations of Confucian philosophy was irredeemably corrupt, built on heathen foundations. Moreover, the title of <em>Huangdi</em> 皇帝 for ‘Emperor’ was considered blasphemous in appropriating the character <em>di</em> 帝, committing sacrilege against God. As such, the Taiping were to have no emperors, but rather kings (王 <em>wang</em>), who did not impinge upon God’s majesty.</p>

<p>To finally wrap back to the question as phrased, this in turn had implications for how the Taiping described their state. Theirs was specifically the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, hence <em>Tianguo</em> 天囯; it was to herald an age of Great Peace, hence <em>Taiping</em> 太平. It is not mere trivia that the Taiping specifically used a variant character for <em>guo</em>, that being 囯 as opposed to the more standard 國 or the 国 simplification now used in Simplified Chinese. You will notice that the inside character is 王, stressing the importance of humble <em>kingship</em>, rather than blasphemous emperorship, within the state. That said, it is worth adding that the Taiping state did also refer to itself as a <em>Tianchao</em> 天朝, but this gets into a certain complexity with the term <em>chao</em> itself. <em>Chao</em>, in the most general sense, means ‘court’. Its translation into English as ‘empire’ or ‘state’ or ‘dynasty’ tends to be more contextually framed. <em>Chao</em> was rarely if ever used in foreign relations, and most typically referred to the entity of the state within the context of the empire. After all, the Great Qing was simply 大清 <em>da Qing</em>, not 大清天朝 <em>da Qing tianchao</em>. So too for the Taiping, where the term <em>Tianchao</em> was often used in the context of pronouncements on domestic policy, but not to refer to the entirety of the kingdom.</p>

<p>If you’d like to read a bit more into this, Thomas Reilly’s <em>The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Religion and the Blasphemy of Empire</em> is the principal source of this argument; Carl Kilcourse’s <em>Taiping Theology</em> revisits the argument and agrees with some though not all of its core conceits.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1846.1</strong> —–2022-11-11 20:39:00+08:00:</p>

<p>清灭亡前，对整个中国最大的错误，是咸丰死后的辛酉政变直接导致跟日本同期进行西化改革却长期落后，失去东亚地区主导权，并且直接导致日军侵华与长期内战和后续历史。</p>

<p>这个我过去经常提到，实际是个被忽视的历史脉络，咸丰早亡无法施展抱负，肃顺被杀更是引发后来汉人官僚集团失去主心骨。</p>

<p>鬼子六和慈禧，尤其是慈禧，都再也无法跟肃顺一样跨越身份与地位的去团结汉人官僚，因为他们没法以满人主导者身份不顾政治影响去任用汉人，后期很多时候更像是妥协。</p>

<p>肃顺大量提拔汉人，且有早期大中华主义，对新式技术的态度从他提拔的下属可见一斑，任用人才不问民族，清后期执政危机里，一个主要问题就是缺乏政治凝聚力。</p>

<p>除了西化和维新运动，当时拿不出任何可以团结统治阶层与士人集团观点的立场。</p>

<p>清亡的顺序是这样的：太平天国后权力分散，迫切需要洋务运动，导致国内出现改革派与保守派别，但改革派别在统治阶层中枢长期缺乏派系，也没有门第继承关系，让康有为这样的人直接进入权力中枢，而光绪既无对此的了解，也无具备丰富行政经验的臂膀。</p>

<p>最后引发社会观点矛盾分裂，孙文等改良派开始彻底走向革命立场，并且最终导致清朝灭亡。</p>

<p>慈禧在时通过长期对朝政的控制力凝聚保守派，死后受西化影响的北洋派系也不演了，革命压力一加大，越来越多人骑墙跳反。</p>

<p>也就是说辛酉政变直接导致清朝错过完整改革自身，从狭隘民族主义过渡到大中华主义的一个窗口期，最终灭亡于西化影响下的汉民族主义，以及相对应的现代化思想。</p>

<p>可以说慈禧留下了一个烂摊子，只要她死，清朝和革命党都是输家，谁也对付不了谁，最后造成的事实是，地方民主是有了，却是基于混乱而来。</p>

<p>除此之外战争也来了，不止是内部自己人打自己，外部还有日本人虎视眈眈。</p>

<p>慈禧晚年已经意识到这点，从一开始放权出现百日维新，再到后来寻求君主立宪制的考察，都说明慈禧临死前些年的危机感开始大幅度加强，明白到局势已经越来越难被清廷控制。</p>

<p>慈禧杀肃顺，直接导致大量汉人官僚与朝廷关系开始若即若离，从此半个多世纪再也无法做到肃顺时期，既名正言顺以满人身份管理汉人官僚集团，又能不刻意照顾满人利益，相反以满人身份去修正满人集团的内部弊病而不至于站不住脚，相当于满人自己内部出现一个能一碗水端平的平衡角色。</p>

<p>夸张的比喻，汉人群臣就是会随着洋务运动必然成为主体的一条恶犬，唯一能牵绳子的人就是辛酉政变里被杀掉的肃顺，慈禧清除肃顺，导致后期汉人和洋务运动产生的重要政治实体与观点，居然不能被满人为核心的朝廷轻易掌控。</p>

<p>出现东南互保也不敢深究，要知道此时曾国藩死了都快三十年了。</p>

<p>光绪本身的不成熟，也是因为权力中枢一直缺乏一个持续推进西化和大中华化的统治阶层内部集团。</p>

<p>保守派包括荣禄和慈禧在内对变法态度都是积极的，全都后知后觉，在肃顺死后半个世纪意识到满人集团必须改革，但是又没有可以用的现成人才梯队，并且发现康有为这种人根本无法主导行政工作，只能到处演讲为主，最后就是光绪在混乱里选了下下策，试图跟保守派火并获取全部政权而被软禁放弃。</p>

<p>连皇帝都已经这样了，慈禧实际应该已经知道清廷的最后命运，因为此时民间革命者不再是以武逼改，而是以武实现革命。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1846.2</strong> —–2022-11-14 23:59:00+08:00:</p>

<p>洋务运动不是为了集权，是被形式所迫的产物，当时太平天国还没战败呢，咸丰也没死，属于是到关键时刻不得不改了，就跟改革开放一样，左右派都同意要改革。</p>

<p>推动主力来自于地方汉臣集团与部分意识到需要改革的中央满人和内廷人员，基本此时内外廷观点是一致的，后来相当多都继承咸丰末期以肃顺为首的改革观念。</p>

<p>但决策权因为肃顺被杀，鬼子六后来被踢，慈禧有些转向用其言不用其人的驾驶，开始出现中央与地方不齐的问题，也是到慈禧死前，朝中始终没培养出一个能掌控和凝聚内外廷的政治领袖的原因，袁世凯其实也不怎么具备这种影响力。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1846.3</strong> —–2022-11-24 00:23:32+08:00:</p>

<p>肃顺个人能力出色，有改革意识，对满人内部腐朽非常不满，对满人旧制颇有微词，整顿不少，不问汉人与否进行提拔和重用，对有能力的汉人很尊重，而不是持满人身份自居高位。</p>

<p>而且是皇帝亲信，是咸丰施政的一条腿，王公家族出身，但是市井经验多，政务的执行效率与主动性很强。</p>

<p>政治上，因为肃顺是满人，他骂满人无能，就跟黑人骂黑人黑鬼一样，不会被扣上一个反满反清的帽子，相当于为当时越来越大的汉人官僚集团在统治阶层最高层发声。</p>

<p>以前的汉臣就算张廷玉做到最高位，也没法跟满人一样名正言顺去表达政治观点。</p>

<p>行政上，因为肃顺负责咸丰年间许多工作，具体不细说，但雷厉风行且办事得当，能肃清吏治是很明显的，能力也被公认。</p>

<p>那这样一个人，既有王公背景姓爱新觉罗，又是满人那时绝无仅有的的行政强人，还不像鬼子六一样跟咸丰有利益矛盾冲突被顾忌，更认知到满人不行，以及汉人官僚们的优点。</p>

<p>而当时长期背景是，汉人官僚其实是在往上做大，但又缺乏一个渠道，肃顺刚好填补了这点，几乎把当时在满清内部需要解决的问题，他的个人角色都能恰到好处填充上去。</p>

<p>让咸丰安心满意，得到皇帝的全权信任，有满人身份可以在集团内部说直话实话，能意识到汉人官僚的需求并且平等的与之沟通，只讲行政身份，而不考虑满汉之分。</p>

<p>崇祯到明末也没打算彻底处理宗室尾大不掉的问题，但是肃顺当时已经考虑对满人旧制下的一些人动刀，尤其是八旗。</p>

<p>曾国藩在肃顺被杀后说慈禧是” 此冤狱也，自坏长城矣 “，这个”自“是指谁，其实不言而喻，清廷本身。</p>

<p>鬼子六属于行政改革，优化旧制度和拥抱部分新制度，做不到彻底，也不能统一当时做大的汉臣，他仍然在用部分肃顺的政策，比如汉人总督居多。</p>

<p>但就像前面说的一样，他没法凝聚汉人，他的最终目的是优化制度，而肃顺是打算淘汰满人，让汉人这个主体民族进入最高层主政，所以有这样的说法：” 其对于满员，直奴隶视之，大呼其名，恶语秽骂无所忌。一见汉吏，立即改容致敬，或称先生，或称某翁、某老爷。其索贿也亦惟满人，若汉员之一丝一粟，不敢受也。 “</p>

<p>按现在观点看，肃顺妥妥一逆向民族主义者，但就当时清朝状况，确实需要这么一个人，既有背景、身份（爱新觉罗血脉），又有能力和皇帝支持，咸丰让他当顾命大臣，相当于已经默许肃顺的改革大体方向。</p>

<p>满人集团内部后来再也没出过这样的人，光绪可能也算，但是光绪政治和行政上都很不成熟，以至于百日维新后跟慈禧关系破裂，甚至任用康有为这样的人。</p>

<p>其实清末跟改革开放历史非常像，都是保守派、改革派为主，满人旧制和毛泽东旧制度一样，很多人都知道要改，但是张不开嘴。</p>

<p>都有出来挑大梁的改革派，细节和角色可能不太一样，但是结局都是改革派被斗倒，内部派系有人继承改革派的部分良性政策做行政优化。</p>

<p>并且始终是保守派掌权，改革派背景的人可以得到任用，但始终难以完全独立自主，社会在半开半放的过程里缓慢前进，同期日本一起进行改革，但进展比清朝快很多，以至于甲午战争确立了维新成果，而清朝这个时候反应过来，却发现已经没什么可用的人手，慈禧到后来甚至打算君主立宪，也来不及了。</p>

<p>基本上杀肃顺，导致清廷内部名正言顺，能以满人法理合法融合满汉，组成新政治派系和改革的路线被彻底堵死，也因此慈禧一死，国内矛盾立刻爆发。</p>

<p>应该说，当时只有肃顺意识到了社会主体是汉人，必须废满扶汉来达到政治融合，而这个行为如果是汉人来做，清廷和满人就要永久性退出历史舞台，大概率是要打仗的。</p>

<p>但如果是满人来做，还是他这个皇室支系，顺水推舟就容易很多，起码能和平过渡。</p>

<p>郭嵩焘是肃顺的亲信近臣，他后来到英国观念大改，开始主张全面西化，这对于当时的人来说观念上可以转弯是非常难得的，也能看出来肃顺一系的官僚接受新兴事物和实事求是的程度，如果肃顺代表清廷利益，此时仍然主政的话，外访可能要更早发生，并且处理八旗后就会全面进行真正意义的洋务运动。</p>

<p>换其他人来，要么引起慈禧猜疑，要么也无法统筹汉人官僚集团，肃顺与汉人官僚们的关系密切，是鬼子六比不了的，更无法得到咸丰全力支持和信任，所以说清廷是慈禧开始把自己作没了一点没错。</p>

<p>只是不知道慈禧晚年开始跟热锅上的蚂蚁一样连君主立宪都肯时，会不会想起当年不应该杀肃顺，搞到最后都是北洋汉人和革命党汉人之间争天下，满人被彻底踢出历史舞台。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1846.4</strong> —–2022-11-25 23:26:55+08:00:</p>

<p>台湾主权问题背后我个人认为有两个原因</p>

<p>第一，纯粹从内部来看，民国哪怕丢失大陆，也是一个客观存在的政治实体，并没有断代过，从清朝灭亡到现在都持续存在，有非常明确的法统继承顺序，中共是靠内战获得胜利，但是这种方式获得的合法性，在改革开放后面临了一个议题。</p>

<p>那就是暴力是否还能作为合法性的单一来源去证明大家都支持自己，也自然构成了共和国法理被质疑的环境。</p>

<p>因为改革开放本身就是公开承认了内部那套撑不住，必须靠经济增长来保证自身合法性。</p>

<p>反过来讲，就是说当年赶跑国民党说自己有合法性的说辞用到改革开放算结束了，之后需要经济和生活水平带来合法性，而隔壁台湾已经做到完成转型。</p>

<p>也即是说，民国是不是也可以代表先进的社会生产秩序，跟中共自己宣传的一样去反过来再取代大陆呢，虽然台湾放弃反攻大陆的打算，但中共内部危机分裂后，有一个强力对比在，会让中共传统话术带来的威信变得很有限的。</p>

<p>第二，纯粹从利益角度看，无论大陆出现什么政权，都没有任何道理会放弃台湾地区主权，这是单纯的利益问题，战略、经济价值都过高，新政权可能会接受台湾的事实独立以及反对武统并且友善化，但一个执政集团，是不可能放弃这种关乎国家社会利益的东西。</p>

<p>而对中共来说，就更不可能了，当然这层因素是相对次要的，因为他们反正也控制不了，更没能力通过民主化和平统一组建联邦，因此第一点是更主要的原因（而起码如果有新政权愿意亲台，改变双方看法后和平统一是至少有可能的）</p>

<p>台湾的存在是对中共一切政策与合法性的一面镜子，当初你说自己是先进，现在人家先进了，也是为什么国内舆论对台湾开火仅次于美国的一个主要原因。</p>]]></content><author><name>Spinkcat</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-11-07~2022-11-13的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-10/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-11-07~2022-11-13的言论" /><published>2022-11-10T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-11-10T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-10/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-10/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>317.1</strong> —–2022-11-08 01:16:16+08:00:</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Arunabha Ghosh, Artur Runge-Metzger, David G. Victor, and Ji Zou]</p>

<p>To be sure, there is still a role for global diplomacy in the fight against climate change, particularly when it comes to issues that smaller groups simply cannot address—such as setting overall expectations for financial and technical assistance to poorer nations and agreeing on broad global emissions goals. On these subjects, governments will have conflicts and a global consensus will be hard to achieve. But the process is unavoidable and worth the effort.<br />
On many topics that have dominated global climate diplomacy, however, the endless wrangling has not generated much benefit. The world should not have spent seven years debating reporting rules, and it should not now have a lengthy debate over the definition of “climate finance.” In fact, the last two decades of global negotiations have made it clear that trying to fight climate change through sweeping global agreements that cover every sector and country is more likely to produce acrimony and gridlock than anything else. In Egypt, then, it is important not to be demoralized by inevitable diplomatic fissures on top-line negotiations, such as on how to compensate countries for the damage of climate change—important as such negotiations (and issues) may be. Activists must put a newfound emphasis on what’s been on the sidelines, where governments and companies will be making decisions that can also reshape the planet.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Spinkcat在2022-10-31~2022-11-06的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-06/Spinkcat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spinkcat在2022-10-31~2022-11-06的言论" /><published>2022-11-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-06/Spinkcat</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-11-06/Spinkcat/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>—– <strong>1833.1</strong> —–2022-11-01 16:01:44+08:00:</p>

<p>自由化与工业化程度发达的现代社会，以及反自由化与农业化习性残留的威权社会。</p>

<p>这样划分言简意赅。</p>

<p>中国就是这道坎，迈过去了，人类社会的总体倾向都会开始走向前者，迈不过去就是三战。</p>

<p>自由化是一种释放工业化社会下，对应生产力的社会氛围，可以把民主制度形成的成熟社会秩序，理解为是其运行规则的体现。</p>

<p>威权化社会更喜欢服从命令，因为产业单一，服从命令的个体和群体，更容易协调生产，减少资源竞争。</p>

<p>工业化需求复杂多变时，就有迫切必要释放人的自主性，这个过程里就产生了自由化。</p>

<p>这是一种先验的，不可逆的发展趋势，因此威权社会对自由化社会而言，是”你们终将成为我们“。</p>

<p>威权社会体现的更多是操作社会上易于控制和易于服从的个体，由少数人代表政权，因为有威权趋同性，因此天然靠拢。</p>

<p>威权政权对如何解释自身存在合理性上，也是一直在演化的。</p>

<p>早期大体理解为，基于民族主义的”帝国主义亡我之心不死“，纳粹在阐述这类观点上时，没有经过太多包装，是纯粹社达。</p>

<p>苏联时期则是意识形态之争，提出一个道路，指出该道路有先进性，然后被证实破产（但是证实也要很多年，所以会告诉你是初级阶段来搪塞）</p>

<p>再到后来就是意识形态破产，中国、印度、俄罗斯都逐渐转投市场经济，放弃所谓的先进性。</p>

<p>然后就出现了更民族主义叙事的”区别论“，也即国家是有区别的，他们的社会制度，不代表我们也会发展出来。</p>

<p>试图否定自由化社会这种天然现象，是具备先验普世性的，来维护自身政权在理论上存在的合理性。</p>

<p>典型的就是资本论，财团控制政府，或者西方国家打压你，不让你发展起来，还有更有幽默感的说资源不够用，所以不会让你发展起来。</p>

<p>实际上这就是回归到纳粹早期的那套农业社会所产生的竞争观念上。</p>

<p>自由化是一种生产力的体现，只要社会经济越发达，工业越繁荣，需要更严谨的法律以及执行细节，就会对社会所运作的”软件“有硬性刚需。</p>

<p>就跟农业过渡工业社会早期，生产力发达，帝制和贵族社会逐渐被淘汰，从帝制到威权再到传统民主社会，可以看得出，权力是在逐渐分散的。</p>

<p>因为生产需要的权力涉及社会的每个环节，包括消费也是，没有生产，无法消费。没消费，也无法产生进一步生产更好产品的资金累积。</p>

<p>所以越发达的生产，才越需要权力分散的社会体系，就是所谓的自由化。</p>

<p>对威权社会的群体来讲，或者说对出厂预设是威权主义的个体而言，你给他什么，他就接受什么，无论他是否反对你，因为他需要的是一个能安排他一切生产行为的集体对象。</p>

<p>好比说中国今天要改革了，那些之前反对自由化的保守威权主义者，没有几个会跳出来坚持维护。因为威权主义，只是一种服从状态，这种生产秩序无法对接到更发达的生产环境里。</p>

<p>而因为更发达的生产体系，需要放权，导致威权社会，尤其是威权政权的执政者们，在利用不受控的权力获取一切好处时，对可能破坏自己控制的生产秩序会产生抵触和反对。</p>

<p>很多社会其实都曾经碰到过转型的临界点，也即有某种资源，矿产、石油、劳动力等基础资源，快速发展庞大的消费和生产市场，累积经验与技术，逐渐转型近发达时，累积的财富和体系却突然因为威权政府介入而崩溃。</p>

<p>阿根廷、叙利亚、利比亚都曾经有过大量资源，中国实际在十九世纪与日本是同步改革，但是放权慢了，导致后来近一个世纪都处于被动状态。</p>

<p>这种现象层出不穷，根本原因在于偏农业化的社会，是以权力作为社会媒介。</p>

<p>任何分散减少权力的改革都有可能触及当权者的生存根本，而一个更发达的社会是不可能不通过分权形式达成的。</p>

<p>国家之间必然存在竞争，但竞争的核心逻辑，在于政权为何而执政。</p>

<p>对威权国家来讲，无论一开始是什么原因，当威权客观存在后，形成既得利益集团，那么就必然退化或”进化“成为了控制社会，就跟打天下坐天下一样。</p>

<p>然后一切政治理念和政策，都会为控制政权延续而服务，这就造成了一系列的荒谬。</p>

<p>当落后的威权政府耗尽大部分他们没能力发展和生产的工业社会资源，就会开始出现崩溃问题。</p>

<p>实际人类社会现在应该按照生产秩序和对应收入划分：</p>

<p>已发达国家，生产100%的需求。（欧美日韩之类）</p>

<p>近发达国家，承担80-100%的需求。（中国）</p>

<p>待发达国家，承担剩余20%的需求。（印度、东南亚、俄罗斯、东欧）</p>

<p>也就是说，在庞大人口体量前，中国已经吃下大部分市场。</p>

<p>如果中国继续发展转型成已发达国家，生产需求会扩增到200%，哪怕无法做到全部地区发达化，也能扩张几个亿人口的消费市场，制造外部需求，从而带动俄罗斯等威权社会的变革，这也是中国变化的开始。</p>

<p>现在是大部分国家，根本不会受到生产红利带来的社会进化影响，因为发达国家的市场只够中国的人口快速发展而已，一旦中国也转型，也会加速其他国家跟着一起转型。</p>

<p>尤其是对体量小的国家，同时还可以养活体量更大的国家。因为中国发达化后，传统发达市场不会消失，只会从12亿人变成26亿人，甚至是30亿。</p>

<p>30亿意味着需要一个至少30亿的承担角色。世界上没有人口这么多的国家，两个印度都不够。</p>

<p>因此可以想象，中国这道坎过去后，能提供给全球多大的政治生态冲击。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1833.2</strong> —–2022-11-06 01:40:43+08:00:</p>

<p>现在人类使用的绝大部分资源，都是加工产品，而基础资源是够用的，因为每次技术进步，都会扩大探测、生产效率，最典型的就是石油，从石油危机到现在，结果越挖越多，还需要油组内部减产刹车来控制价格避免暴跌。</p>

<p>实际上决定这些资源生产的技术，早就足够市场盈余，真正缺乏的是如何用合理的人力和生产成本去制造后再投入到市场赚钱，这也是为什么油组明明能把石油价格压低，但是必须考虑到每桶生产的人力成本和收益。</p>

<p>所以大部分产品，只要涉及技术增值，核心问题都来自于人力的附加产值增减。</p>

<p>在这个过程里发达国家有技术优势，内部消费优势，才能从市场贸易链里获取一个优势地位，并且在发展过程里，累积大量资源，刚好在二三十年间的某个新兴产业里跟先发国家同时起跑，这样能错开赛道，在部分领域后发而先至。</p>

<p>这样时候后发达国家在新赛道里的投资，不但能加强新兴产业的发展速度，本身也是有利于这些国家的，同时还能最大程度减少新旧国家的市场矛盾。</p>

<p>这世界上并不是固定五十种产业，发达国家就站在这五十个产业里不让其他人进来，而是不断有新兴产业出现。</p>

<p>资源不够用是很敷衍的结论，如果中国十几亿人都能有发达国家的消费能力和需求，只会让其余二三十亿人为了赚这笔钱加大力度生产。</p>

<p>现代社会最大问题跟不是资源，而是消费不足，创造需求的速度满，发达国家人口少。</p>

<p>现在发达消费人口占全球不到六分之一，大概12-14亿人左右，假设能创造一倍的市场，最多也就供养24-28亿的人口快速发展，核心最多供养12-15亿发展中社会。</p>

<p>还有其余几十亿人，没法搭上快速发展的车。</p>

<p>所以很多时候是说不让发展起来就纯是荒谬之谈。</p>

<p>因为发达市场内部也是互相获取市场价值，跨国贸易是非常普遍的事，假设美国一个工人3000刀月薪，创造的价值是大于3000刀，企业才能活下来，并且承担工人福利开销，以及有盈余去抵御风险，还有最后的进行扩张，雇佣更多工人。</p>

<p>那销售利润从哪来？假设你一个罐头8美刀，卖给发展中国家，一个月他们才赚500美刀，那根部不可能买得起罐头，也就是说你这个发达市场的企业，在这种消费水平低，没发展起来的市场，根本没多少油水可捞。</p>

<p>哪怕你转移生产线，降低成本刀5美刀一罐头，市场对象也不是当地人（可以换成苹果手机），而是降低成本后用于在发达市场内部跟同行竞争。</p>

<p>也就是说，12亿总人口的发达市场，让你的产品定位、市场劳动力价格和质量决定你的必然成本，你不可能亏本卖到发展中地区，12亿的发达市场就是你的主要销售额来源。</p>

<p>只有当发达市场不断扩大，比如说中国有一半人口进入发达水平了，变成19亿的全球发达市场，作为企业的销售上限才能提高。</p>

<p>一些食物可能因为地区影响，每个地区销售都是有极限的，再多了人口变化不大，当地人口味影响也不会买，那只有出新产品，或者拓展新市场才能进一步让企业在通胀当中，有更多盈利。</p>

<p>更多盈利意味着更多就业，更多就业意味着更多消费，一系列综合下来就是社会的经济活动以及内需消费的成长，形成经济稳健的基础。</p>

<p>经济价值的传递，就是通过贸易将不同形式的人力服务进行转导，然后通过分工与自身所持有的特长交换劳动价值，所以很多人说发达国家对发展中国家剥削就很扯淡，发展中国家要技术没技术，要人力大部分还没人力，大部分都是从合资开始。</p>

<p>国内第一条电视生产线都是通过跟日立合资来的，然后学技术学经验，还能给工人超出本国原来环境的劳动待遇与收入。</p>

<p>主要划分其实就两点，改革、保守与否。</p>

<p>中共实际没有什么右派不右派的了，起码改革开放后，内部就不怎么用这种粗暴划分，只用左右派来区分就很容易进入误区。</p>

<p>党内从六四后，主张的是邓坚持的市场化改革，政治上则是维持四个基本原则，让陈云和李先念、王震这面的路线占了上风，并且取得最终胜利。</p>

<p>陈云什么路线，就是红色江山红色子弟，六四后他们就长期掌握人事权，第三梯队时一大批干部子弟都被选入培育当储备，如果没有后来政治风波，他们可能不一定有今天的位置。</p>

<p>但是只要按照这条铺好的路继续走，太子党接班就只是时间问题，且是六四前后几年就确定的，到后面愈发明确。</p>

<p>江泽民等人，是技术性官僚还政太子党的过渡而已，团派也不过是改开余孽，邓小平留给身后仅存的政治力量而已，邓小平六四后立刻死了没南巡，江泽民跟陈云、李先念这群人早就停止改革开放了，也亏他活到九七年，把人手安排好才死。</p>

<p>实际情况就该反过来理解”让这群技术性官僚干几年就滚蛋。“，现在看实际就是印证了过去就有的观点，太子党会上台全面接班继承陈云路线。</p>

<p>很多事未必会公开，他们不想让社会太早感知到这种风雨欲来的感觉，所以挂名是可能的，让这些机构进行配额销售，某些已经在做了。</p>

<p>政治内核为传统打江山坐江山的王朝思维</p>

<p>执行上由太子党、贵族与技术官僚执政，以太子党为核心，贵族与寡头为主体，技术官僚负责执行无权参与决策。（二十大后敲定）</p>

<p>经济上走国家资本主义，部分由国有控制经济，较多数由政府扶持或控制的白手套企业垄断资源，两者之间可以随时按需调换。用以获取最大经济和资源利益、控制权，同时规避企业的风险。</p>

<p>社会上实行人口与土地管控，通过户籍圈禁人口流动控制劳动力价格，用以为土地财政供给地方政府运作，制造人为的土地稀缺性，抬高价格，逼迫民众高价购入不稀缺的资源，以及让被户籍限制的入城务工群体，被迫以廉价价格出售劳动力。</p>

<p>意识形态上从社会主义迅速褪色，会用社会主义偏左的口号，以及民族主义的旗帜，掩盖贵族门阀化的政权结构，严重缺乏有效理论工具证明自身能代表先进生产力。</p>

<p>阶级上分为四类，以贵族、门阀为首的贵族阶级，以技术官僚、商人、产业头部为主的群体的专业阶级，以白领、知识分子、部分中产为主的城市阶级，以农民、乡镇居民、各地流动人口为主的农村阶级。</p>

<p>由农村阶级提供廉价劳动力，作为驱动经济与服务的原材料基础，去供养城市阶级，从而产生更高质量税收给中央，以及利用不动产执行土地财政，对农村阶级和城市阶级进行二次剥削。</p>

<p>再通过专业阶级负责带领城市阶级与农村阶级，组织和进行生产，或者替负责决策的贵族阶级执行政策。</p>

<p>他们一直都很有危机感，尤其是零八年经济冲击后，习近平上台表露出来了。六四后则是敲定了长期危机感的大背景，但江胡时期发展很好，淡化掉，然后红二代有主人公意识，危机感比传统技术官僚更浓，抓的也更紧。</p>

<p>两个问题一起谈，也是相关的。</p>

<p>GDP增长考核仍然存在，但是省份挤水分后的权重下降了，此时维稳和疫情考核就列入其中，权重大幅度上升。</p>

<p>谈不上激励机制，如果说以前还可能有的话，现在就是惩罚机制，比如说曾经你GDP稳定增长多少年，算你一个功劳，现在达不到一定比例，就要把你拉入黑名单，变成KPI，而不是给奖励让人去有积极性做。</p>

<p>两者过去也存在，但是比重不同，现在比重颠倒了。</p>

<p>所以对地方中小企来说，反而是最折腾的，这个也是很容易产生误解的地方，中小企是最容易受这种政治政策影响的存在，地方不会说不为了一个月绩效不去干烂中小企。</p>

<p>有的地方政府负责团队可能比较明白经济上的重要性，会留手照顾，大部分还是该怎么往死整就怎么做。</p>

<p>中小企这几年已经叫苦连天，隔三岔五就找李克强抱怨，可以看国务院开会，中小企业多少次是李克强亲自领导会议的，按情况其实已经属于跨级。</p>

<p>国务院有人重视也是没有用的，因为地方党委大于政府，人事权在习近平手里，国务院和地方有明白人也没用，包括习派内的明白人也一样，只能减缓不能解决，体制问题一个人处理不了，更别提转向。</p>

<p>当然，收拾中小企更多是一种利维坦实现目的时波及到的结果，其实只需要政府给大企业和白手套企业优惠政策， 中小企照常，这些企业就会慢慢被挤兑死。</p>

<p>因为行政能力是有极限的，如果大部分精力都用于执行政治任务或扶持特定企业，就不可能再有充足资源思考中小企，尤其是中国是个行政政策主导经济的国家。</p>

<p>他们处理中小企的态度不会是说你威胁到我了，而是“我要用你当血包，请你死一死。”</p>

<p>中国土地一直不缺，问题在于畸形政策，政府需要土地收入保证财政安全，有财政安全才能拱卫政权安全。</p>

<p>所以一直靠行政手段，控制出地比例，然后逼人口聚集。</p>

<p>全球发达地区人口聚集密集，土地不足是一种自然现象，比如香港属实是没地，人口密集度和土地不成正比，过于离谱了才有奇葩现象。</p>

<p>但哪怕到东京这样的最大都市圈，一户建也是非常流行的，这样才是符合中国发展的实际情况。</p>

<p>也即是说，珠三角、长三角、北京，他们的土地面积不但够外来务工人员居住，还够本地一户建。</p>

<p>举个例子，整个东京大都市圈13557平方公里，珠三角是55368平方公里。</p>

<p>东京人口四千多万，算4100万吧。珠三角人口7800万。</p>

<p>东京大都市圈人口密度3024人，珠三角人口密度1408人。</p>

<p>东京面积 2194平方公里，人口约1400万人，深圳面积1997平方公里，人口1260万人。</p>

<p>字面上看好像深圳没什么问题 ，但反过来考虑两点，东京本身已经是房价很高了，并且核心地区出现常见的过于拥挤问题。</p>

<p>第二就是深圳实际人口是包括流动人口，实际是至少2200万以上，而日本没有那么大的人口流动状况。</p>

<p>但日本是东京本身而言，附近的交通和基建非常发达，有大量建设很好的卫星城市可以分担人口居住和就业压力。</p>

<p>深圳到目前为止，直辖的部分行政区都没发展起来，盐田龙岗什么尿性自己心里懂。</p>

<p>而房价却直追日本，性价比远不如，日本一户建往往是连地一起卖，如果自建或想要，不但可以有车库，还能有小花园和地下室。</p>

<p>这是三井不动产我随手挑在目黑区的一套房子，一千多万日元，现汇率折算人民币大概563万元。</p>

<p>建筑内面积108平方米，土地面积111平方米。按室内面积一平米5.27万元，土地面积算是5.07万元。</p>

<p>距离皇居7.5公里，明治神宫5公里，什么概念呢？相当于三环5公里到天安门，四环8公里到天安门。</p>

<p>你搁现代中国能在四环内混一个一百多平米属于自己的地皮，永久产权，还有一套双层独立别墅，要地暖有地暖，要对讲机有对讲机，步行15分钟以内有三个火车站三条线，要商店有商店，要公园有公园，要诊所有诊所，从小学到中学一应俱全，你敢想吗？</p>

<p>软硬装修都给你弄好了，还水平非常不错，这些都算到销售价里，就算你加中介抽成和政府税，最后成交价涨到600万也好，也比国内现在划算不要太多，尤其是考虑到日本基础建设。（600万元平均下来房子和土地本身价格也才5.8万和5.4万元）</p>

<p>深圳你看下价格就知道：</p>

<p><a href="https://fangjia.fang.com/sz/">https://fangjia.fang.com/sz/</a></p>

<p>点进去就能看到单价5.7万起步，6万还不止，而且没有永久产权，高层住宅也没日本那么好的产权保护，家家户户房型基本一样，而且现在越来越多针对的是超大面积，或者整体价格三四百万起步不封顶那种。</p>

<p>普通人几千收入，夫妻加在一起可能都不到一万，哪怕都翻倍，一个月两万收入，还贷多少，不确定性多大，买你大爷？</p>

<p>最后绝杀，公摊。</p>

<p>想让自己一辈子，自己儿女一辈子，都被这种畸形的社会制度绑架吗？</p>

<p>没人想。</p>

<p>—– <strong>908.1</strong> —–2022-11-02 05:57:08+08:00:</p>

<p>So I feel compelled to begin this answer by stating that almost all the premises of the question are wrong. Do not, however, feel discouraged: these are errors that are <em>extremely</em> common, especially in relation to this particular question, and carry some assumptions worth unpacking.</p>

<p>Were the Manchus assimilated into the Han? No, and especially not under the Qing. Manchus as an ethnic group remained separate – often in literal, geographical terms – down to the end of the Qing, thanks to the Banner system. By virtue of being part of the Banners, Manchus were entitled to housing in set-aside Banner quarters, as well as government stipends (not particularly huge ones, but enough to live on) as part of a broader organisation of imperial functionaries. Despite all the erosion of differences, Manchus continued to consider themselves both ethnically and culturally distinct from their Han neighbours, and vice versa: rhetoric of ethnic enmity would flare up dramatically throughout the latter third of Qing rule, from the Zhenjiang martial law crisis in 1841, to the Taiping War and Yunnanese revolt of the 1850s-70s, to the growth of radical politics in the run-up to the 1898 reforms and the 1911 Revolution. I go into more detail <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wzt8kn/antimanchu_racism_played_a_central_part_in_many/im53pia/">here</a>, but in brief, anti-Manchuism was an <em>incredibly</em> widespread phenomenon, and one that would have made no sense whatever if Manchus had somehow ceased to be considered as different.</p>

<p>Did they never face widespread persecution? The answer would be no. Both the Taiping and the Yunnanese had strong anti-Manchu agendas, and the radicals of the 1890s-1910s similarly subscribed to such beliefs. Social Darwinist approaches like Liang Qichao argued that Manchus had to be forced to miscegenate with Han so that their bloodlines would survive a presumed race war between white Europeans and East Asians. 30,000 Manchus, mostly civilians, were massacred in Nanjing by the Taiping in 1853; 20,000 were slaughtered in Xi’an by the revolutionaries in 1911. Mass killing never took place on a national scale, but there were extraordinary acts of anti-Manchu violence in more local contexts where sufficiently hate-fuelled Han had sufficient means to do so. Again, see the linked answer above. But while overt, mass violence was rare, quieter, simmering hatred and discrimination were not. Self-identification as Manchu was extremely rare between 1912 and the 1980s, but not because of assimilation – rather, it was because of <em>fear</em>. Fear of reprisals, fear of stigma, fear of hatred. The post-1980 resurgence in Manchu identification is a clear sign of how Manchu identity had to persist underground, but persisted regardless.</p>

<p>Does it matter that few speak Manchu natively, or that few uniquely Manchu practices survive? Not really. The possession of an identity does not rely on the existence of unique cultural practices, nor is it up to people exogenous to a group to determine what the ideal package of behaviours is that certifies someone as authentically part of that group. Scots are still Scots even if fewer than 100,000 people speak Scots Gaelic; Austrians are not Germans even if they all speak German. It is true that Manchu language use declined precipitously. It is not self-evident that identifying as Manchu and forming a community of fellow self-identifying Manchus is predicated on speaking Manchu, or performing particular practices. All that needs to happen is that identification, and that community-building. Granted, identities need some kind of element to make them meaningful: they must, to borrow some terminology from Mark Elliott, ‘cohere’ around something. But by the later stages of Qing rule the source of this coherence was the Banner system, the privileges and obligations it entailed, and the communities that formed in the Banner quarters, and not some idealised ‘Manchu Way’ promulgated in the 1750s. Modern Manchu identity may not be predicated on cultural practices, but it doesn’t have to be as long as there is <em>something</em> that makes identification as Manchu a meaningful statement.</p>

<p>Which is why the Manchus <em>have</em> remained as a distinct minority. Manchus are the fourth-largest of the 56 recognised ethnic groups in China, sitting between the Hui and the Uyghurs with around 10.5 million members and making up 0.78% of the population. They are relatively geographically scattered compared to some other minorities, but no more so than the Hui, whose coherence as an ethnic group is basically never questioned the way the Manchus’ is. What I hope I have managed to demonstrate is that Manchu identity has continued to exist, and that it is not particularly unique in context for doing so, even if perhaps the level of apparent acculturation is more extreme than many comparable examples.</p>

<p>—– <strong>908.2</strong> —–2022-11-02 08:50:08+08:00:</p>

<p>So again, the issue here is that you’re taking an approach to Manchu identity that is rooted solely in the notion that it revolves around some kind of inherited cultural practice. The reality is it doesn’t, because if it did, Manchus wouldn’t keep calling themselves Manchus. The act of identification, in and of itself, is what creates an identity that is distinct. Manchus may be indistinguishable from Han in terms of appearance or day-to-day behaviour, but the difference in identification is fundamentally all that needs to exist for an identity to do so as well. I can’t say I know with any certainty what it is that has led many to take up the Manchu label again after decades of both hard and soft persecution. But clearly there is some motivation behind doing so.</p>

<p>And it is important to note that an <em>ethnic</em> identity is not a <em>cultural</em> one: an ethnic identity is one that is, by definition, defined by descent. Such descent can be real or invented, or somewhere in between, but that’s the key thing here. The existence of an ethnic identity is not predicated on the existence of a cultural distinction from other neighbouring groups, even if that is often what happens in practice: ‘usually’ and ‘must’ are distinct categories. We can say that Manchus are, by and large, ‘acculturated’, that is to say that their cultural practices have almost entirely aligned with the majority Han. But they are not ‘assimilated’, in that they do not consider themselves a subset of Han.</p>

<p>I hope that’s helped explain where our difference in approach and interpretation lies: I’m talking in purely ethnic terms, because I am more or less only concerned with ethnic identity here.</p>

<p>—– <strong>908.3</strong> —–2022-11-03 17:13:08+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s a considerable oversimplification at best. ‘Hui’ is a complex catch-all that mostly encompasses Sinophone Muslims, but from a wide variety of genealogical backgrounds, including historic Han converts and the descendants of Turkic migrants. The concept of a ‘Hui’ identity emerged out of the notion that they were <em>essentially</em> different from the Han, whatever their background, and that this underlying difference was then performed and reified through Islam. But to paraphrase one of my other comments in this thread, there’s a difference between ‘usually’ and ‘must’ that can be drawn here: in the 1850s for instance we see Muslim leaders in southwest China lamenting a decline in religious sentiment, but their wording implies that those who effectively dropped out of the <em>ummah</em> would still be ethnic Hui.</p>

<p>A really interesting answer that admittedly left me with a question or two, namely around the influence of anarchism. How far was anarchism understood as a political philosophy before large-scale exposure to Marxism? Was it comprehended much more coherently, or was it still only really known about in relatively vague terms, just less vague? And if anarchism was the key early influence on Mao and his cadre, to what extent should we see Maoism within the context of the history of anarchism as opposed to – or in conjunction with – that of Marxism? To suggest a provocative extreme, was Maoism just anarchism with a Marxist coat of paint?</p>

<p>I have more or less planned out a wargame scenario that I may run as a participation game early next year, based on the 1864 Shimonoseki Expedition. I’ll be using Daniel Mersey’s <em>The Men Who Would be Kings</em> with a couple of minor tweaks, mainly to do with movement (which I can elaborate on if anyone really wants to know).</p>

<p>The overall plan means I need to do up 60 figures for the Europeans: 24 Royal Marines, 24 British sailors, and 12 French sailors. I have most of what I need for the Japanese force, but I’ll need to do up an extra unit of 16 armoured pikemen, as well as a few extra unarmoured swordsmen. The big thing is that I’ll need a battery of coastal artillery, so it’s a question of budget+table space in terms of where on the scale of 3 to 5 guns I do, especially as I’ll also need to do some terrain-building for a breastwork to actually mount the guns behind.</p>

<p>Similarly, early career history and history-adjacent academics have relied on Twitter for networking for a long time, and it’s also been a space that has allowed a reasonable amount of public history work to be done on an open platform. There just isn’t really an alternative to that at this stage. Mastodon is being floated as an option, but the relative insularity of communities could be an issue and essentially create a network of historians with little public visibility.</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Andrea Kendall-Taylor, Senior Fellow and Director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security; and Michael Kofman, Research Program Director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses.]</p>

<p>Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv in September underscored the magnitude of Putin’s error. As Russian forces grew exhausted, losing momentum on the battlefield, Ukraine seized the initiative, dealing the Russian military a decisive blow. Ukraine’s battlefield successes revealed the extent of the rot in Putin’s army—the sagging morale, the declining manpower, the deteriorating quality of the troops. Instead of giving up, however, Putin responded to these problems by ordering a partial military mobilization, introducing tougher punishments for soldiers who desert or surrender, and moving forward with the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Putin reacted to Russia’s falling fortunes in Ukraine just as he did to its shrinking role on the world stage: dealt a losing hand, he doubled down on his risky bet. To Putin’s evident surprise, the war in Ukraine has accelerated long-standing trends pushing his country toward decline. Europe is moving to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, diminishing both the country’s leverage over the continent and the government revenues that depend heavily on energy exports. Unprecedented international sanctions and export controls are limiting Russia’s access to capital and technology, which will cause Moscow to fall even further behind in innovation. A year ago, we argued in these pages that reports of Russia’s decline were overstated and that Russia was poised to remain a persistent power—a country facing structural challenges but maintaining the intent and capabilities to threaten the United States and its allies. Putin’s disastrous invasion underscored the dangers of dismissing the threat from Russia, but it has also hastened the country’s decline. Today, Russia’s long-term outlook is decidedly dimmer.<br />
Given these factors, there will be a strong temptation to downgrade Russia as a threat. That would be a mistake, and not just because the war has yet to be won. In Ukraine and elsewhere, the more vulnerable Moscow perceives itself to be, the more it will try to offset those vulnerabilities by relying on unconventional tools—including nuclear weapons. In other words, Russian power and influence may be diminished, but that does not mean Russia will become dramatically less threatening. Instead, some aspects of the threat are likely to worsen. For the West, recognizing that reality means abandoning any near-term hopes of a chastened Russia and maintaining support for Russia’s targets. That effort should begin in Ukraine: the United States and its allies must provide sustained support to Kyiv to ensure that Russia suffers a defeat. But even if Putin loses, the problem that Russia poses will not be solved. In many ways, it will grow in intensity. So, too, should the response to it.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-10-31~2022-11-06的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-31/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-10-31~2022-11-06的言论" /><published>2022-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-31/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-31/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>对，但不是一个人，只是刚好让我想起来了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1814.4</strong> —–2022-10-24 22:56:12+08:00:</p>

<p>这个看过，栗战书的行为，可以包括在他们没有把胡锦涛当作一个有完全独立行为能力的老人这个范畴里，希望他退场，擅自主张行动干预胡。</p>

<p>因为开会几天了，文件之前之后内部肯定有通过气，现场也是几个小时，如果是现场文件有问题，怕胡看到发飙，那一开始就不用他出席就行。如果胡发飙是个很大的问题，无论事前还是事后，也只能骗住一时，习还是避不开胡在场外的质问。</p>

<p>其实这几个人行为重点就是，胡的个人意志不能主导自己行动了，这是毋庸置疑的，出发点是什么就需要从几个主要观点里逆推结果。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1814.5</strong> —–2022-10-25 01:42:52+08:00:</p>

<p>这个话题其实深入假设脑补一个方向去推测的话也可以说挺有意思的。</p>

<p>我现在对胡的糊涂理解是精神头不足，注意力很难集中，反应比正常人慢很多，想事跟不上情况，但不是意识不清醒的那种连自己是谁都完全不知道。</p>

<p>可以脑补小剧场，推演理论上存在的一种可能（也不是说绝对，我不反对说政治斗争的观点，团派已经被边缘化挨整，当事人也无法证实了），胡的情况在过去内部会议出席过好几次，习这群人都习惯了，对胡就是：“胡老你身体不行别强撑着了，到休息室再看文件吧。”（栗战书先看到后主动拿了文件），习开始关注：“下去吧，身体要紧。那个谁，安排下，送胡老下去。”</p>

<p>胡锦涛给的反应就是：”干啥？别碰，我不下去，我还能坐的住。“（习可能也是习惯，有点不耐烦了。胡拿他文件立刻摁住，意思是这不是你的，别闹。）</p>

<p>警卫就劝：”您现在要是坐着出意外，这么多媒体还看着呢，对党和您都不好。“（给胡锦涛指了指拍摄的摄像头和媒体记者）</p>

<p>然后习就不怎么参与劝说，一直到胡被扶起来带走，栗战书中途想帮忙，被王沪宁提醒影响可能不好（之前栗战书可能还在轻拍胡锦涛的背部或准备扶他起来）</p>

<p>胡犹豫想了一会，也就不坚持了，但可能是作为一个成年人有独立自主观念，想拿回文件，而周边几个人没把他当有独立自主成年人（第三方角度说好听是替老人安排一切，胡锦涛主观视角就是人老了容易被拿捏）</p>

<p>临走时还想跟习讲话，但习其实有点不耐烦，点头是连续点了好几下，大概意思就是“行行行，没问题。”，具体吩咐什么就不清楚了。</p>

<p>然后拍李克强肩膀，李克强点头而不是一直看着，说明其实之前都有交代过一些事，习近平和李克强的反应都是答应把事办好才点头，（胡被扶起来前，习近平一度转身想扶胡锦涛起来，胡起来后两个人对视一下，习近平对胡点头）</p>

<p>因为开幕式习近平扶胡锦涛坐下，胡回顾栗战书和习近平后才坐下，然后习近平和栗战书才敢坐，这个时候胡的精神是比较足的，也跟十九大开幕差不多。</p>

<p>后续再拍他，跟闭幕式的状况就衰弱很多了。</p>

<p>北戴河因为不是公开会议，实际是党内高层休假，休息时集体议事，不清楚中共会不会安排江泽民坐轮椅或者直接把床搬运过去，毕竟二十大是公开会议，党内需要脸面，江泽民要是要插呼吸机也不能让他上场，所以胡开北戴河会议相信是没问题的，累了就直接躺在那睡觉也不怕，但二十大上肯定不行。</p>

<p>另外有说法现在已经不在北戴河开“北戴河会议”了，但党内人事决定肯定是有关键会议非公开处理，胡要是完全不接受习的安排，直接不出席其实就可以了，开幕式上作为现任党魁，习扶胡坐下才坐也说明情况。</p>

<p>胡走路不能大迈步和快速移动，警卫往上用力捞他是怕往前倾摔桌子上，很典型的帕金森情况，带走时速度很快，当初刚传出消息那段时间我还特地去找了一些资料看看是否符合。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1815.1</strong> —–2022-10-25 07:12:33+08:00:</p>

<p>1.原话应该是：中国人民实在好,饿死人（也）不想起来造反。</p>

<p>出自高华《大灾荒与四清运动的起源》，高华引用自《共和国经济风云中的陈云》，（北京：中央文献出版社，1996）224页。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>2.党内斗争不要开杀戒，否则后代不好见面。</p>

<p>《陈云年谱》下卷，中央文献出版社2000年版，第381页。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>3.无固定出处，但确有其事，只不过原始内容从哪里开始变体的不确定。</p>

<p>可能来自于：孔丹等人是我们自己的子弟，是我们将来可靠的接班人，他们不应当是清查对象。 宋永毅《文革”造反派真相》序</p>

<p>但实际上这个应该是一个老话，李南央说过60岁以上的很多人应该听过陈云的这句话，她说是因为王洪文说”二十年后见“，但实际传应该是十年后，这里估计有误传，但可以确定当时有。</p>

<p>主要针对的是文革时期造反派夺权的问题，六四后也有。</p>

<p>有一个直接证实的就是李锐，他被采访口述原话是：”陈云是这个理念，邓力群、胡乔木也都是这个理念。陈云认为，还是自己的子弟接班可靠嘛。“</p>

<p>另外高新采访李锐时，李锐也确认过陈云的确说过。胡绩伟还通过女儿跟陈云女儿交往一事反应陈云家特殊化，李锐也补刀了，大体可以理解为陈云权贵化其实当时就有体现，干部子弟特殊化，陈云其实也不怎么避讳。</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>4.有个权威人士对此竟然说：“在国民党统治时期，制定了一个新闻法，我们共产党人仔细研究它的字句，抓它的辫子，钻它的空子。现在我们当权，我们还是不要新闻法好，免得人家钻我们的空子。没有法，我们主动，想怎样控制就怎样控制。”（胡绩伟：《胡绩伟自述》第四卷）</p>

<p>钟沛璋 广东政协刊物《同舟共进》2003年2月号 也引用过。</p>

<p>钟沛璋是前中宣部新闻局局长，胡绩伟是前人民日报社长</p>

<p>不是，我没这个水平，老一辈做党史研究的比我强多了，我也只是涉猎一部分。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1815.3</strong> —–2022-10-26 02:37:15+08:00:</p>

<p>第一点其实不复杂，多思考，多反推，自己在脑内分裂出来一个辩论对象，站在对立面去合理按逻辑挑刺。</p>

<p>然后自己再从这些可能的问题里去找合理证据。</p>

<p>这是逻辑的左右脚，如果一直“单脚蹦”，肯定走不远，不过这也设计自己的知识面，不知道的当然没法去说（行事逻辑上的可能不需要）</p>

<p>丰富知识库和信息量很重要。</p>

<p>第二点其实是是失去方向的结果，我也会开几十个标签页，经常看一个人，然后感兴趣，注意力转移到其他人或事件身上，有一次看南京大屠杀历史，最后跳了几十次，跑到拿破仑时代战术上，跟一开始要找的南辕北辙。</p>

<p>但我想这根本的原因，是对信息、知识和有趣事情的好奇在驱使，所以出现这样的情况本身不必苦恼。</p>

<p>重点是要找到解决方法。</p>

<p>我回答一些问题时，也不是完全懂，但我会因为好奇，觉得有表达观点，然后去学习，在这个过程里我不断学习，知道自己要表达的大体框架是什么，或者我了解的领域，但有人问我，我需要丰富自己，就会更多去了解。</p>

<p>这个时候你就知道自己想描述的大体内容，那么你记得的资料，也不需要具体到哪个哪个数字，但是你最好记住这件事，然后标签收藏，否则哪怕大学教授也根本不可能记住那么多史料，党史学者你问个问题，现场也不一定就能回答出来。</p>

<p>这也是写文章和互联网互动的好处，因为有篇幅限制，方向更具体，所以更容易在构思内容时，知道自己要找什么答案。</p>

<p>而你每开一个标签页，目的是为了丰富你想表达内容的一部分，可能90%的内容都没有用，你不一定需要记得，除非你快速阅读时，发现一些很有趣的地方，刚好被你记住了。</p>

<p>要做的其实是，你知道这里有个知识点，10%是你回答某个问题时用到学习的，90%也是有趣和有价值的，但是用不到。那你就可以收藏起来。</p>

<p>完全没必要每一篇都死读到底，只需要学习其中一部分，话题会帮助你选择所需的内容。</p>

<p>哪怕没有问答，你也应该给自己划一条大概的线，知道要了解什么，这样大量信息里，某些有趣但无用的，你可以随时关闭，有关键文献资料的，则重点优先观看，当完成一次问答和自我解答后，就进步了。</p>

<p>总体上我想是回答更好，因为就像做开卷考试，只是看，有时候自己会记不得观点。（而不是细节，细节通常是写下来时要自己做好或算好，但需要一定刻到脑子里，因为你自己尽可能严谨写完后，信息就被你以某个形式记录下来，哪怕你后续忘了，只要你记得这个话题有这件事，也能随时找回。）</p>

<p>还有就是关心什么，就去了解什么，我的大部分观点都是基于改革开放历史和我喜欢感兴趣的事，这些东西自然而然会上心，完全不觉得累，相反每次做出结果都有正反馈，这样就更有动力。</p>

<p>你找到自己喜欢的话题，在话题里找准方向再推进，才能有正反馈，当你确定要做这件事时，开再多标签也别让信息扰乱你的方向，如果强迫自己做没兴趣的方向，肯定没正反馈，你做这件事本身就很容易痛苦而无法推进。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1815.4</strong> —–2022-10-29 04:13:10+08:00:</p>

<p>历史虽然任人打扮，但除了阅读量增加可以串联判断外。</p>

<p>还可以看消息来源，这一点是现代比起古代近代最好的一点，互联网提供了相当多的信息源，信息源的时代背景、环境、人物，都反应出信息的价值与真实性。</p>

<p>这样对比信息就有了更多的参考意义，不需要单方面引用一个源头，才有更大的自我辩证空间。</p>

<p>第二点我对好奇心拓展，很多也是看而不学，不会特地去记住，我好奇心还是在的，所以有时间可能就随机再次阅读回原来关掉的页面，久而久之形成一个印象，但这个还是比较少的。</p>

<p>知识的原始累积要看你的目的，很难说一个事完全没目的去大量长时间的累积，就好像我，我学现代史和做收集数据，是为了科普，为以后大环境有个方向做铺垫，那我现在能意识到未来需要的，其实就在过去历史上可以找到出路，那我就很自然，完全没抗拒感。</p>

<p>当你尝试要给人去解释某些东西时，你越追求能力范围内的严谨，对你感兴趣，且用得到的信息，就会记的越清楚，再有就是别光靠个人，多用科技工具，人是不可能什么都记住的，所以目的性很重要。</p>

<p>等你一大堆目的性的功能完成后，可能回过头来发现自己能信手拈来，我说的一些观点和内容，不一定是遇到疑问时我已经会了，很多反而是促进我去学习的动力，在这个过程里进步。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1816.1</strong> —–2022-10-25 05:33:07+08:00:</p>

<p>我觉得核心争议都被忽略的问题是，如果胡锦涛因为名单本身被带走，那得搞清楚手里的名单到底有什么作用。</p>

<p>工作角度讲，会议开很久了，他在这个过程里应该已经看过名单，不可能刚好被拍摄了，才想起来去看。</p>

<p>假设名单跟实际对不上，可目前描述是中央委员已经表决结束了才允许他们进去。</p>

<p>中央委员选举人名单是21号完成的，胡锦涛有一天时间去看，并且跟团派的人通气，现场选完后，胡也看完整个流程，之前他肯定是拿着名单在看的。</p>

<p>中共内部这些名额都是提前预定好的，内选后再拿出来表决。</p>

<p>二十大提名中央委员候选人222名，当选205名，落选17名，差额率跟十七大差不多，也就是说大体按预设执行，团派吃瘪是板上钉钉子的事。胡如果发火有用，需要骗他避免某种麻烦，事前事后都避不开，那就没有必要让胡出席，</p>

<p>名单在这里起什么作用，发现很多人其实没有延伸讨论。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1816.2</strong> —–2022-10-25 08:07:18+08:00:</p>

<p>中央委员候选人跟当选人数量偏差不大，因为确认候选人表决，到选举，再到宣布当选，和富余时间处理收尾问题，每个步骤都有流程，不是直接投票。</p>

<p>如果有问题，确认候选人和选举过程里，就该发作了，要架走外媒进场前，胡锦涛应该已经离席。但是拍摄到胡锦涛离场恰巧是在全部流程确认走完，并且还在允许外媒进场后，也就是说之前表决到出结果确认的过程没问题，确认完结果后，到开放也有一定时间。</p>

<p>胡想闹别扭，官方有足够多时间处理不暴露，胡也没道理确认选举人、选举、宣布结果、空余时间四个过程里都从来没想起来看。</p>

<p>身体原因的说法我觉得有合理性的基础，是因为很多人聚焦这个名单，但忽略了整个会议持续的时间与流程，以及官方有能力确认场内无事后才放人进去，忘了名单之前有多少流程是被把控，且胡如果没问题，是有能力全程审阅的。</p>

<p>胡出现情况，是一切流程走完后，所有人就绪拍摄，也被允许拍摄后才有的，在此之前确认候选人和结果就至少有两轮机会胡肯定看过手上名单。</p>

<p>如果当时发现有问题，媒体进去时胡就不会在那个位置上了。</p>

<p>因为前面流程太多了，胡没问题很难不确认，现场听出问题，也肯定是解决后才允许媒体进入，无论胡在不在。</p>

<p>大部分人都认为收走名单，是不希望胡看到，进而判断是名单有问题，忘记前面的有好几个流程是要反复确认名单的，以及最后流程是确认完没有任何麻烦，才会放人进来。</p>

<p>即便不考虑上述流程，胡到选完，几十分钟后放人进来了才想起来看名单，台上肯定没人无法对照，栗和习、王三人哪怕什么都不做，胡也只能坐在椅子上。</p>

<p>不让胡翻的一个前提是，胡知道了，他们要承受代价，但团派明确是边缘化了，胡也肯定在此前是知道情况，不知道的话当场看完中委会选举也该清楚，没威慑力了。</p>

<p>那么当场让胡看到，和事后让胡看到，胡也没法改变什么，本质没区别。除非当场胡会跟习有大规模争吵，那取消媒体环节，或者延长选举后的空余时间来处理胡就可以了，甚至干脆不让他出席。</p>

<p>最不济不怕得罪胡，习顶多摆脸，胡在现场也只能装无事发生，没必要栗战书还去劝，引起注意，附近的人当胡不存在，胡也只能跟李克强和胡春华一个姿势，所以劝和带他离开，真的现场撕破脸了实际是多余动作。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1816.3</strong> —–2022-10-25 09:47:48+08:00:</p>

<p>那得有个假设，确定下目标是什么。</p>

<p>很多人第一反应说名单，流程想一下都知道哪里有问题，然后大部分人就停下了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1816.4</strong> —–2022-10-25 19:28:48+08:00:</p>

<p>他作为以不折腾出名的中共前党魁，怎么做才符合党的利益起码是知道的，再怎么算计去等外媒，胡就算现场质问习表现出不开心，习如果觉得担心外人视角，只需要应声然后装死就行，胡也不可能现场把桌子掀了打他耳光。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1816.5</strong> —–2022-10-25 19:44:32+08:00:</p>

<p>其实对我来说身体原因还是现场翻脸不重要，团派边缘化已经是既定事实，大家争脸红反而暴露内部问题，最不能理解的是为什么那么多人忽视党内和会议本身的既定程序。</p>

<p>反贼集体若有解释问题不能逻辑自洽的毛病，只是从观感上给答案，未来遇到各种各样问题，也很难站得住脚，经不起考验，容易被人从理论高地揪下来。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1816.6</strong> —–2022-10-25 20:04:50+08:00:</p>

<p>其实一切问题都在于，会议流程确认内容次数太多，开始太久，有疑问记者进去前肯定都发生了。</p>

<p>这一代人的确很多都是从基层干上来的，因为刚好得益于当时胡赵政府培育第三梯队，而且胡赵当时提拔人才，选用年轻人的风气盛行，给了很多其实放现在根本不可能有机会进入政府的人渠道。</p>

<p>美军只要没有第一时间参战拦截大陆海军力量获得制海权，中共就很大可能能控制附近海域，美国会不会冒全面战争风险让主力舰队进攻没法确定，一旦犹豫错过最佳时机，后续登陆战就要看台湾人自求多福。</p>

<p>冲绳基地不能指望太多，因为不能排除中共会冒风险拦截任何靠近台湾的美国军队。</p>

<p>台湾缺乏地理环境，主要补给中心、动员区域、行政核心都暴露在可登陆范围内，如果第一轮攻台没挡住，部队甚至缺乏换防空间。</p>

<p>宣战但不得出结果，围而不打是下下策，一鼓作气没拿下来才能选择这种妥协方法。因为开战拿不下来，美军就有能力反应和干预，全球范围的大规模制裁会让攻台成本收益迅速失衡。</p>

<p>而且攻台打不下来选择围困，意味着第一轮登岛的部队全灭，台湾几十万兵力，陆续登岛起码也是十万以上，十万级起跳的人员损失，王牌部队建制被消灭和后续经济封锁对社会稳定会有极大的冲击。</p>

<p>所以中共只会一鼓作气赌到底，选择武统就会梭哈，台湾海军的主要作用就是拖时间，争取拖到美国军方进行迅速反应，时间就是一切。双方都懂这个道理。</p>

<p>美方没打定主意全力介入，或者大陆影响情报讯息，台湾军队无法有效抵御，都可能造成局面倾斜。虽然打下来了台湾也会陷入长期治安和游击战就是了。</p>

<p>团派没完全掌握过人事权，六四后人事权主要在陈云支系手里，人事权巅峰也就在胡锦涛任内了。李克强这一代人事权也有，肯定也是最少的。</p>

<p>另外推测李克强在党内可能因为国务院负责一线行政工作，疫情后一些问题会被抓辫子放大攻击，没有站得住脚的功劳，内部开会说话也直不起腰。</p>

<p>汪洋同期是政协，公职已经到顶了，转任总理需要很大的能量，团派显然没运作的能力。</p>

<p>胡春华合适，但团派自身难保，都到了需要主动对中央提退休的程度，胡春华根本保不住。</p>

<p>尤其是疫情下的经济，是个巧妇难为无米之炊的问题，胡春华负责农业，尤其是脱贫。</p>

<p>实际上李克强跟习近平不和，看一下李克强特地说6亿人收入1000元，这跟习近平主张的精准脱贫是背道而驰的，当时还不能很确定这种步调不一致的情况让矛盾大到什么程度，但现在团派全灭，从“权威人士”，到地摊经济，再到后来地方行政屏蔽李克强信息，以及李对脱贫话题的发言，矛盾是很明确的。（但不要过于夸大，主要是党内工作矛盾。）</p>

<p>胡春华既要为习的政治任务进行脱贫，又作为团派有自身利益，这是很矛盾的事，这里具体怎么回事也不能立刻下结论，但李克强的数据谁给的？</p>

<p>没准这也是胡春华被彻底边缘化的一个因素，团派失势一个是习派的人全面上位，这是客观层面的。</p>

<p>在党内还是要有一定政治或工作过错，作为合理的借口，习才能在党内相对合理获得对二十大的所有人事权，可能是一次的，也可能是多次碰瓷的结果，并且除了人事权外，还能让团派自己退下来。</p>

<p>莫干山会议和农研室、体改委，这里涉及的人才，只有一部分后来进入了政府内部。</p>

<p>成为仅有的为中国发展提供动力的年轻血液，尤其是莫干山会议这样涉及面极广的，许多年轻学者本身是可以直接转入行政领域，大大加强社会政策的实用性，减少行政官僚不懂学术，学术没有行政操作不接地气又无权的现象。</p>

<p>第三梯队什么人都有，但基本到二十一大就差不多要消耗殆尽了。</p>

<p>胡赵当时典选的人才储备，大体分为两种，一类是在第三梯队里被考察的行政系统干部，另一类就是可能无法被简单概括到第三梯队里的学术型干部。</p>

<p>前者当中有不少红二三代，习近平薄熙来都是其中之一，也有不少较早进入政府的平民派。</p>

<p>而后赵紫阳空降的许多学术型干部，或者准备作为预备役，都是为了给这些行政出身的干部配对工作，这些人也多是平民出身，但涉及政府层面工作是学术、研讨、调查为主，可以称之为学术派。</p>

<p>也就是说，九十年代由胡启立、田纪云这些中生代接棒，到两千年开始让年轻干部逐渐接手。</p>

<p>到当代中国社会的官僚构成会大体分为红色子弟、平民派、学术派。可以说是能让党内保守派、行政需求、理论需求都得到满足。</p>

<p>但六四后导致的结果是，只有红色子弟和技术官僚，二十大后，董事会自己完全控制一线工作，负责这个集团运作的专业技术人员甚至都不能成一派了。</p>

<p>别说政治改革，经济改革本身都停滞，该在九十年代展开侧重社会公平性的改革，却摇身一变成为李鹏这样不懂理论胡乱操作，最后尾大不掉的经济问题，要一刀切去减负自救，把国家治理的一团糟。</p>

<p>太子党完全执政后，技术官僚和学术派别已经不可能在决策上有专业主导权，未来行政对社会的干预，只会更加任性。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1831.1</strong> —–2022-10-29 09:11:20+08:00:</p>

<p>台湾政府目前给我感觉是不太上心，对危机戒备不到位，民众的抵抗意志和游击战力度不会低，政府再废物，等多十一二年的选举习惯，几代人都是民选背景下长大，你把他们选出来政府给打掉，不可能坐视不理。</p>

<p>除此之外，台湾是个岛，大部分维持现生活水平的物资需要外部运输，这意味着一旦开战，生活水平就会大幅度下滑，假设中共登岛站稳，沦陷是时间问题了，应该会出现两个阶段。</p>

<p>第一阶段有抵抗意志的人会在城市拖延敌军主力推进，然后中共会设置安定点，大量运输物资到岛上，这些安定点物资用于吸收人口，这样坚持留在未受控范围的人，都会直接默认成敌人，降低排查成本，同时分化岛上群体。</p>

<p>台湾的城市结构打游击巷战非常蛋疼，治安战成本极高，人口密度导致大规模火力不可能有安全区域。</p>

<p>第二阶段，第一轮有抵抗意志的人被消灭后，事实上岛内还是无法解决就业和物资问题，中共能不能拿出那么多物资供应两千多万人，看看上海就知道尿性了。</p>

<p>所以日子人里，很快就会出现第二批有反抗情绪的人，因为中共基本温饱都解决不了。治安也无法维持，许多需要医疗耗材才能生存的人，基本必死，因为停电可能是攻台第一要务。</p>

<p>并且在人口聚居区域以东的位置，会是第一批抵抗人士的主要躲藏地，安定点建立后会，合理战略会是隔离出以山脉为分界的区域，海上和陆地封锁，剩下就是等这面的人资源匮乏，游击部队大概率会为生存开始劫掠然后被抓舆论话柄。</p>

<p>如果什么都指望美国一定介入和中共不敢打，不如趁早投降。假设政治环境有需要，中共唯一不敢打是原因就是财政不行，没钱用于这么庞大的开销和善后。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1831.2</strong> —–2022-10-31 20:13:44+08:00:</p>

<p>说不上心是相对大陆的积极态度，因为你说完全不上心吧，其实从20年后各方面军购还是开销都在上升，也有人意识到了问题。</p>

<p>但都达不到比较理想的阶段，就这个月二十大前，台湾国防部和国安局首脑还说没迹象中共攻台提前，或者表达不会有战争的说法，然后国安局那面的头又开始改口中共明年可能“以战逼谈”，然后国会秘书长又说没看到有迹象。</p>

<p>2023年发生的确不太可能，但也能反应出台湾内部高层对这件事看法其实不统一，</p>

<p>台湾社会和内部，有一些人的危机感提升是明确的，可是要做出转型，假设未来几年中共攻台，也就五年时间，是根本不够的。</p>

<p>台湾目前采取的是豪猪战略，但这个非对称战略的核心，都在于依赖美国会介入。他们没有做第二手预案，如果美国不介入，或者豪猪战略撑不到美国介入怎么办。</p>

<p>过去台湾军费不足，军事配套有问题，资金购买昂贵但数量不够容易被打击的军工产品，对过去台湾实际是个伪需求，因为中共当时根本没能力。</p>

<p>但随着中共发展起来，也开始有大量对台压制很强的精良军工产品后，这就不是伪需求了。</p>

<p>可同时诞生新问题，台湾为登岛后必须长期作战的需求，对数量庞大适用于非对称和长期作战的廉价军工产品需求也开始大增，按照以前的军费是肯定必须做舍取的。</p>

<p>所以台湾军费拉高，尽可能在两者之间都获得一定收益，才是最佳选择。；另外兵役改革也是举棋不定，战略储备相对好点，但也是临近二十大才表态，很多台湾方面的信息都是十月开始频繁，说明他们内部也开始有点急，可是到2022年才来，会不会比中共准备这么多年要晚。</p>

<p>政治上蔡英文实际我觉得并没处理好对大陆问题，早几年当选，他们危机意识不强，对大陆姿态太高，导致后来没有政治拉扯余地，实际上最应该做的就是阳奉阴违，而不是上来把所有政治目标全部摊牌，一方面促进大陆武统决心，另一方面岛内没有统一步调，根本没有办法在提出政治对立的同时，同步转型发展军备与战略。</p>

<p>已经落后了，本来大家同步发展，现在慢半拍你不拿出150%的努力，假设未来窗口期内真发生战争，根本达不到战略需求，因为中共不会等你发展好，他也在发展军备，时机到了就会出手。</p>

Basically, did the Qing leadership lead to a “Chinese Dark Age” as some claim?</a>, submitted on 2022-10-24 06:45:52+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>893.1</strong> —–2022-10-24 18:28:41+08:00:</p>

<p>This is one of those cases where the answer can be quite short or quite complicated depending on how and how far you want to engage with the dimensions of the issue. I am most certainly not an economic historian, and my contact with the Great Divergence scholarship has generally been pretty tangential. However, there are interesting discussions to be had here about historiographical matters, and also about how Wikipedia editors can sometimes weave historiographical debates from whole cloth.</p>

<p>So, to get the economics side out of the way and to answer the question as phrased, the majority of Anglophone historians writing on the Great Divergence essentially reject the notion that the Qing conquest represented a permanent disruption to the Chinese economy or to its technological and scientific spheres. To quote just a few historians on this count who frankly understand the issues far better than I do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is worth noting, for instance, that Chinese interest in the physical sciences and mathematics increased markedly in the seventeenth century, especially after the Manchu conquest in 1644-68, and that publishers found that medical books were a particularly good way to sell lots of books, fulfill a commitment to improve the world through their work, and steer clear of the post-conquest minefields of political controversy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Pomeranz, <em>The Great Divergence</em> (2000), p. 44</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the economic decline initiated by the Ming rebellions followed by the disruptions caused by the Manchu invasion, the eighteenth century witnessed the resettlement of deserted land, the opening of new fields, and a renewed commercial expansion spanning even larger portions of the empire. Economic growth in the middle and upper Yangzi regions complemented growth in the lower Yangzi. Parts of North and Northwest China also increased production. The dynamics of Smithian expansion were present throughout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– R Bin Wong, <em>China Transformed</em> (2001), p. 21</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The upheavals of the late Ming rebellions and the Manchu con quest hindered growth in most of the seventeenth century, so that by 1700 the population still did not exceed 160 million. Then in the course of the eighteenth century it more than doubled, from some 160 million in 1700 to 350 million in 1800 – an unprecedented gain of nearly 200 million people. Yet standards of living were apparently higher in the eighteenth century than they had been a century earlier. Sustaining such a massive population increase without a substantial decline in living standards implies a lifting of Malthusian constraints – something usually associated only with “modern” economic growth. Thus to dismiss the early and high Qing economic increase as “merely” extensive growth misstates an extraordinary achievement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Jack Goldstone, ‘Efflorescences and Economic Growth in World History: Rethinking the “Rise of the West” and the Industrial Revolution’ (2002), p. 351</p>

<p>What is <em>interesting</em>, however, is that much of this core Anglophone scholarship suggesting that the underlying basis of the Qing economy remained decently strong through the eighteenth century <em>pre</em>dates the spate of Chinese historians offering explanations for Qing economic weakness without necessarily providing firm evidence for that weakness actually being extant. The Wikipedia editors’ inclusion of Kenneth Pomeranz’s critique of what we might term the ‘Qing Conquest Theory’ is absolutely fascinating because at least one of the articles (Xu’s) appears to directly respond to it. But in turn, there is little to suggest that the Anglophone historiography has felt the need to respond to this spate of Chinese-language scholarship, which appears to find roots in a particular strand of nativist and ethnic nationalist interpretations of Chinese history, wherein ‘foreign conquest dynasties’ like the Mongol Yuan and Manchu Qing are moralistically denigrated for their foreignness.</p>

<p>What the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Qing_conquest_theory">talk page</a> of the Wikipedia article reveals is that this page’s survival appears to have been largely contingent on a failure to successfully mobilise a strong front against its continued existence on the site, despite the page being marked as unreliable since August 2010. Both in 2010 (shortly after its creation) and in 2021, there have been extensive arguments over whether the article ought to exist at all, and even if it does, whether the title is misleading in asserting the existence of a particular theory under a term that appears to have been coined by the original author of the Wikipedia page, with no attestations in the Chinese or Anglophone scholarship cited. Per the 2021 discussion however, the term has leaked into some publications in the years since 2010, in a textbook case of what the webcomic xkcd termed <a href="https://xkcd.com/978/">‘citogenesis’</a> – a bad-faith or clueless user puts an unverified or even unverifiable fact up on the internet, which a later good-faith reader replicates in a more formal publication, which then gets cited retroactively to support the original claim.</p>

<p>So, the question of ‘is the Qing conquest theory true’ actually holds an unexpected double meaning – not just whether what it purports to claim is correct, but also whether there is such a thing as a ‘Qing conquest theory’. Now, on that count, I would argue that <em>yes</em>, there <em>is</em> such a thing, insofar as one can point to a body of Chinese-language scholarship that does genuinely argue that the Qing conquest of China in the 1640s and subsequent Qing policy within China were a cause of economic and scientific stagnation or even decline, and one can coin a term to describe it. ‘Qing conquest theory’ would not be an unreasonable term to impose in that it does literally encompass what these historians argue.</p>

<p>The problematic aspect to this discussion is ultimately the way that this has entered the online space. A Wikipedian decided around 2010 that their characterisation of a body of Chinese scholarship was deserving of an article, and the end result was something that mostly replicated the arguments in those articles (especially Xu (2005), who is cited a whopping 12 times in an article with 42 total citations, except the link to the cited article is dead) without a full examination of how other scholars reacted to it – quite possibly because few specialists outside China <em>cared</em> about stuff that was mostly nationalist nonsense. What we now have is an article whose genesis lies with one particular person more than a decade ago, and which has essentially <em>never</em> been updated to discuss more modern scholarship – you will note that its bibliography includes nothing in Chinese more recent than 2010, and nothing in English more recent than 2007. It’s not that we cannot speak of such a concept, but its current articulation on the internet is extremely problematic.</p>

<p>—– <strong>893.2</strong> —–2022-10-24 22:22:55+08:00:</p>

<p>These aren’t actually related though. That there is not post-2010 historiography that deals in depth with claims about Qing rule’s effect on the Chinese economy doesn’t mean you can’t still analyse this mid-2000s historical writing in light of other trends relating to ‘New Qing’ history,  such as what I discuss in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gh01vp/why_is_there_such_antipathy_to_new_qing_history/fq73fra/">this past answer</a>, albeit mainly reckoning with the argument from the other end – that Qing rule’s legitimation through appeals to Chinese tradition entailed a fundamental continuity with pre- and post-Qing regimes. It’s not like you can’t tell from the arguments made by the articles that there is clearly tendentious work being done based on quite easily identifiable motives. It’s like saying you can’t dismiss Niall Ferguson as an apologist for the British Empire unless an academic specifically writes a response to one of his books.</p>

<p>—– <strong>893.3</strong> —–2022-10-24 23:27:10+08:00:</p>

<p>So, the problem with discussing the Qing within a Chinese context is that modern, post-imperial China simultaneously owes its geographical scope to the Qing Empire, and owes its political form to a revolt against the Qing Empire. At the same time, there is the problem of Han Sinocentrism at work and just… <em>very complicated</em> ethnic politics, such that there are conflicting priorities over whether the Qing ought to be presented as a period of ethnic harmony or one of Manchu-led oppression. As such there are two conflicting lines on how to interpret the Qing from a moralistic perspective: either the Qing were essentially foreign and pursued policies that fatally weakened China, or the Qing were highly ‘Sinicised’ and belong to a grand continuum of Chinese states. The popularities of these two perspectives wax and wane at their own pace, but the perspective held by Western historians – that we ought to understand the Qing in terms that are <em>not</em> moralistic or centred on China’s national experience – simply doesn’t have purchase in a context where history is still understood as having a concrete instrumental function as an elucidation and justification of the nation-state as it currently exists, just as it was in 19th and early 20th century Europe and America.</p>

<p>—– <strong>893.4</strong> —–2022-10-25 05:12:40+08:00:</p>

<p>So that’s all fair – again, as said, I’m not an economic historian and I’m not claiming that I know the modern historiography well. <em>That said</em>, the problem with the ‘Qing conquest thesis’ is that from what can be gleaned (the articles are not always still accessible), A) they don’t actually give a strong case for the existence of economic disparity and have been at best vindicated retrospectively; B) they attribute it to deliberately obfuscatory Qing policy, which is the primary point of contention and which, as you say, is not supported by even the modern scholarship; and C) if the Qing conquest alone were the cause of a major economic decline, it would manifest in the 1640s and not as a stagnation starting in the 1700s-50s. So even if the revised scholarship would agree that Chinese economic parity ended sooner than 1800, it would still fundamentally not agree with the nationalist scholarship claiming it was directly the result of the Qing conquest and discriminatory policy agendas. I agree, by the by, that the structural causes of disparity would have predated the disparity, but that is also something very much conceded by the historians at the turn of the millennium, for the most part.</p>

<p>—– <strong>893.5</strong> —–2022-10-26 00:41:11+08:00:</p>

<p>Well, that is also an argument some historians have deployed, but there is still an argument to be had that no, it is worth asking what kind of bad luck was involved, and how to rationalise that ‘luck’ into a series of concrete factors. So take for instance Pomeranz’s argument that it was European polities being able to extract wealth from their colonies to offset what would otherwise have been the limits of their growth in pure Malthusian terms. Now that explanation is not uncontroversial and elements have been walked back by Pomeranz over the years, but it is still some attempt to explain how the Industrial Revolution <em>did</em> happen, on the assumption that it was not an inevitability across societies.</p>

<p>—– <strong>894.1</strong> —–2022-10-24 17:01:29+08:00:</p>

<p>The two relatively standard recommendations are the late Jonathan Spence’s <em>The Search for Modern China</em> (3rd edition 2012) and Pamela Kyle Crossley’s <em>The Wobbling Pivot – China Since 1800: an Interpretive History</em> (1st ed. 2010). Each has its upsides and downsides.</p>

<p>Spence’s book is decidedly more narrative, with a certain running theme being its reckoning with the idea of ‘modernity’ and what it means in a Chinese context. His coverage begins in the late Ming and goes up to the then-present, so covers a period about twice as long as Crossley, but the book is also proportionately longer to match. Spence was one of the best prose writers among Anglophone historians, and indeed one of few academic historians of China whose work was read widely outside academic circles, and in that regard the book is incredibly readable. Spence wrote the first edition right on the cusp of the ‘New Qing’ turn that significantly reframed much of what we understand about the Qing empire, and as a result even in the later editions there may be the odd interpretive quibble coming from the more Manchucentric wings of the Qing history profession, but it is broadly speaking still quite solid and relevant historiographically.</p>

<p>Crossley’s book is distinctly more theoretical and interpretive, and its intended audience is somewhat more scholarly if not necessarily narrowly academic. Her writing style can occasionally be a bit obtuse when she gets into highly theoretical or analytical topics, but this is much less pronounced in <em>The Wobbling Pivot</em> than some of her other writings (<em>A Translucent Mirror</em> is the most egregious example cited). Crossley also makes the odd albeit often inconsequential factual error, especially when covering post-Qing subjects, while her coverage of Cixi’s political ascendancy takes a relatively strong view of Cixi as being functionally irrelevant, in contrast to most historians who afford her at least some degree of influence in one or more spheres of power (see for instance Edward Rhoads’ <em>Manchus and Han</em>). It’s a somewhat mixed bag, but serves as a pretty good primer on the period covered, with a focus on bringing approaches and lenses of analysis from the Qing period forward into the 20th and 21st centuries, and suggesting that fundamental continuities persisted past the more superficially apparent disruptions of the Republican and Communist revolutions.</p>

<p>—– <strong>894.2</strong> —–2022-10-25 05:14:03+08:00:</p>

<p>The second edition was 1999 while the third was 2012, so it depends how much you care about the 13 years in between, mainly. I also don’t know if there were revisions in between to account for the major spate of revisionist work on the Qing that mostly came out ca. 1998-2005, so while I can’t guarantee the third edition is more up to date on that, I can guarantee the second won’t be.</p>

<p>—– <strong>894.3</strong> —–2022-12-21 14:16:38+08:00:</p>

<p>Sorry, I don’t really go past 1911, but I’m glad you’re enjoying Spence!</p>

<p>Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework">/r/AskHistorians isn’t here to do your homework for you</a>. However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question.

Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<p>The first known appearance of Hong Xiuquan (the Taiping Heavenly King) in the written record is in a missionary gazette from 1847 printed in Kentucky. Issachar Roberts, a Tennesseean missionary whom Hong studied with for a few months in 1846, sent back a letter to friends in the US about how remarkable it was that he had met a man who had converted to Christianity after a series of visions, which Roberts himself believed to be fully genuine. Hong would not reappear in the textual record until 1851, when Hong Rengan (a cousin who had briefly accompanied Hong Xiuquan with Roberts) wrote a short testimony of his experiences.</p>

<p>A guy calling himself Jesus’ younger brother nearly overthrew the Qing government in China in the 1850s. I know that’s the really annoying oversimplified version that I hate but it is nevertheless substantively true.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.5</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:21:42+08:00:</p>

<p>The Daoguang Emperor, who (in)famously issued a major series of opium prohibition policies in 1836, may actually have smoked it himself when he was younger, although it’s ambiguous whether he was smoking <em>madak</em> (opium-laced tobacco) or just plain tobacco.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.6</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:23:20+08:00:</p>

<p>The oft-repeated factoid that Chinggis’ bloodline is so widespread because of his repeated acts of sexual violence is not even supported by the article people cite for it. The article suggests that if it is indeed true, it is mostly attributable to the fact that male-line descendants of Chinggis held a privileged position in many post-Mongol societies, which encouraged having more children in Chinggisid families.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.7</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:27:27+08:00:</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.8</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:29:27+08:00:</p>

<p>The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk and the 1727 Treaty of Kiakhta, which defined the border between the Qing and Russian empires, were composed in Latin thanks to the presence of Jesuit interpreters in the Qing court. Official derived versions in Russian and Manchu were also produced, although not in Chinese.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.9</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:32:48+08:00:</p>

<p>Luo Dagang, a pirate who joined the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, may well have been a Christian convert even before the Taiping turned up. According to a British report containing a translation of a letter from Luo in 1853, he was a bit of a collaborator with the British during their occupation of Guangzhou during the Opium War in 1840-42 and helped build churches during that time.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.10</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:37:36+08:00:</p>

<p>Scottish solidarity contributed heavily to a major diplomatic near-crisis. The Napier Affair of 1834 almost saw Britain go to war with the Qing empire thanks to aggressive policies to increase British trade access in China being pushed by British opium merchants and supported by the new British trade superintendent, Napier. It is quite possible that the reason Napier, born in Ireland but from a Scottish family and a member of the Scottish peerage, was so favourable towards the smugglers, was that he ended up forming a close rapport with the two main opium merchants in Canton – William Jardine (born in rural Dumfrieshire) and James Matheson (born in Lairg in Sutherland). Thankfully for most involved – except perhaps himself – Napier died of malaria before diplomatic tension boiled over into outright war.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.11</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:41:18+08:00:</p>

<p>The Ottomans have had some notable entanglements with Xinjiang separatism. Yaqub Beg, a Kokandi general who invaded Xinjiang during its revolt against the Qing in the 1860s and held onto the region until his death in 1877, was formally made Emir of Kashgar by an edict of Sultan Abdülaziz in 1873 and minted coins in the latter’s name. Later on, Prince Abdülkerim of the deposed family attempted to start a Turanist movement from Xinjiang in 1932 and received an informal but not inconsiderable amount of support from Japan, but was quickly expelled by local warlords and died in exile in New York at the age of 29.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.12</strong> —–2022-10-29 02:47:53+08:00:</p>

<p>The Taiping have at least three weird connections with the military history of 1860s Japan. Takasugi Shinsaku of Chōshū, whom some consider to have been the founder of what would become the Imperial Japanese Army, may have been inspired by the Qing use of militias in his decision to form rifle units composed of peasants as well as samurai. Henry Burgevine, an American mercenary commander who had fought for the Qing, defected to the Taiping, and then went into exile, made several petitions to Japanese domains to train up their armies, and eventually ended up briefly working for Chōshū before being duped by a steamer captain into being taken to Shanghai, where the Qing arrested him for breaking the terms of his exile, and he may have been quietly murdered afterward. The Satsuma domain warship <em>Kasuga</em> was originally the <em>Keangsoo</em>, a 6-gun corvette – and the fastest armed ship in the world – that served as the flagship of the Lay-Osborn Flotilla, a small brown-water squadron assembled by British investors to support the Qing war effort, but which was refused by the Qing after it became clear that Horatio Lay (its creator) intended to command it entirely independently. It ended up in Japanese hands after being anchored in Bombay for two years, as the American consul in China had insisted it be removed from Shanghai to prevent it being obtained by Confederate privateers.</p>

<p><em>Shatranj ke Khilari</em> (<em>The Chess Players</em>) is the only feature-length film by Satyajit Ray to be in Hindi rather than Bengali; it’s also one of a handful of his films to actually depict a specific real historical event, that being the 1856 annexation of the Indian state of Awadh (Oudh) by the East India Company on the eve of the Rebellion. It’s also a fantastic film that’s well worth watching!</p>

<p>So the weird thing is that AskHistorians invented the 20-year rule to make moderation easier. There is no <em>actual</em> 20-year rule in real life. Also as far as AskHistorians is concerned it ticks over every year rather than every day. And it’s kind of a 19-year rule. So you can talk about the history of any point in 2003 from 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.15</strong> —–2022-10-29 06:26:43+08:00:</p>

<p>The word ‘chopsticks’ may have entered English thanks to Chinese Pidgin English, which developed between speakers of Cantonese and English in southern China in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Cantonese for chopsticks is 筷子 <em>faai3 zi2</em>, or just 筷 <em>faai3</em> in a literary context, which is a homophone of 快 <em>faai3</em>, ‘fast’. ‘Chop chop’ being a Pidgin term for ‘fast’, it’s possible that ‘chop sticks’ as a term for Chinese eating utensils was a result of this homophone.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.16</strong> —–2022-10-29 06:29:40+08:00:</p>

<p>To paraphrase from an earlier fact in the thread, the first treaties between the Qing Empire and Russia (Nerchinsk in 1689 and Kiakhta in 1727) were composed in Latin, then translated to Russian and Manchu. The Qing court included several Jesuit advisors who served as Latin interpreters, which is how that managed to happen. That said, Peter Perdue has pointed out that it is interesting how the Jesuits inserted themselves into the process, as the Russians and the Qing could just as well – indeed, potentially more easily – used Mongolian as an intermediary language.</p>

<p>The original ‘Six-Day War’ was in 1899, when several rural villages in the New Territories of Hong Kong, leased to Britain the previous year, rose up in revolt in a pre-emptive protest against land reform. An estimated 500 villagers died, but their aims were ultimately somewhat achieved – the governor and the local commander-in-chief had been blindsided by the more junior military officers who carried out the war, and quickly offered a package of concessions which, in largely similar form, would end up being baked into the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s current, nominally-still-active local constitution) during the handover process in the ’80s and ’90s. The war was also essentially covered up and virtually never spoken of again in official documents.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.19</strong> —–2022-10-29 06:35:14+08:00:</p>

<p>Stephen Platt argues that the American Civil War was the ultimate cause of Anglo-French intervention in the Taiping War in China: the sudden contraction of the American market led to the European empires attempting to restore political stability in China to stabilise commerce there.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.20</strong> —–2022-10-29 06:42:02+08:00:</p>

<p>The Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682 but this was actively covered up by the Tibetan government until 1696; 10 years later the Sixth Dalai Lama would soon be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fgj1vr/whats_the_story_behind_the_murder_of_the_6th/fk7d36c/">deposed under murky circumstances and probably murdered</a>.

<p>Napoleon attributed his first major field defeat at Aspern-Essling in 1809 to ‘General Danube’ – the Austrians had found a floating watermill up river from where the French had established their pontoon bridges over the Danube, and basically let it loose down the river where it smashed the bridges and split the French army in half. Had the Austrians known they had been successful and pressed the attack, Napoleon’s entire campaign might have been ruined – along with about a quarter of the French army.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.24</strong> —–2022-10-29 07:10:04+08:00:</p>

<p>Between 1883 and 1889, a (likely fraudulent) Cossack named Nikolai Ashinov made repeated attempts to bolster Ethiopia against its various rivals on the basis that Ethiopia was a fellow Orthodox polity that Russia ought to defend against its new Catholic neighbours (Italy and France now having interest in the region). Ashinov was, weirdly, already a fugitive from Russia, but had managed to win over a decent amount of private support among civil servants and military officers with which to fund his activities. He also got a lucky break by defrauding the British, as he offered to start a Cossack insurgency against the Russians in Central Asia, only to end up absconding to Ethiopia (which is how he first got there). His ignominious career culminated in his attempt to lead a couple of hundred Cossacks and their followers to establish the town of ‘New Moscow’ on the site of an abandoned Egyptian fort in Somaliland called Sagallo in December 1888, but he was kicked out by the French after less than a month for intruding on their claimed turf.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.25</strong> —–2022-10-29 07:24:48+08:00:</p>

<p>When Lord Macartney went on his (in)famous embassy to China in 1793, he went casting around for Chinese interpreters, and found a pair of Chinese priests in Rome who were orphans that had been taken in by Catholic missionaries. When the ships arrived off Macau, one of the two immediately jumped overboard and swam for shore.</p>

<p>According to Arrian, Alexander only ever drank in the company of friends, and only ever in moderation. He is the only Alexander biographer to make this claim and is frankly lying through his teeth.</p>

<p>The historian Jamie Belich attributes the New Zealand Musket Wars in part to the introduction of potatoes, which gave Māori chiefs additional agricultural surplus and thus more ability to wage war; this coincided with a huge drop in arms prices after the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p>Dim sum is a specifically Cantonese form of cuisine, so its fortunes in North America have waxed and waned with the relative strength of Cantonese communities over time. While quite prominent in the 1920s-40s, there was an extended period in the mid-1920s when American Chinese food was dominated more by Taiwanese immigrants (themselves from a diverse geographic background thanks to the post-Civil War evacuations), and dim sum would not see a major resurgence in terms of its relative prominence until emigration from Hong Kong in the 1980s.</p>

<p>York served as the Royalist capital for a portion of the First English Civil War, being where Charles I raised the royal standard after fleeing London in January 1642. The seat of government effectively relocated to Oxford from January 1644 as the alignment of the Scottish Covenanters with the Parliamentarians made the Royalist position in the North increasingly untenable.</p>

<p>A Flemish astronomer named Ferdinand Verbiest helped the teenaged Kangxi Emperor and his grandmother overthrow Oboi, the head of the young ruler’s regency council, in 1669, by proving that the regents had been miscalculating key dates.</p>

<p>A rather unusual semi-religious movement emerged during the Taiping War which placed great importance on the sanctity of the written word. Among other practices, it advocated not using paper that had been written on as toilet paper, and called for putting an end to having words on the underside of pottery, as this would, supposedly, literally debase the written word in so doing.</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.32</strong> —–2022-10-31 18:46:42+08:00:</p>

<p>A key event in Hong Kong’s early colonial history was the Esing Bakery poisoning of 1857, in which a batch of bread laced with white arsenic led to as many as 500 people being taken ill, although ultimately only three people died of complications over the next year or so. While this might seem innocuous at first blush, this was only three months after the <em>Arrow</em> incident sent Britain and the Qing down the path to another war, which led the white community in Hong Kong to be particularly paranoid that the Chinese population would engage in various acts of sabotage. The fact that the owner of the bakery, Cheong A-Lum, left for Macau the afternoon of the poisoning did not help his case, but he was, amazingly, found not guilty at trial. However, governor John Bowring stretched his executive authority to keep Cheong detained, but a petition by the Chinese community to the Acting Colonial Secretary, William Bridges, secured his release, and he left for China, where he vanished from record.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that there is still not really a good idea of <em>why</em> the poisoning happened. Cheong doesn’t seem to have intentionally carried out the poisoning, as he had made orders for flour for several days in advance – not the behaviour of a man who was about to commit a crime and run. Nor was it likely that there were Qing-backed saboteurs, as documents seized from the provincial archives during the ensuing Arrow War showed that the Qing office that had been set up for clandestine operations was actually completely caught off guard by the attack. One possibility is industrial espionage by one of the major white European bakers envious of Cheong’s success and his lucrative government contracts: in the event, most of the contracts that had gone to Cheong ended up going to a Portuguese baker. But still possible is that a sack of white arsenic brought in for use as rat poison had been confused for flour. The case for it being an accident on those grounds is actually quite strong: the amount of arsenic was so high that people vomited up the tainted bread rather than digesting it, which was used as an explanation for why the proportion of fatal cases was so low. Then again, we can always imagine an industrial saboteur not wanting to poison his future customers.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, an interesting little episode.</p>

<p>It’s all a lie by the Phoenicians! Tyre relocated itself to Central Asia and invented the mudfloods to conceal its secret plots…</p>

<p>—– <strong>903.34</strong> —–2022-11-06 17:25:23+08:00:</p>

<p>I’ve written about this portrait <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/phr4fn/saturday_showcase_september_04_2021/hbkbr8l/">before on the sub</a>, but to distill out the key points:</p>

<p>There was a surprisingly strong set of intellectual ties between the Kingdom of France and the Qing Empire under the Kangxi and Yongzheng Emperors, with Catholic reports about the Qing court inspiring Voltaire to write admiringly of the former ruler as ‘China’s Sun King’, while knowledge of the French court made its way to the Qing as well, not just through missionaries but also through private merchants. It’s important to understand that Qing trade policy was protectionist, not isolationist: huge volumes of cargo moved through Canton (Guangzhou), and this cargo was moved by people. Moreover, there was a massive market for commissioned porcelainware, which saw the imperial kiln complex at Jingdezhen turn out huge quantities of bowls, plates, and teacups (among other items) with European designs. So both ideas about Europe and European aesthetic influences disseminated quite widely.</p>

<p>What this also led to, somewhat inexplicably, was a strange bit of religious iconography, wherein one of the forms that could be taken by a Bodhisattva in Qing-era religious art was a European nobleman. In the Kangxi-era woodblock album <em>Fifty-Three Transformation Bodies of Guanyin</em>, the goddess Guanyin (Avalokitasvara) appears in one image as a moustachioed gentleman with a sceptre, seemingly modelled on portraits of Louis XIII. This gives some context to the Yongzheng Emperor’s appearance in Bourbon garb in the tiger-hunting image, as he may have been seeking to evoke the imagery of the Maitreya tradition. In particular, one of Maitreya’s heralds in Chinese Mahayana, the Eighteen Arhats, is the Tiger-Tamer or Tiger-Subduer, who is sometimes associated with Maitreya himself, leading to a number of Qing depictions of Maitreya as a tiger-slayer. The album in which the Yongzheng Emperor’s tiger hunt appears, descriptively titled <em>The Yongzheng Emperor in Costumes</em>, can be read as inserting itself into this trend of religious art, drawing a similarity between the emperor’s ability to switch costumes and roles and the ability of Bodhisattvas to change forms, and in turn, it quite likely drew on the precedent for depicting one such form as a European aristocrat.</p>

<p>Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth">rules concerning the scope of questions</a>. However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.</p>

<p>So for example, if you wanted to ask, “<em>Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?</em>” we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask “<em>In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?</em>” we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

<p>Mid-sized drama from the middle leagues of the EN VTuber space:</p>

<p>For a while, CyberLive was one of the five agencies that one r/VirtualYoutubers user nicknamed the ‘Pettan Five’, a group of mid-sized agencies whose members were generally in the five-digit range in terms of sub counts: not big players with general-audience popularity like Hololive, Nijisanji, or VShojo, but definitely very noticeable within the overall VTuber space. (The others, for context, are Tsunderia, Phase-Connect, PRISM Project, and Production Kawaii.) CyberLive’s first, five-member generation debuted in July 2021, and its second (also of five), including its (relative) breakout member Oumiya Emma, debuted in December.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there seem to have been management issues quite early on, with the main public-facing manager, Sato Misaki, apparently just not doing her job, to the point of failing to do stuff for the agency that actively cost it money. This led to her being publicly terminated in late March this year. This came amid a spate of talent departures: Ayane Hylo went independent in early February, Kaneko Lumi and Amaris Yuri transferred to Phase-Connect in early March (about two weeks before Sato Misaki’s termination), and Kurohana Inori left to go independent in mid-May. Shortly before Inori’s departure, CyberLive officially rebranded itself as Aetheria, ostensibly switching from an agency format to an indie network, with manager Vera Vee retaining some management role and also becoming a public-facing talent.</p>

<p>Well, now allegations have come out about Vera Vee leaking private conversations with the Aetheria members, taking advantage of fans, and having an affair with a Cyberlive/Aetheria Discord mod. While these are just allegations from the mod in question at present, and frankly kind of questionable in terms of provenance, this has led to Vera Vee deleting her Twitter account, and Aetheria announcing its official dissolution as of 30 October.

<p>[SS from the essay by Samuel Charap, Senior Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation; and Miranda Priebe, Senior Political Scientist and Director of the Center for Analysis of U.S. Grand Strategy at the RAND Corporation.]</p>

<p>Barring regime change, the likely pathways forward given current Ukrainian, U.S. and allied policies are either Russian escalation, as noted above, or a conflict of indefinite duration. A protracted war could benefit Washington to the extent that it weakens Moscow and forces it to pare back its ambitions elsewhere. But a war that drags on would also have significant downsides for the United States. It would continue to eat up military and financial resources as well as the time and energy of U.S. policymakers, diminishing Washington’s ability to prioritize long-term strategic competition with China. A protracted conflict would likely also sustain the deep freeze in U.S.-Russian relations, potentially jeopardizing cooperation between Washington and Moscow on issues of global importance, such as arms control.<br />
A long war would also disrupt the global economy. The United States’ most important trading partners and allies in Europe would be the hardest hit, mainly because of higher energy prices. And, of course, the country that would suffer the most—in terms of lives lost, infrastructure destroyed, and economic devastation—is Ukraine. Even a conflict that continues at a lower level of intensity would disrupt the economy and scare off investment, complicating the country’s economic recovery.<br />
In an op-ed in The New York Times in May, Biden wrote that U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was intended to put the country’s leaders in “in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.” Quoting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he wrote that “ultimately this war ‘will only definitively end through diplomacy.’” Five months later, that diplomacy has yet to materialize—a fact for which Russia bears primary responsibility.<br />
But the United States could be doing more to enable diplomacy.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-10-24~2022-10-30的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-26/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-10-24~2022-10-30的言论" /><published>2022-10-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-26/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-26/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>College and University technically mean different things, but they’re used interchangeably to refer to undergraduate education.  An undergraduate, who attends either a college or a university declares a “major” that is the subject area they primarily focus on (e.g., biology, chemistry, history or math).  An undergraduate may also select a “minor” that is a subject area they concentrate on, with less focus than the major.  It is usually not necessary to declare a major or select a minor, in your first undergraduate year.  Undergraduates typically obtain “Bachelor of Science” or “Bachelor of Arts” degrees.</p>

<p>Graduate “Grad” School refers to post-undergraduate education.  A grad student could attend a professional school, like law, business or medical school.  Also, a grad student could pursue higher degrees in specific subject areas called a “Masters Degree” or “Ph.D.”</p>

<p>To attend law or business school, you need to have an undergraduate degree.  To have an undergraduate degree, you typically need to have completed primary schooling (elementary, middle and high school).  Elementary school through high school lasts twelve years.  Undergraduate usually lasts four years.  Law school lasts three years.  Business school can be completed at different rates, depending on your program.</p>

<p>—– <strong>885.1</strong> —–2022-10-18 02:23:54+08:00:</p>

<p>So as ever, it is worth prefacing by noting that there has been a move by some historians of Central Asia quite recently to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jsb5my/whats_the_state_of_scholarship_on_the_silk_road/">do away with the ‘Silk Road’ concept</a>, amid a more general complication and problematisation of the idea that’s gone on for decades. The reason you are unlikely to find accounts of <em>The</em> Silk Road is that there never actually was one – long-distance movement of goods was never really an intentional process on a specific route, but rather the emergent property of numerous intersecting local trade networks. Scott C. Levi’s book in the linked answer, <em>The Bukharan Crisis</em>, is the most concentrated deconstruction of both the traditional and revised ‘Silk Road’ concepts out there, and my first recommendation.</p>

<p>That said, it’s not as though there were not still phenomena that get pointed to as forming part of the ‘Silk Road’ in practice, and for that, Valerie Hansen’s <em>The Silk Road: A New History</em> (2012) is probably your best bet for an academically solid general overview of trade networks and connections in premodern Eurasia. Frances Wood’s <em>The Silk Road: Two Thousand Years in the Heart of Asia</em> (2002)… <em>exists</em>, but I’ve not read it myself, and Wood also became rather infamous among historians of China for her insistence that Marco Polo never went there, which is generally regarded as pseudohistory these days. Even less recommended – i.e. not at all – is Peter Frankopan’s <em>The Silk Roads</em> (2015), which is half a work of Big History, and half focussed on Iran, ironically at the expense of the traditional ‘Silk Road’ regions of Central Asia. In all honesty, there is surprisingly little else. The ‘Silk Road’ is so taken for granted as an aspect of Eurasian history that there are actually quite few good treatments of it out there.</p>

<p>That said, if you’re interested in the more general political history of the region, then James Millward’s <em>Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang</em> (2006) is still the definitive treatment of the history of western Central Asia, while Christopher Beckwith’s <em>Empires of the Silk Road</em> is a good overview of the steppe empires and the polities of southern Central Asia.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting question, though one where you’ve missed a rather important element. But we can get into that in a bit. It is worth suggesting that ‘Imperial China’ really refers more to a political tradition than a geopolitical entity here, and that the thing that outright fell apart was the Qing Empire, a specific imperial entity that claimed a certain ideological continuity within that political tradition (at least within its Chinese territories), but was not exactly simply a new iteration of previous China-ruling empires. Identity and identity policy within the Qing Empire was a matter of some complexity, over which there is no real firm academic consensus. The view I present here is synthesised from multiple academic sources, but as a synthesis it is firmly my own, and not all will agree with the combination of elements I have attempted to reconcile.</p>

<p>The Qing Empire is perhaps best described as a composite entity, comprising a multitude of political sub-formations, some more self-contained and others more overlapping. The one thing that gave it all some sort of unison and coherence was a shared monarch, and by extension a set – if a variable, inconsistently-applied, and sometimes quite limited one – of central institutions and controls. In a sense, it is very much a reasonable question to ask why the empire did not break into those constituent components the way that, say, the British Empire did.</p>

<p>For that we must provide at least some background. Qing rule was predicated on a tense duality, in which the court navigated between two somewhat opposing philosophies. The first was universalism: the idea that the Qing state, embodied in the person of the emperor, appealed equally to all its constituents, appearing to show favour to each group within its own context while not actually exercising any particular preference for any one set of cultural values or political traditions. The second was what Mark Elliott terms ‘ethnic sovereignty’: the notion that Qing rule was predicated on the continued coherence of a core ethnic group (the Manchus) that served the emperor as a group of loyal functionaries, motivated principally by a common sense of in-group identity. This was not an inherent contradiction, insofar as one could theoretically create that kind of in-group identity without appearing to make that in-group outwardly privileged. Indeed, one could argue that the Qing managed to thread this needle for most of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>But universalism did not mean that the empire simply divorced itself from the process of identity construction. Indeed, it was in the empire’s interests that it communicated with a limited set of discrete constituencies to whom messages could be tailored on an individual basis, as opposed to a broad continuum of identities with lots of fuzzy liminal spaces. Under the Qianlong Emperor in particular, a number of decisions were taken that can be understood as aimed at disambiguating certain identity groups and enforcing a baseline of common identity and ideology within each. The most-discussed in the literature is the disbanding of most of the Han Banners and reclassifying them as either ‘civilian’ Han or as Manchus (though we ought not to overstate this, as a considerable rump of Han Bannermen remained). But we can also point to the genocide against the Zunghars in 1756-7, who did not self-identify as Mongols but whom the Qing regarded as a Mongol subgroup that nevertheless refused to submit to Qing overlordship; or to the Jinchuan Wars of 1747-9 and 1771-6, which were fought to assert control over Tibetan-speaking tribes who were adherents of either ‘Red Hat’ Buddhist sects or of Bön syncretism, and thus in opposition to the ‘Yellow Hat’ Gelug school that dominated most of Tibet proper and served as the Qing’s official ‘state religion’ in much of Inner Asia. In broad terms, the Qing settled on five principal constituents: Manchus, Han, Tibetans, Mongols, and Muslims (the last of which was a somewhat shifting term that in Qing usage originally only meant <em>Turkic</em> Muslims, before encompassing the broad set of Muslim ethnic groups).</p>

<p>It is here that we also ought to bring up the problem of groups for whom the Qing did <em>not</em> attempt to create a coherent identity package. Indigenous groups of various sorts, primarily concentrated in south China and Taiwan, were never the objects of significant Qing attempts at identify reification, for numerous reasons: they lacked the written historical and genealogical traditions that the major constituent peoples had; there was no single common religion or lingua franca; there was no history of broader statehood outside Yunnan, and even then not a recent one. If early Qing ethnic policy around the Manchus was centred on maintaining a sense of ‘coherence’, then an inverted situation existed with south Chinese and Taiwanese indigenous peoples, who were, in Qing eyes, ‘incoherent’, lacking any of the markers that the empire’s ‘civilised’ constituents used to demonstrate and maintain their own identities. Even so, the Qing didn’t necessarily treat these peoples as being of no interest: while the Qing did acquiesce to Han Chinese land-grabbing in the early 18th century, for most of the Qianlong reign there were attempts to limit Han encroachments on indigenous land, some of which were not maintained (particularly in Yunnan, which saw huge Han migration after about 1750), and some of which were (particularly on Taiwan, where settlement remained heavily constrained until the 1860s).</p>

<p>The eventual collapse of the Qing Empire can be attributed to the breakdown of both sides of the universalist-ethnic duality, due to the same root factor: the growth of the power of Han Chinese interests at the expense of other constituents. When to date this transition from is an open question. As noted, Qing acquiescence to Han migration and colonisation in Yunnan dated back to the 1750s, and led to huge demographic changes at the expense of Muslim and indigenous populations. The Qianlong Emperor’s introduction of the Golden Urn in 1793, one of the most significant measures in Qing control of Tibet, was justified with appeals to Ming precedents rather than to Tibetan or Manchu practice. After the Jiaqing Emperor assumed full power in 1799, Manchu dominance of provincial government eroded in favour of a slim Han majority, and the powers of the Manchu-dominated imperial court were reduced in favour of the now much more Han-centric provincial authorities. Han colonisation further afield became not only tacitly permitted but indeed openly sponsored, beginning with Xinjiang in the late 1820s, then Manchuria from the mid-1850s, Taiwan from the late 1860s, and Inner Mongolia in the 1900s. This period also saw the rise of Han strongmen within the Qing government such as Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang, who had been granted immense authority as a result of Qing desperation for strong local leaders during the Taiping War in the 1850s and 60s. But whatever and whenever you point to as the crucial tipping point, by at least the 1880s it would have been an unavoidable conclusion that the Han Chinese had gained the upper hand in the empire’s politics.</p>

<p>Now, ethnic groups do not function as monolithic blocs, and the increasing consolidation of power by Han officials within the existing imperial bureaucracy did not magically appease various Han interest groups like the Constitutionalists and the Republicans, who agitated for further political change. Although both groups were ostensibly purely interested in matters of constitutional politics if we just go by the names, they were also overtly motivated by ethnic politics. Powerful as the Han bureaucrats were, Han Chinese dissident and opposition groups insisted that a complete overhaul – or even overthrow – of the system of imperial government as it then existed was called for, in order that Han control over China would be assured.</p>

<p>But as the prospect of such an event became more seriously considered, especially amid the actual coming of the revolution in 1911, a critical question had to be reckoned with: should a state formed by the Han as a repudiation of Manchu rule nevertheless inherit the former empire’s territorial scope, and if so, how? There were those who argued ‘no’: Zhang Binglin, for instance, argued that the Qing’s Inner Asian territories were holding China back, and that it was in China’s interest that it divest itself of the ‘backward’ peripheries which the Qing had appended to it, and allow them to go off on their own, less important historical trajectories. But in the end, the perspective that won out was that of Liang Qichao, who advocated for the creation a sort of ‘national empire’, with a broader ‘Chinese’ nation encompassing more than just the Han. Sun Yat-Sen, who was in many ways a rival to Liang, nevertheless concurred on that basic premise, and in 1905 promulgated the idea that a future China would consist of ‘Five Races Under One Union’ – the Han, Manchus, Mongols, Tibetans, and Muslims, exactly the groups that the Qianlong Emperor had delineated back in the 18th century. The extent to which this rhetoric actually appealed to non-Han peoples in the Qing Empire was questionable at best, but it was also in some sense not relevant – this rhetoric did not exist to appeal to non-Han peoples as an argument for staying within a post-Qing imperial formation, but rather to justify this continuation for <em>Han</em> audiences.</p>

<p>—– <strong>886.2</strong> —–2022-10-19 22:39:08+08:00:</p>

<p>At this juncture it is also worth noting that ‘Han’ as an ethnic category may be extremely broad, but that doesn’t necessarily diminish its coherence. Rather, one can be Han <em>and also</em> hold a regional sub-identity within that. Indeed, it is worth stressing that a <em>huge</em> portion of the late Qing agitators, Constitutionalist and Republican alike, were Cantonese. Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Sun Yat-Sen, Wang Jingwei, and Huang Xing were all from Guangdong, and indeed Sun himself was partly Hakka, a minority group within the Guangdong context. Other notable agitators and revolutionaries were from other regions with non-Mandarin vernaculars: Li Zongren was from Guangxi, Zhang Binglin was from Zhejiang, and so too was Chiang Kai-Shek. If we go even further back, Hakkas made up the bulk of the early leadership of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which nevertheless positioned itself as a broadly pro-Han movement. Speaking minority languages other than the <em>lingua franca</em> of Mandarin was not considered contradictory with the idea of holding to a broader Han identity. Overt separatism by any of these linguistic minorities was not a particular feature of the late Qing, and its popularity in alternate histories and popular discourse seems to emerge from a misunderstanding of the nature of Han ethnic identity, as well as quite possibly a misapprehension about the nature of separatist and localist movements in Hong Kong in recent years.</p>

<p>When the revolution took place in 1911, Tibet declared its independence, but so too did Mongolia. These two had not actually had long histories of ethnic separatism within the Qing, but late Qing policy had led both to perceive that the Qing rhetoric of universalism was increasingly questionable in light of Han consolidations of power. Tibet no longer saw itself as the preceptor to the Qing’s donor, voluntarily offering spiritual authority to the empire, but instead as the subject of a fundamentally ‘Chinese’ state with consolidatory ambitions. Mongolia witnessed large-scale Han colonisation during the New Policy period after 1901, and indeed only Outer Mongolia succeeded in detaching itself from Chinese rule, while the much more colonised Inner Mongolia would fall within the grasp of the ROC. Han colonisation also serves in part to explain why the other two major ethnic constituents failed to put together a successful bid for independence: Manchuria was by this stage firmly majority-Han, and while Xinjiang was still only minority-Han, that Han minority had been entrusted with military power to keep the local Turkic Muslim population – which had intermittently risen in revolt since the early 1820s – ‘in line’. That is not to say that neither region had local independence movements: Japan quite actively tried to sponsor some Manchurian movements, culminating in the establishment of Manchukuo (albeit mainly via Japanese arms rather than local sentiment) in 1931; Xinjiang’s local independence movements came into their own in the 1930s and 1940s. Neither region managed to secure independence on a permanent basis, thanks to the consolidation of political and military power first by the KMT and latterly the CCP during the Second Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War, respectively. While Outer Mongolia (then a Soviet satellite state) remained beyond Chinese ambitions, irredentism would lead the PRC to invade and ‘reconquer’ Tibet in 1951, putting an end to four decades of post-Qing independence.</p>

<p>As for other ethnic groups, there is no single reason why a more concerted move towards independence did not take place, but an argument can be made for the principal factor being their lack of discrete overarching identities, and thus any ability or intent to organise themselves as a group towards achieving some kind of independent statehood. There simply wasn’t a political institution or even just a broad group consciousness uniting, say, the Miao, the Zhuang, or the Solons into a coherent force that might successfully press for freedom from impending Han Chinese rule. That said, study of these minority groups in general is quite sparse, and especially so in relation to the late Qing and revolutionary periods, so we may gain better insight in future. Nevertheless, we are unlikely to find anything that would radically disrupt the idea that ethnic groups outside the ‘big five’ simply lacked the means or the motive (or both) to establish independent state entities.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that ‘Hui’ is not a term with a fixed meaning. Originally, in official parlance it was used to refer to Turkic Muslim communities, latterly to all Muslims, and today it refers specifically to an ethnic group that is broadly Sinophone Muslim. It is also worth noting that ‘Hui’ derives etymologically from ‘Uighur’, and so it is not actually self-evident that the Yunnanese Hui <em>did</em> abandon their identity, as opposed to there being a divergence between how that identity was conceived among Yunnanese Muslims, versus Muslims in northwest China and in Turkestan.</p>

<p>一开始是按规则制度上位，然后利用制度把自己心腹换上去，换上去后用名义上合理的事是清除异己（反腐）</p>

<p>没有反对者，就用各种说辞去推广政治观念，等所有人回过味了，反抗已经很难有起色，开始出现巨大的成本。</p>

<p>然后人人都碍于成本过高，不清楚他人怎么想，没人有能力，或者敢于掀桌子，内部就只能达成一种一致性的沉默。</p>

<p>这样，那些践踏公序良俗的权力，也就在沉默之上建立了基础。</p>

<p>但这般的统治也是脆弱的，若用于维持暴力统治的机器运转不灵，一旦寒蝉效应失效，有人敢跳出来大喊打倒齐奥塞斯库，基于大众恐惧和沉默的权力自然也就不过是一纸空谈。</p>

<p>中共高层和许多红贵族对未来情况有非常清醒的认知，尤其是经济层面，发展经济在不政治改革放权的前提下，基本触及上限。</p>

<p>而政府的职能衰败和腐化问题无法消减，财政危机隐约浮现，有效解决根本的办法，都会引发政权危机。</p>

<p>因此内部在经过斗争后，无论是被打服还是确实同意，都需要习近平作为核心领袖来维护集体利益，形成一个内部稳定才好一致对外。</p>

<p>他们并不是不能认识到这些问题，以及这些问题的最终影响，而是不打算改善问题，下决心要通过牺牲中国过去几十年改革开放的成果，以及未来几十年到一个世纪中国国运，来尽可能地延长政权寿命。</p>

<p>10到20年，超出20年也是可能的，但过了这个范围，就处于随时暴毙，人人都有心和余地反，没啥讨论价值。</p>

<p>目前财政上与民争利，又不承担公共需求的不粘锅做法，包括后面的税改，应该至少可以把财政以现在这个状态续多五到七年很安稳，十年内没意外是不会有阶段性变化的。</p>

<p>但是国民可以很明确的感受到中共的施压加强，民间喘息空间越来越少。</p>

<p>类似问题其实说过很多，如果我们不考虑政变这种根本没法预测的东西，只从现有可追查的数据上去看。</p>

<p>中共财政目前是明显处于一个危机前兆的状态，这也是他们做很多财务改革的原因。</p>

<p>如果不掠夺改开财富，他们的财政最多持续八到十年，但是现实不是玩游戏凑够100经验就升级。</p>

<p>可能这面中央财政没崩，地方就财政反而崩了，然后出维稳漏洞，再加上突发事件形成连锁反应。</p>

<p>也就是说，不用财政完全见底，只需要到一定程度，就可能被连锁式的社运点爆。</p>

<p>起码现在政府什么都不做，未来十年会有相当大的一轮政府破产潮，政府破产=地方维稳失控。</p>

<p>不过财政做改革，可能会很大延长中央政府寿命，地方政府略微延长。</p>

<p>其实从现在越来越多人讨论中共剩余持续时间，人心思变的浪潮也愈发明显，我想相当多人都隐约感觉到中共执政已经进入末期的分水岭。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1775.2</strong> —–2022-10-18 03:59:04+08:00:</p>

<p>直接看每年的全国性公共支出里债务付息的增速比例。</p>

<p>先看之前的债务付息比例。</p>

<p>2007年债务付息993.45亿元</p>

<p>2008年债务付息1235.66亿元，增长24.4%</p>

<p>2010年的利息预算1512.36亿元，增速14.5%</p>

<p>2011年的利息预算1839.84亿元，增速21.7%</p>

<p>2012年全国付息决算是2635亿，2018年则飙升到了7400亿，翻了2.8倍，将近三倍，前后只用了6年时间，中途有抑制过，否则更高。</p>

<p>这里引入一下地方财政开支和收入中债务利息的比例（实际也包括中央，地方一般接收转移支付且整体数据中央占比小，可以大致理解为地方是数据主体来对比）</p>

<p>然后反过来我们看三组数据：</p>

<p>2016年地方总开支160437亿，全国债务付息4991亿，占比3.11%。</p>

<p>2021年地方总开支211272亿，全国债务付息10456亿，占比4.94%。</p>

<p>2022年1-8月，地方总开支144014亿，全国债务付息7532亿，占比5.23%。</p>

<p>再看三组数据：</p>

<p>2016年地方总收入87195亿，全国债务付息4991亿，占比5.7%。</p>

<p>2021年地方总收入111077亿，全国债务付息10456亿，占比9.41%。</p>

<p>2022年1-8月地方总收入74427亿，全国债务付息占比7532亿，10.12%。</p>

<p>地方有大量政府是长期大幅度赤字运行，要依赖中央的转移支付，否则立刻崩盘，但问题在于，中央政府的转移支付，本质是征收地方的资金自行安排，不是财政部从虚空里掏出来的，是有限的。</p>

<p>而且可以看得出，债务付息占比，无论是开支占比还是收入占比，都在不断提高。</p>

<p>跟其他赤字开销提高本地经济、就业和维稳等支出不同，债务付息是无效开支，债务是高赤字下维持当下社会体制运行的根本，又不能停下。</p>

<p>当无效开支占比越来越高时，实际等于政府有一部分固定开支在不断增长，侵蚀政府财政安全，政府也是要还月供的，区别是这个月供会越来越高。</p>

<p>2021年1-8月债务付息是7028亿，到2022年同期是7532亿，增幅7.2%。</p>

<p>去年全年增幅是6.6%，今年可能在11135亿左右。</p>

<p>而去年的2021年，是债务付息首次突破1万亿大关，如果看全国好像是九牛一毛，但对地方来讲，无论收入还是赤字开支，都已经是个不小的数字。</p>

<p>假设每年增幅是6.5%，我算的不准但也推下，2023年可能是11858亿，2024年12628，2025年13448亿，2026年14322亿，2027年15252亿，2028年16243，2029年17298亿，2030年18422亿，2031年19619亿，2032年20894亿。</p>

<p>也就是说十年后，保守估计最少都要约2.1万亿的固定开支。</p>

<p>但是更多可能是12%到15%的动态增速。</p>

<p>基于今年可能的11135亿，推算下12%和15%两种情况，到10年后2032年的开支规模。</p>

<p>12%应该是34583亿，15%则应是45047亿，但是全国财政收入增长，根本追不上这个缺口，虽然明显不可能年均12%到15%的进行增长，可即便6.5%的增速，大多数时候也可以追平全国财政增长了。</p>

<p>然后在这个基础上，地方政府维稳和清零的额外开销又是一笔钱，社会是越来越动荡的，维稳开销的增长是没上限的（不单纯是控制社会，还有部分用于补贴不同阶层或产业）</p>

<p>而利息开销不讲情面，只会不断上涨，甚至维稳开销也要依赖债务，而不单纯是靠转移支付才能达到维稳目标。</p>

<p>然后我们知道，分税制下，地方是一个个独立城市形成的集体，不是一个完整的个体。</p>

<p>所谓地方，有的城市可能公务员开销都给不起，有的城市能一年十几万养闲人。</p>

<p>经济危机和产业升级不顺畅，包括房地产市场萎靡，最先影响的就是这些有钱的大城市。到时候就会出现许多地方都有破产风险。</p>

<p>过去中央抽钱做转移支付救边缘小城市，那么这时候只能专注大城市，避免出现这些地区的动荡。</p>

<p>那小城市怎么办？这个时候事实上可能官方就只靠军队威慑来形成对这种小地方的控制。</p>

<p>外包似地把当地管治权交给地方门阀和一些本地灰色集团。</p>

<p>文字资料上，有一个《从债务付息，看地方财政压力》上的做了不少陈述，有兴趣可以看看，不过我一般是直接看官方的财政部数据，因为问题一直都有，大家都意识到了，具体粗略看财政部数据就能读大方向。</p>

<p>官方实际最近一直在收紧获取利益的渠道，过去可能民六官四，现在逐渐缩到民四官六，未来民三官七也是可能的，而且我觉得他们最终目标是民二官八，通过国家资本主义，让所有人生产和消费最终利益都以高度提纯的形势被他们获取。</p>

<p>而运营风险则由劳动者与企业自行承担，你倒了就换个企业当白手套，发展卷到死的社会就业风气，让劳动者无所选择。（再用房贷控制）</p>

<p>利息增速是稳定的，但是财政增速不是。每个地方政府都可以大规模举债，但是不是每个地方政府都能稳定赚钱，到后面会出现你有权，也没有赚钱变现去堵窟窿的渠道，这也是许多小地方政府会遭遇破产潮的原因。（多少一到三线城市病态依赖土地财政，有数据，这里太长我不赘述了。）</p>

<p>国内对政府破产换了个说法，叫财政重整，政治意味大于实际，避免动摇信心。六年前提出这个说法时，就说明中央政府高层是极其清楚未来要发生什么的，但很多人没明白他们知道什么，搞不清这点，信息差下就无法理解中共政府这几年的各种操作，实际人家危机感早就爆棚还做多手准备了。</p>

<p>鹤岗现在破产，之后会有大量的县和十八线城市接连破产，中共的财政安排和敛财手段，可能会拖延破产潮的到来，但不会改变。（羊毛出在羊身上，拖越久，全国人民越像葛优，不是党国不愿意换一个，而是没有其他羊了）</p>

<p>如果加速，十年内看到也不是没可能，至少目前一切恶化状况都比我前几年预测来的要快很多。破产潮什么时候来不清楚，但二十年内百分百出现，我们可能已经在破产潮带来的一个历史拐点里，只是现在还没意识到，后知后觉，在未来历史教科书上可能才会反应过来，恍然大悟原来这个时候中共就已经不行了。</p>

<p>宣传上其实有，这个我可能也不是特别擅长吧，所以一直是希望有人感兴趣，可以用自己所擅长的方式简要后推广，人都是孤立的，能力有限，不是全能，所以才需发展集体。</p>

<p>专业上我没能力给建议，润不润，关键看你对自己未来定位，能爬的高肯定不是坏事，因为意味着有更多资源，但我不清楚会不会说出去历练出其他意外，所以这个我没法帮你下决定，一定要看你自己。</p>

<p>整体来说，未来国内环境肯定收紧，但完全朝鲜化的可能性不大，因为成本太高，这种议题一旦在社会里被讨论起来，民众与政府就会逐渐走向完全对立</p>

<p>但即便不是完全朝鲜化，现在这个氛围很多人也受不了，所以出去是个不算差的选项。</p>

<p>如果说未来可能会想参与到国内动荡时期的一些事情，目前的路有两条，一是在外部配置资产，自己人在国内，只要允许肉身离开，随时都可以走，或者内部出事了，自己也能在第一线随时观察局势而动，不过这种方案成本很高。</p>

<p>二是润到国外发展，如果可以在外累积一定资源，当未来国内动荡，条件允许下可以选择回国。</p>

<p>如果不想参与未来国内局势，只是求安身立命，国内完全没留念，润了是不错的选择，但必须考虑清楚润出去以后阶级可能下滑，学历认受性可能较差，年纪大没有孩子适应性强的问题，尤其是你自己花钱的收益是否达到了你想要的。</p>

<p>总的来说除非历练的收益非常不明确或者很少，个人还是社会层面，都不建议真正意义上躺平，现在提前预判问题做的努力，都是为未来危机出现后，有更多退路和解决方案做预案。</p>

<p>债务分两个阶段，第一个是李鹏时期就在乱搞的结果，那个更夸张，增长率我有提到，结果是许多银行和企业坏账，到两千年才算解决，大下岗是其中一个体现。</p>

<p>第二阶段就是土地财政驱动的激进基建建设，也即是凯恩斯主义，因为一定程度上是背靠土地财政快速增长的收入，中国也的确需要庞大的基建，文革基建都太老了。</p>

<p>所以前几个阶段是可以的，但是到“四万亿”时期就有点用力过猛，市场的消费总量对应实际远超四万亿的规模不对称，却对政府来说是个可以保证经济增长的手段。</p>

<p>随后就成为一种常态，变成经济吗啡了。</p>

<p>不这么做，党国的选项就是结束分税制。</p>

<p>因为中央收缴财权，地方没钱不能办事，官方不能拉动经济，别说经济，行政都无法展开，最后就变成地方全是维稳窟窿。</p>

<p>其实这就是没有选择的选择，要么结束分税制，回到赵紫阳改革的老路，要么分税制下，用土地财政和债务带动经济的模式，看看能续命到什么时候。</p>

<p>赵紫阳因为早就预判到了这种结局，所以政府大开销的方案都是谨慎保守的，并且提出公平社会的需求，实际是转型内需消费。（我不确定赵紫阳有没有内需消费社会的这个具体概念，但赵紫阳在1987年政府工作报告里是明确有提到消费结构问题）</p>

<p>但是保守派的目标就是给自己政权续命，也就无所谓问题不问题，只是中国经济快速增长，土地足够多，人口盘子够大，能在某个时期承受住政府这种寅吃卯粮的做法。</p>

<p>中共现在如果抛弃一切历史包袱转向，既然是假设性问题我不谈人事变动或者没法预测的政变什么的。</p>

<p>转型其实很简单，就是回到赵紫阳的路上，因为赵紫阳时期，已经把经济发展、政治发展的路线做了非常详细的规划和分阶段步骤。</p>

<p>首先就是必须党国自己从上往下放权，赵紫阳谈改革就很简单嘛，就是分权。</p>

<p>经济分权有改革开放，政治分权匹配进行，一下就放，那肯定是要死的，这么多人都等着反对你呢，肯定不能一下子就放，文革平反后，国内政治向心力那么强，赵紫阳都认为不能一下子放到底。</p>

<p>基本要执行的，就是先党内，后党外，先高层内部扩权分权，矛盾公开化建制化，权力交接在党内明确机制。</p>

<p>这些东西要做出来，需要的其实不是经济上有财政背书，而是政治上有合法性背书。</p>

<p>现在的确财政危机日渐凸显，但政府最缺乏的是施政的安全空间。</p>

<p>中国不是个福利国家，长期以往其实公共福利政策变迁对民意的影响不大，也就是说他们转型要面对一个前提，他们合法性的获取来源。</p>

<p>名义上说是经济增长，实际这个问题不深究的普通人可能不明白，但对六四有深入了解的，应该清楚合法性是来自于暴力。</p>

<p>这是他们转型非常困难的一个根本原因，也是为什么如果一个新政权上台，施政改革空间会远比他们要大，而不会更小（但财政上新政权肯定是更小的）</p>

<p>党国需要的是政治上的可操作性，而不优先是经济上的可操作性。如果建立在一个一放就全是反对者，而没有中间温和过渡群体的社会，那无论怎么操作都不可能有转型机会，也就是我常提到的，人们只要有不满意，想的不是表达意见，而是杀光你们这群当官的。</p>

<p>如果民众的政治立场，天然已经到了这种程度，政权下台是时间问题，改革也只会失败。</p>

<p>所以培育一个中间群体，温和地去跟民众交流，把这个中间群体作为施政的方向标，逐渐为本没有的政治转型空间，一点点争取到，这一点对当下如果想改革的政府是非常有意义的。</p>

<p>这样一个中间群体，原本是扮演一个沟通角色，也适当起到对政府问责，群众可以通过这个群体来表达意见和不满，从而降低基层与政府改革无法沟通带来的摩擦和暴力冲突。</p>

<p>过去这个群体国内叫“公共知识分子”，或者一些新媒体，但政府自己亲手抹杀这些中间群体，获得了国内社会全部政治生态的话语权，也导致自己改无可改，只要出事就会变成众矢之的。</p>

<p>一开始是允许学者在大学说自己观点，可能原本100%限制，现在80%，然后60%，不同领域和学校，根据时间一点点降下来。</p>

<p>成立一个相关部门，类似当年农研室，跟青年学者多交流沟通，党外说话可能还要维持100到90%的舆论管控，当时内部交流可以放到50%或者干脆不设防。</p>

<p>当内部讨论的风气渐渐稳定，再从党内高层一点点开始这方面的人才选拔，让这些青年能更多参与第一线政务，了解地方情况，不能太着急，可以给地方官僚配一些学者去互相了解。</p>

<p>一是基层官僚涉及政治立场不深，能更好吸收学术观点，二是基层是大多数人才会遇到的，三是可以让青年学者也有行政历练，不至于纸上谈兵。</p>

<p>跟着，就当下情况来说，初步允许一些学者开始公开讲话是比较好的，尤其是对言论审核上，比如罗翔这样的学者，让学者之间能辩论，相当于对社会不同发展的政策，在非政治领域的学术端，开了一个头。</p>

<p>这样就完成了从内部学术端，到行政端，再到社会大众层面，一点点放开。</p>

<p>只有这样下，政府才能从一个消灭言论自由的独裁政权，慢慢通过基层行政，以及政府为青年学者背书的行为，重新收获民众信任。</p>

<p>比如说温铁军吧，国内现政权推他当网红学者，那我要是做政治改革，就拉陆铭出来跟他打擂台，党内肯定有人支持温铁军的路线，那党内这种矛盾就要私下公开化提出，不能完全幕后操作，但也不会太早对外公开。</p>

<p>当两个成熟的派系出现后，再通过党内明面机制约束起来，也就是说行政端出现新发展起来的改革派，还有保守势力。</p>

<p>双方在民间舆论的斗争，毫无意外必然以改革派获胜告终，因为所谓改革就是建立在革掉保守派别的基础上，一旦话匣子打开允许讨论，辩论本身就会产生一个结果。</p>

<p>这也是为什么基层的行政端年轻人，要了解学术观点。而有改革精神的学术端年轻人，也必须要了解真实行政工作才行，这样理论和实际结合，在行政、党务、学术和民众舆论上，变成一个旧政府自己扶持起来的派系。</p>

<p>表面看是自己打自己，实际是左右手换手，最后目的是什么？是在不更替政权的前提下，重拾民众对政府的信任，把政治改革的缓冲区扩大，不再是一放就死的矛盾局面。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1775.7</strong> —–2022-10-21 20:20:09+08:00:</p>

<p>华国锋下台是个自然而然的过程，一开始邓是完全劣势的，但也不是说谁注定要斗谁，陈云这些其实也没之前强势，本身邓的复出，华国锋也有参与找他来恢复工作的。</p>

<p>大家双方实际矛盾没那么大，但是后来慢慢在具体怎么改革这件事上，分歧越来越大，尤其是两个凡是，这一点决定双方迟早会有政治矛盾，两个凡是是华国锋背靠的政治地位来源，就跟蒋介石需要沿海地区商人地主支持一样。</p>

<p>华国锋的洋跃进出问题，政治而经济的路线到79年是彻底失败，这个时候他在党内一无人事优势二无根基。</p>

<p>既然大家是集体工作，肯定会有人反对，而华国锋想搞毛那套，是没有办法推行，这也是他政治上的需求。</p>

<p>然后从务实角度来讲，真理大讨论也不是单纯为了华国锋，而是包括毛一整套的政治生态遗产发起攻击，目的就是打倒两个凡是，那么背靠毛政治遗产的华国锋，自然更站不住了。</p>

<p>相当等于华国锋站在名为毛泽东思想的大厦上，我现在用真理大辩论，从底层开始讨论，华国锋如果想反对，说到底层验证，你起码得有更下层的人事权和人脉吧，你没有的话，怎么验证和抓稳基层舆论。</p>

<p>然后说下我自己个人观点。</p>

<p>人事权上，胡耀邦当时负责党校，是副校长，中组部部长郭玉峰都没法控制他在舆论上的宣传攻势，后来胡耀邦也当上中组部。</p>

<p>事实上控制整个中共的人事权、宣传工作，另一方面也反应，毛泽东作为党内权威死后，能比得上的大部分不是文革被整死就是同年一起死了。</p>

<p>同时怀仁堂事变，四人帮这样毛扶持起来控制部分人事的团体也被搞垮，直接导致过去通过毛内朝“四人帮”联系在一起的官僚（包括许多造反派），还有一直被毛整的国务院或其他行政官僚，都处于一个群龙无首状态。（周也死了）</p>

<p>整这些官僚的毛泽东人也没了，继承毛核心思想的四人帮没了，四人帮下线的那群人也懵了，华国锋作为推翻四人帮的核心，实际是两面的人事权都没继承下来。</p>

<p>而华国锋也没办法在这种碎片化下，快速建立人事权，因为党内邓陈是有人脉的，所以邓一开始姿态非常低，就差无条件拥护伟大正确的华主席了。</p>

<p>然后这个时候国内出两个方向，一是毛和四人帮这些核心毛思想的人物都没了，人们开始寻求经济和政治上的变化，二是胡赵万这几个关键人物，开始在地方上发力。</p>

<p>万里最先冒出来，他是比较莽的，敢做。然后是赵紫阳谨慎小心把地方经济试验做成，成为邓能在中央挺起腰杆的两大支撑之一。</p>

<p>另外一个就是真理大讨论，这一点也是包括到经济层面的，核心就是不做不知道。</p>

<p>那为什么以前不做呢？大家都知道，因为毛不让。毛当时死了但威信还是很高，所以大背景下，经济改革不能直接否定，现在毛死了，就试一试看看呗。这样经济和政治才能相辅相成。</p>

<p>当然，政治上是以真理大讨论为主体进行的，因为经济政策是包括在其中，更多是政治上认同毛也会犯错，然后通过平反这种大部分人都有的客观需求，再反过来建立毛的错误是实打实的，既然毛政治上也会有错误，那经济上的测试就更无不可了。</p>

<p>这样就不存在令行禁止的环境，而华国锋洋跃进不怎么样，人事权也没有，经济政治一个都管不住。</p>

<p>所以真理大讨论虽然是基于华国锋的两个凡是，但主要攻击的是毛泽东思想。</p>

<p>改革开放，改的就是毛的制度。华国锋上来本无根基，工作也需要邓在内的许多人手，结果被酝酿一下，下台就无可避免了。</p>

<p>如果现在搞党内真理大讨论，首先没人给背书，其次刚发出来，习近平就有能力通过人事权直接找暴力机关抓人了，华国锋没这个能力，这是当时的一个重要背景。</p>

<p>华国锋下台也是渐进的，一直到八十年代早期才彻底推出权力核心，78年是开始，79-80年是分水岭，党内和公职逐一交出，权力是一点点下滑的，但我想78年时他已经意识到不可能站得住，后面交权也很顺利，并不是很多人印象里，华国锋一下就被排挤出去了。</p>

<p>主要开始失势是78年末的十一届三中全会，真理大讨论后，党内已经有基础，各自站队选好边，一拿出来公开表态，华国锋就没余地了。</p>

<p>结果是被迫交出政府权力，总理被交给了赵紫阳，胡赵也进入常委，邓势力这时候已经完全占上风。</p>

<p>到80年时，实际掌权的应该是胡耀邦的中央书记处，再往后就是打落水狗了，拆头衔来获取名正言顺的行政权大体上从78年开始，持续到81年。</p>

<p>逻辑上有三种可能</p>

<p>第一种，不结束是作为长期基本政策执行，沉没效应前期投入的政治和舆论成本太高，所以才有必要执行成永久性政策。</p>

<p>第二种，在寻找一个可以结束的平衡点，撑不住就结束，但能撑住就不会停，这个平衡需要逐渐拉平前期的政治宣传和投入，才能为未来逐渐放缓做铺垫，以达成实质性结束，最后过渡到公开结束。</p>

<p>第三种，官方打算有序结束这种清零政策，但二十大前后没台阶下，有台阶就会下来。</p>

<p>因为二十大导致的信息迷雾很多，二十大结束后实际是清零停止的最佳窗口期，如果二十大后半年到一年清零仍然不结束，且经济下滑下坚持清零，那很有可能是第一种。</p>

<p>或者说第二种，但官方想试验社会在极度控制下，经济下滑能支撑到什么地步，为未来的全面管控做累积。（不过我倾向于他们除了少数长期政策，大部分都是基于长期政策的倾向，走一步看一步。）</p>

<p>—– <strong>1775.9</strong> —–2022-10-22 22:32:53+08:00:</p>

<p>我们普通人眼里看是这样，他们看完还这样只有两个可能：</p>

<p>第一，政治因素导致他们不能随便转向，折腾全国导致问题一点点出现，比放弃一个立的过高的政治口号，导致人心尽失的损失小。</p>

<p>第二，他们也是走一步看一步，有危机感但是政权本身是基于不妥协于社会需求的基础上建立的，自然不会第一时间在手段用尽前，考虑会不会因为这种问题被拖垮，而是在集中资源去压制问题。</p>

<p>显然第一点是客观存在的，习近平为核心的政府，宣传两年多的防疫路线，封城导致一系列巨大问题。</p>

<p>如果现在突然放弃，或者说二十大前后时间内放弃，政治上都是非常打脸的事，就跟乌克兰中方嘲讽美方情报，或者佩洛西访台一样。</p>

<p>宣传过多，结果事与愿违，对政权威信的打击是非常大的。</p>

<p>专家我可能谈不上，只是感兴趣多了解一些。</p>

<p>清零目前是可以维持下去的，主要是持续多久，当下是全国赤字，好像除了上海都需要赤字运行。</p>

<p>我不清楚这个赤字是收入下降带来的，还是支出扩张带来的，不过显而易见清零政策下，两者完全会同时发生。</p>

<p>尤其是清零有大量不进行生产，并且妨碍生产的无效行政动作。</p>

<p>这就造成让人无法生产赚钱去消费和纳税，政府需要扩张财政支持政治清零。</p>

<p>地方一般债还债 1.55万亿</p>

<p>地方专项债还债 1.15万亿</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>现在发行期限，一般债是平均8年左右，专项债务是平均15年到13年</p>

<p>也就是说，虽然这么粗暴算不科学，但中共财政至少有两个坎要过去，一个是十年后，最近几年债务增速和、利息增长和公共开销超额的部分，加上疫情带来的过量增长。</p>

<p>中共目前已经做了应对手段，改税制是其中一个目前已经具体的，尤其是直接税体制建立。</p>

<p>然后第二轮的专项债，在2035到2037年有一轮还债潮，我不认为到时候政府财政还能从各种危机下完好无损保护每个环节，无论大小，一定会出现漏洞。</p>

<p>而且中途不断增长的债务利息，会跟维稳经费之间竞争有限的财政增长。</p>

<p>因为是平均的年限，所以有的可能是20到30年的，有的是7-10年浮动，大体上每年都要还债，现在压力还不算大，但未来不好说。</p>

<p>债务限额，可以理解为官方对未来一段时间，能获取收益的控制范围。</p>

<p>但是这个东西说科学也科学，说不科学也不科学，因为遇到突发事件和刚需，地方只能靠发债来保证政治目标和执行政策，你不把债务配额推高，也解决不了问题。</p>

<p>所以不排除以后出现一个奇景，就是某省份一年只能给一万亿发债限额，地方政府把限额几乎用了，然后解决不了问题（这个情况应该已经出现了，有很多省份逼近吃满）</p>

<p>如果债务限额100%，使用率到90%或者110%，可能地方政府对社会控制都还好，可以拆东墙补西墙，欺负一些公务员。</p>

<p>可到了130%甚至150%，那离死不远了。（当然，纸面数据不可能反馈出来，只会出现债务限额暴增。）</p>

<p>当时许多元老还在，叶剑英有军队人脉，但是党内主张党指挥枪，政治上拿不到的，讲规矩也没法靠军事优势获得，而且叶剑英以外的人也有军队工作经验，他不可能掀桌子，邓的弱势是相对在桌子上的，你掀桌子他肯定也不讲规矩，军队人脉他们也有。</p>

<p>因为叶剑英实际是邓复出主推者之一，他本身并不去竞争最高领导人的这个身份，而且跟胡耀邦关系很好，后面看华国锋的政治路线可能不符合他预期，所以也开始转向。</p>

<p>因此华国锋被党内会议批评后，让华国锋认错的，是叶剑英说“周公辅成王“，以及把华国锋当”后主“，犯了错，那么这样可以看得出，他对自己定位就是个尽心竭力的辅佐人物，最后也算给华国锋台阶下了。</p>

<p>然后互相辞让最高领导人的职务，最后叶剑英和邓小平也坚决不接受，给了胡耀邦。</p>

<p>胡耀邦跟邓和叶剑英的关系都非常密切，所以这个人就很符合华、叶、邓的预期。</p>

<p>因为胡耀邦办事合理，华国锋没挨整也替他说公道话，尤其是平反上，华国锋只是把两个凡是当政治背书的遗产，本身对平反并没有说加以四人帮式的阻拦，只是”不积极不热情“，华国锋还多次找他出来主持工作，胡耀邦没答应，叶剑英找才肯出来。</p>

<p>他们实际矛盾没有想的那么大，都是工作同事，华国锋也是尊重老同志的，政治斗争可能算是建国以来恶性程度最低的，大家都能合理交流。</p>

<p>而叶剑英的自我批判上可以看出，他就没打算当最高领导人，去竞争也没意义。</p>

<p>再到后来有一个关键要素是身体实在不好，一线工作也没法负责了，加上老人都要退，自然也就退了。</p>

<p>但是他去世在一个很错误的节点，如果叶剑英在，我认为邓小平不会去动胡耀邦。</p>

<p>华国锋人其实也不错，就是时代背景上来讲是政治选错了路线，可惜了。</p>

<p>胡下台其实很多事都是连锁的，陆铿对胡的采访，也是胡被逼宫批斗的一个主要原因，身体状态开始直线下滑，叶剑英在，借陆铿采访批斗可能没那么厉害。</p>

<p>如果说邓小平是改革派的靠山，胡赵是改革派的前台骨干，邓力群胡乔木就是保守派的前台骨干，党内跟胡赵对立，背后是王震陈云这些人，一度想竞争总书记职位，是党内保守派一线政治斗争的主要负责人。</p>

<p>无论国民党还是中共，再到北洋军阀，都多次从日本、沙俄、苏联都无一例外等地缘势力间摇摆，清因战争失败被迫割地赔款，但其让渡领土极少，本也无对等经济地位，反而促成了洋务运动，主权地位仍在。</p>

<p>北洋政府分崩离析算是比较靠近其描述的，但北洋政府只存在十几年，并且是基于反封建和开化运动，各类新文化和技术革命才是主流。到国民政府时期，背后支持者也从早期日本转向苏联，并且后来很快跟左翼决裂，苏联再无法直接染指，最接近的中共，本土派也最终取胜。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1780.1</strong> —–2022-10-21 17:11:12+08:00:</p>

<p>中共攻台的意愿近年来越来越明显</p>

<p>如果不是突然发难（12个月之内），那么攻台的第一个窗口期在2024年到2025年，第二个窗口期是2027年前后。</p>

<p>2024-25年时期乌克兰战争可能已结束或者进入阶段性停火，美国正在进行政权轮换。</p>

<p>二十大上习近平还特地强调了“实现建军一百年奋斗目标，开创国防和军队现代化新局面”，川普不排除卷土重来，如果当选不干涉台湾事务的可能性很大。</p>

<p>2027年前后，第三任期接近尾声，如果习近平身体没特别大问题，脑袋清醒想做第四任期，从政权需求还是倒行逆施对社会造成的问题，都需要一个转移压力的出口。</p>

<p>我觉得不大可能只打金门，因为会打草惊蛇，导致台湾和海外有时间反应。</p>

<p>最大问题其实不来自于大陆方面，而是我看不到台湾有特别积极的进行备战，除非中共出现跟乌克兰一样的拉跨情况，否则台湾军队唯一的作用就是拖延时间，以此争取附近地区盟友反应。</p>

<p>中共的各种讲话所描述的作战需求，虽然没指名道姓，但都知道是说台湾战争，只是一直解释为局部战争。</p>

<p>这意味中共的方案有两种，一是在美国反应过来前就决定台湾战争的走向。二是赌美国在被小程度攻击后，不会冒险介入台湾战争（拦截冲绳基地靠近台湾海域的军队）</p>

<p>但台湾方面我看了很多新闻，官方的一些人给我的感觉是“如果花那么多钱去发展军队，要是中共不来不就浪费了”的逻辑。</p>

<p>从现在开始最少每年按GDP增长0.2%，2025前达到3%最好，现役兵力应在至少30万，理想值在45-50万，因为台湾纵深太小，一切都是看速度，预备役再多也根本没时间动员，也不具备地理空间给你动员，可能你一半预备役在台北，还没等动员，人家军队登陆了。</p>

<p>现役力量就是台湾陆地战争能撑多久的一个指标（前提是建制没被打崩溃，台湾士兵真的有乌克兰人一样的抵抗意志的话）</p>

<p>对台湾来说，最优解其实就是以拖代打，政治上拖延示好，阳奉阴违，军事上想尽办法拖延和增加杀伤比例。防御要么是阻断大陆投送到台湾的船舰，要么是大陆投送人力的速度，跟不上损耗速度。</p>

<p>因为投送人力后攻坚要一定人数和物资指标，部署也需要人手展开，否则就是无组织的添油战术。</p>

<p>第一批登岛的肯定都是专门训练出来的精锐，你能一直靠陆战杀伤影响造成减员，能打断对方计划，还能有效降低作战难度，但在我看来客观环境不是最大问题，最大问题是台湾本身的态度好像不太当回事。</p>

<p>标志不够鲜明，现代互联网信息太发达，习仲勋开明，但改革抓重点对比胡赵是从征，他缺乏足够全面的政经影响力，文革结束后一线行政工作少，主要还集中在广东，而且没几年。</p>

<p>如果以后广东和深圳全面开倒车，到是可以用来当靶子批判习近平砸习仲勋的建设，否则按体制内和公论来讲，虽然我们都知道经济特区和后来自贸区不是一个东西，但反过来讲习近平任内推动无论谁主推都好，一些自贸区比如海南这样的，反而是名义上跟当初接近，不太好下嘴。</p>

<p>再往后习仲勋主要在书记处和人大工作，找不到足够用来贴切大众生活水平，又与当代政治问题相关的话题，或者说能找到但立不起靶子。</p>

<p>再有就是靶子立的高没有用，对方不接话茬，视而不见就影响不了。</p>

<p>不像胡赵，胡赵的嫡系到现在还有非常多建在，他们实际的贡献也是明确的，影响太大了，海外一些做学术年纪大的反贼，不是赵紫阳选的，就是跟赵紫阳和胡耀邦有关联，魏京生当初邓小平想整死他，胡耀邦给救了。程晓农这样的是赵紫阳前下属，类似下属的就很多了，鲍彤还活着，李锐这样的胡赵一个战壕的也没走几年。</p>

<p>其实不是海外自由主义者特地捧谁，而是他们都有政治关联，海内外有年纪的反对者主要三个构成：</p>

<p>1.改革开放阶段胡赵典选的人才预备役，其中很多跑路到海外了，他们出了相当多的书。</p>

<p>2.六四前就在搞民运的人士，胡耀邦下台他们吃一轮挂落。</p>

<p>3.六四后跑路的人士，这批可能之前在民间，对胡有了解和认知，看赵跟看李鹏区别不大。</p>

<p>实际上缺乏的问题，主要是全职搞民运的人少，没法建立一个人物体系，要么过于学术，要么过于胡诌，还喜欢互相攻击，因为本身就没有闹革命这个实业，把改革破人物具体的政治化成图腾，让大众清晰认知这件事，也就没有一个体系存在。</p>

<p>那习仲勋自然扶不起来，文献肯定是有的，万里都认知的很少，现有的认知资源，其实只够胡赵用的，人大给万里做帮手的习仲勋更没空间了，这东西得有人认，六四后谈改革坚决不谈赵，这就是有人认，你冒领功劳人家一拿赵紫阳就戳你脊梁骨。</p>

<p>胡锦涛看这个样，身体已经不太行了，他出去有不少人都不太意外的样子，说明他身体不好高层是知道的，对胡锦涛离席大体在预料之内。</p>

<p>跟习近平和李克强交流也能看出关系远近。</p>

<p>习近平是回头点头，胡锦涛可能是嘱托什么，然后回头示意，就是老同志和习之间交流，有明显距离。</p>

<p>对李克强是拍肩膀，这是相对关系亲近的举动，李克强旁边看不清是不是汪洋，汪洋从头到尾脑袋都没转，要么是在看什么东西，要么是跟胡锦涛关系比较远或者不太好（十年前就有消息说胡锦涛干预了汪洋入常）</p>

<p>一开始习近平往李克强方向看了一眼，似乎还是在笑，看那个扭头可能对胡锦涛的情况早就预判到了，说话不扭头是不耐烦的迹象，比如家里有老人说要做一件事，一般我们可能会深点头一下劝他别这样做。</p>

<p>栗战书这面举动比较多，算是对老同志尊重了，王沪宁扯衣角和习的反应能看出党内威权是怎么构筑出来的。</p>

<p>王岐山旁边的不知道是不是温家宝，如果是，他跟汪洋是中央区域，唯二完全没扭头看胡锦涛的人。</p>

<p>宋平也没看，但宋平年纪太大了，他有没有注意到这件事都难说，不能当例证。</p>

<p>很难说团派内部没矛盾发生过，起码温家宝和汪洋的反应很不正常，另外也反应一件事，党内利益和私下可能有远近，但大体还是同志工作关系，虽然定于一尊，对内也有威权的体现（如果王沪宁拉扯栗战书是为了维护习近平权威的话），但主要是对中委会以外的中央部门和地方示意，政治局内的差距还没彻底拉开到毛时代，不过习可能已经对这些有点心不在焉了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.2</strong> —–2022-10-22 17:27:28+08:00:</p>

<p>团派这个描述现在被异化了，在早期被胡赵点名提拔，邓选定的接班体系都被泛称为团派，包括温家宝，只不过是以胡锦涛这样有共青团背景的人为核心去称呼，现在单独分拣出来，是后来逆推回去分类的做法，本末倒置了，所以温家宝独立派系的这个说法其实一直不准确。</p>

<p>因为六四后没有独立的改革派，只有改革派被邓改造后的“团派”，以技术官僚为主，许多资历年轻点的改革派都被划入这个群体，刚好共青团背景的人士居多，这也是为什么李瑞环这样有短期共青团履历的人不好分类，但他的老领导胡启立是肯定分在团派范畴的。</p>

<p>看样子的话，习近平还是对胡上心关注的，估计有没拍到的部分吧，要不然后面点头不至于用力，只是看他身体不好劝完了没啥好说的，就等胡自己离开了。</p>

<p>习之后任期重点就两个，扩张财政，从哪扩张不好说，但税改在路上，直接税是要来的。</p>

<p>其次是舆论继续收紧，文化和社会管控力度加大，想不到任何松的理由。</p>

<p>原因其实很简单，中共财政危机现在很明显，虽然距离出大麻烦可能还要十年左右，但官方已经在未雨绸缪，这方面他们预判和危机感还是非常强的，大众反而普遍在这点跟不上他们，然后经常好奇为什么官方有那么多弱智操作。</p>

<p>其实这些都有原因，一个是官僚主义和威权体系的权力来源所导致的普遍现象，另一个就是财政危机感，他们很清醒。</p>

<p>经济和政治层面会基于一个原则执行所有政策，那就是“不粘锅原则”。</p>

<p>也即是执行国家资本主义，政权在其中的利润最大化，风险企业承担，继续靠政策制造人为稀缺性，让民众以高价买单（别无他店，不买不行）</p>

<p>典型的比如一些文化产品，审核权一抓，你不去指定的平台或途径，你就没有中国市场，卡着你审核。</p>

<p>或者房地产已经开始的，出地价格不变，要求房企原价拿地，但降价出售，又不许房价下降，行政干预，相当于要求企业利润下降，但又不许让民众买跌价房子。</p>

<p>未来十年会越来越严，一些小地方政府可能陆续破产。</p>

<p>当然，官方不叫破产，叫财政重组，我相信未来肯定有一大堆二次发明的新名词。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.5</strong> —–2022-10-22 17:57:41+08:00:</p>

<p>我知道，所以才说是异化的，如果从内部关系来看，那人家关系和派系林立，说法就太多了，这种关系网划分不具备实际意义。</p>

<p>许多人后续描述的“团派”，是单纯以共青团背景人士执政后的一个政治分类，去剔除相关人士，这是从现在时间点逆推过去的一种描述，要搞清楚团派概念从哪来的，这是六四后慢慢诞生的概念，不是近年诞生的。</p>

<p>团派应是个以改革派为核心，被邓改造后的技术官僚群体，只是以共青团背景或相关人士为主体，用以区别另一技术官僚集团，所谓上海帮的江派。</p>

<p>老一代党员，尤其是赵紫阳谈胡温时是捆绑在一起的，温的相对独立也是在这个集体背景下的一部分，不是一个完全独立于团派的政治派别，很多人说的独立，是独立于胡锦涛。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.6</strong> —–2022-10-22 19:16:38+08:00:</p>

<p>六四之前没有团派，只有改革派，只是相当多人有共青团背景，之后改口叫团派，是因为主要就这个背景的人在政治清洗里被邓保留下来。</p>

<p>胡温是邓钦定的“团派”下一代两大核心角色，在未来职务上邓在死前已经明确了他们的长期发展，江在这条路线上，邓没死之前没有不同意的余地，邓死后才有李长春竞争总理的传闻，温此时已经蓄力准备接班了。</p>

<p>否则看人情往来，他们都是工作上的同事，人人互相都有关系，没法按照这种只有当事人之间知道的关系去划分。</p>

<p>所以我虽然同意团派已经是相对松散的一个派系集体，且温家宝与江的勾兑，但并不影响从他们政治出身的溯源，就像李瑞环是胡启立的人，但共青团背景来讲，他又履历很短，如果把他纳入团派，他也跟温家宝一样，是这个大体系下相对独立的，却不是一个完全独立的派别</p>

<p>因为如果一个人不从政治上背叛自己的源头，他的派系也不会发生根本上的变化。</p>

<p>有一个参考人物就是乔石，他是跟胡启立一样被看好提拔上来的干部，乔石在人际关系上跟陈云派系有不少关联，甚至以改革派身份出任中组部部长，对比下胡启立被陈云派系反感明显，但同是赵紫阳嫡系的田纪云又跟邓陈两家关系颇好。</p>

<p>两人都没有背叛自己的政治出身和立场，也是能被称作改革派的一个根本原因。</p>

<p>这也是为什么赵紫阳到两千年后，仍然把两人归于同一范畴，而朱镕基和李长春都是赵紫阳提拔的改革派，但大众视角不会把他们列入团派。</p>

<p>因为作为政治实体出现的团派技术官僚联盟，是胡锦涛时期的事，李长春大体上是放弃了自己的政治出身，所以很多久以前一度有传闻，说江泽民支持李长春出任总理。</p>

<p>朱镕基没有背叛自己的政治出身，政策路线上仍然是基于胡赵的政治遗产。</p>

<p>这一点到现在都可以看出差异，上海帮的所谓技术官僚，实际只是从改革派为主体的技术官僚，到红色子弟为领袖的贵族化中，用于过渡的一个历史派系。</p>

<p>他们既无明确理念，也无长远执政基础，而后诞生的团派，和前身改革派成员，无论改革思想多少，都基本秉持一个共同政治出身和目标为原则。</p>

<p>现在是明显可以看得出，比起红色子弟上台后的政治理念，团派的改革内核没变，只是六四后被改造的程度，导致赵紫阳所提及的改革思维多寡而已，被限制了表达，有政治理念的对抗，派别对立才明显，这也是为什么上海帮在这之间的形象模糊，产生了跟他们有关联的政治人物也容易被模糊化的原因。</p>

<p>胡允许温对外公开谈文革和政治改革，我想是他性格范围内允许的最大程度的支持，来自于胡赵的改革理念是维系这群人不变的一个政治宗旨，除非背叛，否则只有支持多少，以及具体怎么改的区别，跟上海帮的得过且过，以及太子党的开倒车有本质政治冲突。</p>

<p>我用团派是因为党内现在没有改革派这个团体。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.7</strong> —–2022-10-22 20:16:10+08:00:</p>

<p>这个描述没区别啊，我前一段才刚对人说过。</p>

<p>李鹏和姚依林影响温家宝仕途，也干预田纪云等人的入常的可能性。</p>

<p>邓安排胡温，铺垫入局，邓死后传出朱镕基支持温家宝，江泽民支持李长春的传闻，朱和胡温都是南巡后邓铺垫的，陈俊生还是赵紫阳的人，江上台无根基，邓死前只能按照邓的设计去执行。</p>

<p>当时改革重点仍然聚焦农村工作，加上书记处的身份，入常是必然的。</p>

<p>田纪云是赵嫡系，不能入常和升任总理，所以李鹏任期满了朱镕基这个角色刚好最适合解决李鹏的经济烂账，同时温家宝以兼任身份接手最重要的地方农村工作。</p>

<p>在我看来尉健行或李岚清其中一个人的常委身份或全部，原本应该属于温家宝，邓不让田纪云入常，推动朱镕基和温家宝是个很清晰的路线。</p>

<p>而李鹏又是邓从政治上不能撤下否定的一个角色。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.8</strong> —–2022-10-22 20:35:27+08:00:</p>

<p>另外书籍某些地方要选择性看，全盘接收很容易出问题，可以知道与真实情况有偏差，这也是为什么我提倡要多资料去结合，看信史的态度辩证。</p>

<p>比如谈胡启立就有明显的错误，胡启立和王兆国的结局。</p>

<p>王兆国作为胡耀邦的人，被处理是意料之内，胡启立没有立刻被处理，不是因为胡启立为了政治仕途攻击胡耀邦，而是因为胡启立虽然是胡耀邦的嫡系，但他被钦定接班是邓小平看好的结果。</p>

<p>一直到六四后才彻底放弃，这件事胡耀邦自己也说过，李锐找他谈话有讲过，高新基于这些内容做了反驳，提出是邓力群故意散播的谣言。</p>

<p>如果成书资料是党内记录，那就不可能全都准确，甚至是与可辩证的实际情况完全相反的，胡启立就是很好的例子。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.9</strong> —–2022-10-22 21:31:54+08:00:</p>

<p>因为邓本身既是一个政治保守派，也是一个经济改革派，是一体两面的政治核心。</p>

<p>这就导致可以看到江朱李胡温都有他亲自安排的影子，工作做的差邓不怕，但不听话就会出来敲打，胡耀邦和江泽民都是例子，这也是为什么李鹏做的那么烂，还让他继续当总理的原因。。</p>

<p>只不过在92年开始江泽民倾向陈云开倒车，政治保守的统一，因为经济分歧出现矛盾。</p>

<p>这里要引入一个细节，温家宝是87年十三届就已经进入中委会，到92年才候补委员身份进入政治局。</p>

<p>邓在六四前后（包括六四），三次都接受了温家宝的晋升或留任，虽然较慢，但也反应他的本来意思。跟赵紫阳关系太密切的陈俊生都不被允许入常或有担当副总理的可能，田纪云本来铁定入常，但姚依林和李鹏的干预，邓也是接受的。（甚至不让嫡系万里入常）</p>

<p>这一点上赵紫阳在评价李鹏在六四吹风时，就大概说过邓不可能被人左右意见，他有能力安排的，都是他自己的选择。</p>

<p>温家宝在92年没能成为副总理和后续入常，我认为主要是邓朱的支持，但到了政治层面，李鹏的权重被邓考虑进去，最终没完全让温家宝顺利进入最高层。</p>

<p>另外胡比温家宝早一届进入中委会，资料是要大一些，只不过公职安排不同，温家宝几乎没可能担当总书记，候选人士太多了。</p>

<p>赵紫阳后的换届安排，从赵紫阳本身说出来的方向可以推断，没六四的话，邓的安排可能是这样：</p>

<p>八七年常委：</p>

<p>赵紫阳、万里（总理）、李鹏（人大）、乔石、姚依林、胡启立、田纪云（副总理）</p>

<p>十四届常委：</p>

<p>胡启立（总书记）、田纪云（总理）、乔石、李瑞环、朱镕基、胡锦涛与某人</p>

<p>十五届常委：</p>

<p>胡启立、朱镕基（总理）、李瑞环、胡锦涛、温家宝（副总理）与若干人</p>

<p>为什么说胡锦涛和温家宝并不单纯是临时产物，因为胡锦涛本身，就是中共改革开放后，第一批政府现代化里，年轻干部的首选人物，是当时那批人里最年轻的，在82年39岁作为中委会候补特选进入最高层，85年转正，87年温家宝才参与进来。</p>

<p>两个人资历都非常老，尤其是胡耀邦，82年候补同期，现在这些主要干部里你找不到名字，不是死了，就是没升上来。</p>

<p>所以我认为宋平推荐没那么大影响，宋平推荐给胡耀邦的影响倒是很大，在那之后邓基本也看好胡，才在早期改革开放时就敲定胡作为最年轻的干部进入最高层。</p>

<p>虽然如果没六四，他们的仕途可能有变化，但最后入常，从六四之前的政治地位和党内地位来看，基本没意外了，最年轻的一批人选里，他们都是主要的干部储备，六四有无，牵扯不深都不影响他们。</p>

<p>当时有个标准叫干部四化，明确赵紫阳这些到92年都要退下来，按年龄推算，可以判断92-02则会是胡启立、田纪云、朱镕基等主政。</p>

<p>王兆国可能与胡锦涛竞争总书记，所以两人身份可能替换，但总体而言，如果胡耀邦不失势，到02年王兆国、胡锦涛、温家宝入常分别担当总书记、总理、人大几乎是必然的。</p>

<p>因为干部四化是从八十年代早期就开始铺垫的，党内人事安排有的讨论远比现在多，很多得益于胡赵的公开化，信息也比较全面。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.10</strong> —–2022-10-22 21:42:10+08:00:</p>

<p>因而要辩证看，信息源单一的地方，可以引之用，不能信以实，除非客观上能推断出合理的方向，党内人士地位和履历就是个突破点。</p>

<p>就像不提邓小平，只说温的妥善处事，好似是温挣扎好不易才得出的结果，但实际到最后，只有邓点头，温才能得到其他人支持和入局。</p>

<p>胡耀邦死前李锐找他谈话就反应很多问题，许多人事选择，都是邓亲自安排和筛选的，胡启立就是个例子，反例还有翁永曦被邓干预，从副部开除党籍，赵是支持和提拔翁永曦的，但是事后也无可奈何。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1782.11</strong> —–2022-10-22 22:28:13+08:00:</p>

<p>早期读的这些，现在回头看，第四代对习近平的评价和施政方向，不就很有意思么，胡温某些地方也大抵如此。</p>

<p>以前就有说法陈全国是李克强的亲信，但我感觉七上八下其实一定程度本身也不严谨。</p>

<p>因为农村工作小组还是比较重要的，新疆出来本身也很难升，看履历的话他还是升了的，直接对接到国务院副总理负责的区域，王乐泉和张春贤，都是退下来后先去了一个中央部门的副职。</p>

<p>外界说是酷吏用完扔，这个前提是中共高层的道德观与利益立场跟外界一致，可能在中共高层看来，陈全国是个很用心尽责完成党国体制的人。</p>

<p>他本来党内地位其实也不高，只不过新疆问题被有了关注度，被推到台前，他退不退其实不重要。</p>

<p>当然政治斗争，也可以阴谋论推测，因为跟李克强的关系，本来是被调到国务院下属镀金当个副总理，但是被驳回劝退了。</p>

<p>但现在如果不进中委会，只能推测党内升迁到此为止，差不多到年龄退休，只会给个半退的闲置镀金，就差不多退休了。</p>

<p>我觉得不复杂，就是身体实在是不行了。</p>

<p>一开始可能胡觉得自己可以坐住，结果最后这一段已经没法靠自己顶住了，必须下去休息。</p>

<p>你看胡锦涛起来走路都费劲需要人搀扶，他坐椅子上晕倒或者失态问题更严重，他毕竟是前党魁。</p>

<p>江泽民不出席我觉得原因类似，就是身体状况已经差到无法维持体面了，出于党的脸面原因，党内可能不建议他们出席，而胡锦涛则应该是坚持出席，江泽民就不清楚了。</p>

<p>视频我反复看了几次，发现其实包括王沪宁在内，都不是要拦着栗战书。</p>

<p>现在我觉得是王沪宁的意思，更多是提醒栗战书还要开会，他起来会让旁边的人觉得事情很严重，其次胡锦涛有专人带领，他去掺一手不一定更好。</p>

<p>因为王沪宁看胡锦涛出事后，是全程注意力都在盯着的，除了故意板着脸没看胡锦涛的个别人外，包括习近平在内，离得近的都应该是突然发现胡锦涛身体出什么严重意外了。</p>

<p>我之前以为汪洋他们是一眼没看，但实际后来注意也是有看的，那这里不假设是有矛盾，单纯正常思考一个老人这个状态。</p>

<p>比较大的可能，应该是党内高层都知道，且见识过胡锦涛的病有多严重，很熟悉所以反应不大。栗战书和王沪宁反而可能是没怎么见过所以才紧张。</p>

<p>胡锦涛明显是有些糊涂了，知道还要开会，但是旁边其他人知道他不太行，得劝走休息，双方拉扯过程就比较明显，他状态肯定没法继续开会。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1787.2</strong> —–2022-10-23 01:32:39+08:00:</p>

<p>起身送人走可能也不符合党内规矩，尤其是其实完全有人手特地去扶的情况下，党和国家领导人干这个对他们内部来讲未必得体，所以王沪宁提醒了一下。</p>

<p>休息室肯定有备份的，着急的是让他去休息，胡锦涛还想强撑着开完，就算没有也肯定有人替他拿文件和私人物品，现场的人都不好劝。</p>

<p>党和国家领导人劝这件事不得体的话，全交给工作人员就说得过去了，尽管胡锦涛是前党魁，也不想走，但都看得出他强撑着是不行的，现场几个人话不多，估计对胡锦涛的情况已经知道，没啥好说的了。</p>

<p>如果他身体到时候真的很差，外部压力大，或者突然暴毙，出现政变可能性是不小的，不过这种事没法预测。</p>

<p>习近平我觉得就是要多做几届，不着急人才梯队换代，很多事情外人看起来不留后路，在他们眼里都是不觉得会有问题才这么做。</p>

<p>我觉得他第三任期会开始培育七零后到九零后的一些红三四代进入公众视野。</p>

<p>九零后可能早了些，但八零后到时候换届差不多成熟，中高层位置有限，只要习近平想多做几年，其实就不在乎人员换代，过去是因为每次人员换届，新人上来都可以扩大新势力对政权的掌控。</p>

<p>改革开放初期定的干部四化，可能到这差不多就只是变成程序而已了，不再具备实际意义，变成习近平有需要让你留任多几年也行，或者年轻点提拔上来也一样。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1787.6</strong> —–2022-10-23 04:05:41+08:00:</p>

<p>如果胡锦涛体力坐都坐不住，随时会出现病态，趴桌子或其他无体力后的姿态，这样不得体旁边的人肯定建议他下去，老人逞能不就是跟喝醉了认为自己没醉一样么，胡锦涛如果当众出丑，对整个党的脸面都有损伤。</p>

<p>习近平就坐在胡锦涛身边，现在党魁总书记是习近平，最近距离负责安保的肯定是习近平的人。</p>

<p>逻辑上想就很容易明白，如果胡锦涛的人也被允许在附近，警卫局的人会不会考虑胡锦涛的人突然发难，只要考虑到这种风险，安保层面也有理由杜绝。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1787.10</strong> —–2022-10-23 05:41:00+08:00:</p>

<p>—– <strong>1787.11</strong> —–2022-10-23 05:46:35+08:00:</p>

<p>胡锦涛主观不愿意是肯定的，但跟身边人带他走的动机不一定有关联。</p>

<p>你看他都没注意到栗战书拿他的材料给警卫，以为习近平的材料是他自己的就能看出来。<br />
习近平摁住资料那个举动很直接，就像小孩拿东西被摁下一样，反应他都清楚胡锦涛的行为怎么回事，跟身边栗战书和王沪宁还特地侧身看了一下。</p>

<p>我感觉他就是身体不知名问题，导致不能履行前党魁职务了，我到更不清楚其他解读试图导向的目标具体是什么。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1787.12</strong> —–2022-10-23 07:07:02+08:00:</p>

<p>金正恩处理的是姑父张成泽，想政变换人，金刚上台权力根基不稳，当众办事给其他人看，但事先已经处死对方数个亲信，而且后续有说法指张成泽除了经济与核问题跟金不和，还想换人扶持金正男上位，导致金正男也被杀。</p>

<p>胡锦涛双裸退，习近平特地称赞，现在掌权十年，团派虽然明确已经失势不如从前，但也是除习近平派系外第一大党内团体，胡锦涛本人年老体力不济，过去跟习近平没矛盾还扶持他上位，现在也不产生威胁，也是他开绿灯习近平才快速掌权。</p>

<p>彰显权力，不是把朱镕基和江泽民这群人，无论身体状况全都强行摁在主席台前更好？高层有人有不出席的权力，就说明胡锦涛这个状态到现场是主观意愿。</p>

<p>羞辱李克强到是却有其事，两人经济工作有矛盾，本来可以剪掉的片段央视特别放出来。要羞辱胡锦涛找团派出气，习王栗三日为什么还特地关心，很多地方如果以羞辱为目的，都不合理。</p>

<p>胡锦涛主观不愿意走这件事是肯定的，这种背景下肯定是架走的，但起码胡锦涛到后面也接受了这件事，才跟习近平和李克强最后搭话。</p>

<p>提出我现在的观点不意味着我反对说政治冲突的可能，实际上我一开始看到视频部分也是这么以为的，觉得是习近平看都不看。</p>

<p>但为何王沪宁和栗战书那么关心，习近平本身也扭头去看，这些问题深入辨析后，我自我反驳这关都过不了，逻辑上无法解释，那只能是现阶段有什么说什么。</p>

<p>有人说架走胡锦涛是为了政治立威，那反过来讲，把不能出席的江泽民等人都摁在那不是更好么，而且我一贯观点就是胡锦涛身体衰老的很厉害。</p>

<p>政治上习近平不待见李克强是很明确的，也不会让团派影响自己施政，跟他们的政治联盟算结束了，但按理逻辑上没必要搞胡锦涛。</p>

<p>不了解中共政治状况和习惯会误判，团派跟习有矛盾是非常明确的，拿胡锦涛立威却完全没必要，会堂那群人的反应更多是没把他当有独立行为能力的成年人看待，开幕式连续三次都把胡锦涛放在习近平之后和常委之前，要拿下他就不会剪进去，也不会有习跟胡的互动。</p>

<p>作为团派前领袖，未来随着团派失势和病情加重，彻底被边缘化是必然的，但开幕式的政治待遇已经决定闭幕式上的不可能是安排好预演的。</p>

<p>而且是拍摄途径是非官方，后面官方又通过不同渠道解释胡锦涛身体有病，如果说是欲盖弥彰，那一开始就不会给人看到，只能是不小心被看到才成立，所以故意羞辱立威论站不住脚，逻辑不能自洽。</p>

<p>习近平不能又要推高胡锦涛位置，又要“不小心泄露”，还要特地去找宣发解释。只有当这件事是个非常隐秘不想外传的时候，才有必要刻意解释。</p>

<p>会堂里连官方的摄影师拍摄，他们都不避讳，知道外媒在场也无所谓，只能说明他们自己认为没什么好回避的，警卫拿文件还特地值了和看在场的摄影与记者给胡锦涛，包括栗战书等人一系列行径在我看来就是胡身体出问题顶不住。</p>

<p>因为都没把他当有自主行为能力等人，所以擅自收了胡的文件，胡去拿习的也被习不太礼貌地按住，要是安排好的，习不需要好像特地吩咐一样跟警卫交流。</p>

<p>给胡的名单不一样说要看，这个根本不可能，胡的名单不一样，其他团派都不一样么，就算会场能瞒住（何况开会好几天了），事前事后如果胡有能力发脾气责问习，习也根本躲不过去，要是担心大会上发作，直接不让一个需要被搀扶才能行走的老人出席就行了。</p>

<p>江也没出席，朱镕基也没出席，胡锦涛开幕式状态好一些，习近平坐下前特地扶胡锦涛，看胡锦涛坐下自己才坐下，栗战书也在旁边扶着，胡还特地都两面看了一眼，扶走胡锦涛的警卫也上来捏着椅子。</p>

<p>除非之后有新的证据和迹象，要不然太早下绝对结论然后划立场，不但是操之过急，也是错误的做法，因为这种事根本不着急下结论，起码我是没下结论的，让子弹飞一会才对。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1787.22</strong> —–2022-10-24 15:59:13+08:00:</p>

<p>我觉得是两者都有，边缘化团派，但也不是彻底废除，因为二十大的主席团常委里有一些理论上应该被边缘化的人物。</p>

<p>党内大概分成无所谓的江泽民这种，也根本没能力管，还有就是骑墙派，过去江的一些幕僚，还有就是虽然不太赞同，但党更重要的一些人。另外一群就是肯定不会喜欢这种做法，却也无可奈何，温家宝、李瑞环这群就既明面公开不反对也不赞成做顺水推舟的事。</p>

<p>出席二十大是党员义务，没特别原因缺席是说不过去的，所以江朱不出席是身体原因，与会者不一定都认同习近平的做法。</p>

<p>团派要看之后工作安排，这个需要一两年。</p>

<p>因为现在常委肯定没人了，但国务院工作上是不是团派也一个没有，这个还不能确定，习近平也许是想把团派彻底变成打工人，赶出决策层，如果有这个倾向，之后我们可能陆续看到。</p>

<p>假设他们不抓人，说明只是政治联盟破裂，双方地位不再平等。</p>

<p>抓了一些人敲打，那就是对团派目前的魁首李克强等有意针对了。</p>

<p>我估计团派只剩下用不用，能用多少的选择，没太多自主权，因为决策层没有团派，意味着他们很难从常委任命一些关键领域的自己人接班。</p>

<p>只能是习近平任命你团派的人，至于怎么任命，团派已经失去话语权了。</p>

<p>要是说因为民众怀念早期那十年，并且的确引发了习近平的政治危机感，到时候团派的确可能会被肃清彻底摁死。</p>

<p>至少二十大我们确定一件事，团派在党内靠走程序的常规手段根本无法与习近平对抗。</p>

<p>有说法指出赵乐际的父亲赵喜民是习仲勋的老部下，那么双方可能从小认识，之后陆续有接触，并且习近平在读大学期间，赵乐际也在北京读大学，虽然不是同一所大学，却是同期工农兵大学生，都是四化发展的同期成员，跟薄熙来一样的红二代，陈云路线的受益者，出身就很靠近习近平。</p>

<p>农业转工业的红利可以带来很多好处，日本后昭和时期的蓬勃发展，国内改革开放早期的文化产业，很多地方都有凸显。</p>

<p>其实类似更小的经济体都有相应的情况，哪怕不是发达国家也有。</p>

<p>比如利比亚、叙利亚、阿根廷，这些国家早年都曾经通过销售资源或者劳动力，短期内获得了大量资金，生活水平一度不错，但是随着政权不愿意改革，这些红利很快就消失。</p>

<p>并且他们在市场里的位置被取代，国内的知识分子阶层外流，同时带走了技术以及社会的温和缓冲。</p>

<p>导致政权与基层国民直接摩擦，最后因为内斗不断失去发展起来的机会，导致他们这个失去人口和资源红利带来的转型窗口期</p>

<p>威权主义是一种社会生产秩序的结构体现，古代农业社会人口多，驯化人口服从威权，追寻威权。</p>

<p>而中国虽然工业化很久了，但是人口太多，转型需要较长时间。</p>

<p>如果政府积极推动，转型可能会比较快，否则只能等经济发展，带来的工业化扭转人口中对社会秩序的主流看法，让自由化的价值观更有吸引力。</p>

<p>也即是说，社会制度实际是应社会生产力而变，一旦社会不能再用落后的软件生产，就会倒逼体制改革，但这里能不能继承窗口期继续高速发展，是个问号。</p>

<p>人口少，掉头快，人口太多，体量大，掉头很难。旧政权的门阀贵族换皮，然后慢慢磨损，就跟俄罗斯一样，也不是不可能，所以这种前提下，内部发生一次大规模动荡后，清理这种残余政治集团，可能对整个社会转型更有利。</p>

<p>我觉得国人最大的惯性幻觉就是社会能一直稳定，更详细的说是认为当下社会的制度，以及主流对制度的默不作声，带来的是和平而不是混乱。</p>

<p>所以可以看到国内对一切民运或群众运动都是否定态度，或者阴阳怪气的双标。</p>

<p>那么社会在调头转型时，付出的成本可能远远超出想象。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.1</strong> —–2022-10-23 05:25:01+08:00:</p>

<p>中共从来没有一个具体的权力交接流程。</p>

<p>唯一一次顺利权力交接就是胡锦涛上下台，而且上台也不完全，江泽民恋栈，只有胡锦涛是老实按规则走完流程的。</p>

<p>毛泽东是做到死，四人帮是被政变下台。</p>

<p>华国锋是政治斗争失势，但比较体面。</p>

<p>胡耀邦是被政变下台，正面搞倒有困难，直接不通知开生活会开始批斗。</p>

<p>六四直接军事政变，传统合法性消失，江泽民趁机上台，然后站稳。</p>

<p>结果到胡锦涛第一任期都不愿意放手，江的人还一直安插到习近平时代。</p>

<p>隔代指定本身就是个无可奈何的产物，邓小平在晚年虽然是党内唯一的婆婆，但是路线却十分别扭。</p>

<p>陈云不追求政治改革，也不主张邓希望的经济改革，所以陈云这面保守派别的矛盾小。</p>

<p>邓小平则是希望经济改革，政府和党务手下三个核心嫡系，胡耀邦、赵紫阳、万里，还有一大堆他自己嫡系的改革派，政治改革上全都跟邓相反。</p>

<p>到最后邓为了中共的地位，不得不亲手废除胡耀邦、赵紫阳，万里不入常，自己看好扶持的胡启立被废，结果江泽民就开始阳奉阴违，李鹏这样的经济上也倾向姚依林这些保守派。</p>

<p>导致邓小平不得不出来南巡，后来双方互相妥协，江泽民这样的见风使舵的人才肯改革到底，还废掉了杨尚昆。</p>

<p>整体来说，就是党务胡耀邦被邓小平自己废了，政务赵紫阳被邓小平废了，军队杨尚昆也被邓小平废了。</p>

<p>基本可以说，到现在邓没有任何直接政治理念被留下继承，进入两千年后经济改革也基本停滞。</p>

<p>中共内部的政治派系和理念，最后由陈云一脉完全胜出告终，邓小平只在活着时说了算。</p>

<p>一个是上海帮和李鹏这样的，虽然邓也认可，但仍旧不是他的嫡系，这群人一直过渡到2012年，贯穿整个胡耀邦时代，甚至习近平第一任期都有影响。</p>

<p>而习近平本身又是陈云提倡的红色江山红色子弟路线的最佳人选，大可以理解为上海帮的一些技术官僚，主要是为了给红色子弟接班过渡，管家角色一样能让陈云这群老人安心把权力交给他们子孙后代。</p>

<p>所以邓小平从长远来说，政治上是个很失败的人，经济改革不可能不进行政治改革，胡赵都在改革过程里意识到这点，也反馈给他了，但邓小平经济观点与政治观点不匹配，最后导致一系列悲剧，然后被人摘桃子。</p>

<p>等过几个小时到十二点，他建立的领导人制度崩溃，基本可以宣告改革开放实质性结束。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.2</strong> —–2022-10-23 10:16:12+08:00:</p>

<p>习近平可能不会终身制，但会掌控实权到死，党内有足够权威和嫡系下属，可以跟邓一样不担任实际职务也能形成控制，具体要看状况。</p>

<p>因为身体变差了，肯定有工作没法那么多精力去完成，一线具体行政和到处跑是肯定要有人在习近平年纪很大时去负责的，最后再都交给习近平，他持有最终决策权。</p>

<p>再有他讲述的中共政治未来叙事，是包括红色子弟和红色基因，言下之意培育下一代红色子弟接班也是他的政治目标，只不过具体什么时候接班习近平说了算，不给你接班也得憋着。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.3</strong> —–2022-10-23 11:07:07+08:00:</p>

<p>这个问的好。</p>

<p>重点是要了解权力构成，实际上毛和邓，他们靠的都是实绩和威望，以及部分政治运动带来的威慑，形成一种集体话语权，因为当时政府根本没建制化，也就是说影响力是可以超越职位的。</p>

<p>这跟后来的建制化现代政府完全不同，胡耀邦开始现代化政府后，建制化了各种职务，从他们这一代开始，就都是被选上来的。</p>

<p>但本质还是元老背书，他们背后有一个决定一切事务的元老集团，这些元老的威望很高，可以跨级，不被建制化的政府约束传达命令。</p>

<p>这也是为什么说邓小平按当时情况，六四的决策实际是不合规的军事政变，军委主席给他的是一个名正言顺的话语权，因为不可能整个军队都是你嫡系，但是能直接指挥嫡系，这是很了不得的能力，尤其是军队和官僚只认人不认职务的时候。</p>

<p>六四以后问题就很复杂了，胡赵时期，他们提拔一堆人，邓提拔一堆人，陈云姚依林这群也提拔一堆人，这群人拼在一起组成中共核心和干部预备役。</p>

<p>这就导致实际政治上的出身没有统一来源，派系繁多复杂，又在建制化政府下，没办法单独靠建军建国的威望去调动一些几十年在岗位上的老部下。</p>

<p>当时也没有这些几十年的老人会跟随老上司，因为这群人才上来没多少年，岗位建制化后，用的都是新人居多。邓小平想干部四化，背景就是建国前和早期那批人，在这中共政权里主导太久，一个人三四十岁跟老上司一起参与建国，一直当到改革开放退休，那这种人脉想一下多大的权限。</p>

<p>就不像干部四化后，一届一届不同年龄层运动式上位，这样每一届上来的人，实际能掌权时间有限，这也是换届形成规矩后，对人事安排有最大影响的一件事。</p>

<p>江泽民时期有李鹏和一堆邓时代的老人、年轻高干制衡，并且隔代指定后，胡锦涛还在后面，所以江的权力都来自于他在职务上的便利所提拔的人脉。</p>

<p>到胡锦涛接班时，江不想放权，可问题是跟他资历一样老的很多人还在，这群人就是约束，江就无法跟邓一样完全操控政治。</p>

<p>习近平上台权力有一个快速扩大的阶段，就是第一任期利用反腐打开的政治斗争缺口。这个现在没有非常具体全面的文献可以证实，但是普遍观点是这样认为的。</p>

<p>因为薄熙来新四人帮搞事，被中央知道后，江和胡最后都开绿灯处理这群人，认为他们破坏了现在的既定党内秩序。</p>

<p>同时胡锦涛裸退，给习近平最大的人事任命权，另一方面习近平的一些人，比如栗战书，在上一届已经铺垫蓄力，并不是习近平上台后才纷纷提拔，他是带队晋升。</p>

<p>可以把江胡影响下的习近平第一任期大环境比喻为一个外朝，习近平那些没得到较高地位的嫡系是内朝，然后习近平靠反腐议题，把内朝的权限不断扩大，削减了外朝的干预。</p>

<p>打击周永康令计划这也是胡开绿灯的事，江的人事任命权年代距离太远，也不大好影响，尤其是你们开绿灯，我抓起来反腐，扩大化后他们未必是能反对的，有些官僚腐败一抓一个稳。</p>

<p>实际形成官僚派系的，主要就是那么几个大的核心，你把这些核心干碎了，下面很多人没法跨级联络更高层的人，很容易导致他们开始陷入孤立状态，就像把士官杀了，没有组织的士兵就群龙无首，威胁大大下降。</p>

<p>习近平来回反腐抓了很多年，逮谁都敲打。</p>

<p>而他具备一个其他人没有，或者有也不是很扎实的背景，那就是他是太子党，根正苗红的做事，高层内部讨论肯定是有话语权优势的，陈云强调红色江山红色子弟，许多现在的老干部反而是陈云派系下的产物，跳出来反对很容易被戳脊梁骨。</p>

<p>用一个可能不太适合现代情况的古代例子，就是韩馥跟袁绍。</p>

<p>从制度上利用名正言顺的反腐和红色子弟背景，趁着薄熙来等人打开的政治动荡快速抓紧机会，敲碎中共固有的权力网，胡锦涛裸退后加速了习近平权力扩大化。</p>

<p>反腐是个非常有利的事，因为正常大规模人事变动，无特殊理由，在现代建制化政府都要等换届才能安排，但是反腐可以名正言顺做事，尤其是太子党救自己家业</p>

<p>等扩大后，渐渐产生寒蝉效应，人们不敢出声，基于不敢反抗的权力也就落实了。但凡有人唱反调，立刻加以重刑处罚，无论身份，任志强就是例子</p>

<p>反腐运动后党内都原子化，不知道自己出头的结果，有谁能帮到自己，谁能罩自己，替人干脏活会不会靠山也倒了，权力就都被抓起来了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.4</strong> —–2022-10-23 11:41:15+08:00:</p>

<p>这不好说，但毛泽东晚年其实也不大能控制住北京局面，尤其是周死后，人太老了大多无法有效掌控全局。</p>

<p>不过我觉得习近平如果聪明，会找一些政治运动和政策，把嫡系跟自己永久性捆绑在一起，就跟四人帮一样，四人帮是没退路的。</p>

<p>而且习近平跟江泽民这样的过渡性领导做大不同，他是陈当时指定好的红色子弟，习近平扩大红色子弟保江山，就是保他们，红色子弟如果上台，从出身角度讲，反的几率比技术官僚更低。</p>

<p>会不会死后有赫鲁晓夫就不好说了，这样的经验太多，我估计习近平会严防，尤其是国内的例子。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.5</strong> —–2022-10-23 12:46:17+08:00:</p>

<p>中国很难做到完全的闭关锁国，但会尝试，也就是所谓的控制，名义开放，但把控渠道。</p>

<p>未来不大会计划经济，而是国家资本主义，政府白手套办事，顺便有一些国企适当时候干预，白手套企业基本就是给政府打工的，会在必要时候执行政府命令，农产品市场之前猪瘟就这样干死好多农民。</p>

<p>习近平加速对我来说就是会把党搞垮，因为现在社会大众利益，与党政利益，开始背道而驰。</p>

<p>但党是建立在民众消费与生产基础上的，如果民众无法受益，党也没有办法延续。</p>

<p>短期有利于党的政策，有可能代表未来更深的伤害党的根基，也就是说短期稳固统治，反而可能缩短统治时间，瞎折腾的典型。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.6</strong> —–2022-10-23 13:44:03+08:00:</p>

<p>未来两三代人对宽松环境没有认知这个有可能，但出来革命也会有。</p>

<p>我对新政权出现的前提，都全部建立在一个基础上，就是中共的财政因为客观原因，必然萎缩，导致控制范围收缩。</p>

<p>这个收缩过程，空缺出来的社会管治权，就会被地方势力和一些异军突起的革命者接收，如果中共坚持不改革导致这种局面出现，其中可能就有新政权的建立群体。</p>

<p>不需要大部分人都反，只需要中共自己没钱管不住下面，需要收缩治权范围，让渡给他们认为靠谱的地方势力，双方维持一个平衡，直到地方有能力不听命令。</p>

<p>这个时候地方自己掌握财权，如果大部分人都是甘作服从这，是威权主义下更善于接收命令的那种人，给钱养活军队打仗，实际更顺理成章。</p>

<p>未来如果有内战和政权斗争，对大部分习惯服从命令的人来说，无论他是什么立场，真正斗争的只有少数参与政治的“主动者”在进行，社会的话语权也会来自于他们。</p>

<p>比较可能的情况是，这样的主动者，可能是保守派，可能是改革派，大家通过获得资金，用于在服从者当众招兵买马，作为兵力资本去对峙或抗衡彼此。</p>

<p>这也是为什么社会其实不需要大多数人都一起反对，只需要你管不住，有少数人有能力有心思有资金，聚集到少数人，一旦获得一个地方的控制权，就有能力去招兵买马。</p>

<p>而不一定是全国所有人反抗，跟香港或六四一样大规模社运，逼中共给反应的情况。</p>

<p>其实比较勇的人，和比较木讷服从命令的人，社会上都一直有，中共基层管不住，前者会先冒出来非暴力社运（在前面国人好管的假设里这样的人是少数），如果不成功，可能就会激进化，开始占据或与地方势力合作混合进行组织武装化。</p>

<p>每一个人对自己生活所需，物质、精神和人格尊严都肯定有一条线，这条线你可以压，但不能在现代社会把它压没了，让原本不在意的人，开始在意和抱怨问题。</p>

<p>你换角度想一下，一个人可以没有救济金，可以没有交通补贴。</p>

<p>但是他的儿子不能没有学校，他的父母不能没有医生，他不能没有食物，政府控制越多产业，实际就是越多的把自己怼到民众面前。</p>

<p>主要缺的是串联空间，维稳控制网络和地理空间，要不然现在肯定一堆人直接小船开会了，目前这么做成本很高，那以后呢，恐怕不会永远都是这样。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.7</strong> —–2022-10-24 03:00:22+08:00:</p>

<p>中央对地方加大剥削，其实是个死局。</p>

<p>古代跟现在不同，没有那么多公共开销要依赖地方，而且皇权不下乡，东南互保也只是大员掌控几个大城市与地区，很多地方都是自耕社区，对这种问题都是砌墙。</p>

<p>但现代不同，现代需要公共开销，中共光把沿海省份当血牛抽血还不行，因为事权不对等，大部分事都要地方办理，你搞太厉害，可能80%到90%都没事，91%就立刻因为连锁反应崩盘。</p>

<p>地方没权力，却什么都要做，办事得花钱养人吧，你中央把我们地方的钱全都拿走了。</p>

<p>哪怕说我不反你，但我也的确什么都干不了，只能躺平。</p>

<p>尽管中央是个威压姿态，但这种问题还是必须讲逻辑的，没钱你没法要求他办事，他也的确办不了。</p>

<p>所以其实不需要政治力量背书，有政治力量当然更好，但更多时候是中央慢慢发现管不了地方。</p>

<p>这种情况一般会是一两次危机后，地方有人吃螃蟹冒险不遵从政令，中央如果无法处罚，大家就有样学样不怕了。所以习近平上台后，到处搞纪委巡回小组，挨个地方敲打要求表态，反腐常态化就是为了避免这种情况出现。</p>

<p>一旦有任何不服从的苗头就几十倍力量惩罚。</p>

<p>当然，故意不服从是一回事，可像前面讲的，如果是没钱，中央也知道，地方就有名正言顺的理由躺平了，到时候地方再出现问题，就不是维稳能解决的。</p>

<p>反而可能因为一些地方维稳压力很大，地方会养贼自重（虽然我觉得可能性不大，如果有必然是建立中央已经没钱转移支付，地方财政和安全自己负责，变成会哭的孩子有奶喝的逻辑）</p>

<p>任何减少资金投入的举措，都可能导致社会本来的日子人变成反贼，这是经济吗啡以及公共服务两方面所导致的。</p>

<p>毕竟医疗教育不能丢吧，经济吗啡停下，很多人工作没了，也不行吧。</p>

<p>那就要持续砸钱，还要第三笔财政，用于维稳，第四笔财政用于债务利息。</p>

<p>地方公务员，尤其是教师和医疗人员，他们是编制内最好欺负的，没钱没枪没话语权，医疗人员可能地位更高，所以官方做法是对医保和耗材下手脚，还不敢太明目张胆欺负医疗系统怕大罢工和摆烂。</p>

<p>教师的话，其实整个教育系统，在六四后的体制内地位一直不高，原因都懂，本身就是被提防的角色，体制内的“编外贱民”，人少被控制，串联困难，但又离不开。</p>

<p>相对的，一些大城市其实是不愿意对出身和学历较高的公务员这么搞的，当然大城市对公务员的策略也整体比小城市好，主要是财政比较充沛，但骨子里的逻辑是近似的，因为政策来自于上方。</p>

<p>未来财政困境下，公共财政缩减，应该是这样：</p>

<p>编外人员（外包的一些服务）→教师→医疗人员→政府多余部门→政府非必要部门（环保什么的）→政府主要行政部门→公安系统→军警部门→军队</p>

<p>最后所有钱肯定优先保证暴力机关，但到这个程度政府下台和社会动荡已经开始进入周期，也就无所谓什么秩序不秩序了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.8</strong> —–2022-10-24 03:24:08+08:00:</p>

<p>1.财政萎缩不可逆。</p>

<p>财政主要来源目前制度有两个，一个是企业和消费，一个是地方土地财政。</p>

<p>土地库存优先，市场刚需但能承担的人也有限，过去二十年消耗很多，哪怕未来有也跟不上财政开销增长速度。</p>

<p>企业升级需要的是更开放的政治制度，更好的学术环境和文化氛围，目前政府目的是干死提供绝大部分就业的中小企，让官方扶持的白手套企业垄断。</p>

<p>如果继续经济放权，无可避免要走地方放权，进而被迫倒逼政治改革，中共其实就是不愿意接受这种结果。</p>

<p>赵紫阳他们派学者和干部八十年代到世界各地考察，已经判断出要走这样的路线中国快速发展后才能巩固经济果实，所以最后是政治分歧导致改革完蛋。</p>

<p>2.意识到问题其实不难，但立场决定不能解决。</p>

<p>这个用一个例子，帝制退环境是必然的事，革命党知道，复辟的也知道，但他们的政治利益都绑定在这种路线上。</p>

<p>就跟目前所有人都知道，经济想要继续发展，政府必须改革进行制度升级，才能带来产业转型和更好的公平经商环境。</p>

<p>但是这意味着必须放权，只要放权的，哪怕内部有人知道正确，他们也不愿意去做，因为执政目的就是垄断权力成为剥削阶级。</p>

<p>所以他们的补救方法，都是会绕开真正解决办法的一种拖延。</p>

<p>拖延的办法又可能加深他们积重难返的局面，比如经济吗啡-凯恩斯主义，或者继续大规模发债，然后面对滔天的利息。</p>

<p>要么继续干死民企，获得短期利润，但长期二十年左右他们的处境会更艰难。</p>

<p>就跟江青和华国锋都知道要改革，但右转市场经济，打死他们也不愿意，哪怕陈云他们也知道市场化是有很大好处的，姚依林也清楚，可利益问题让他们很难站到这面。</p>

<p>本朝剩余寿命这个观点目前没变，因为他们有几个关键措施，是常委出来前就确定要走的。</p>

<p>其中一个是税制改革，前几年营改增是加强中央收入，更多地方税纳入中央分账高的范畴力，未来的税制改革是直接税，直接税对接个人，我估计能支撑财政增持至少五年到七年。</p>

<p>这个是可以判断的，但是像疫情这种突然打击经济的事，没法预测，突然冒出来那就是加速。</p>

<p>也就是说，中共经济发展好的一面，财政赚得到的未来钱，大体是可以预判到的，因为来来去去纸面就这些，可用工具很少。（不过民企可压榨利润这个还要看情况，不确定多寡，房企应该是快没油水榨了，互联网企业是当下风口）</p>

<p>但是可能导致经济停顿的事，随时都会突然冒出来，所以常委名单对此影响不大，因为都早有预判心里有准备了，得出的结论也早早基于此。</p>

<p>更多是感叹吧，改革开放正式结束了。</p>

<p>不过出来后还是能说一下的，李强接任总理，团派彻底滚蛋，意味着习近平对经济和国务院行政有直接话语权，没有任何阻碍。</p>

<p>参考上海和蔡奇对低端人口的驱逐，我估计政治运动和愚蠢的行政干预经济的恶果，来的可能比想的更多，上海与北京问题会日常化，所以整体我认为是在加速路上的。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.9</strong> —–2022-10-24 15:14:18+08:00:</p>

<p>改革开放就是当时社会走不下去的结果。</p>

<p>严打和改开前，也就是实际文革时，就是因为社会和政府近乎崩溃，出现大规模不满，以至于毛泽东都无法控制局面，才最终导致内部政治斗争激烈。</p>

<p>最后走向改革开放寻求出路，当时的民间不满情绪已经很明确了，出现大规模示威，四五运动和南京的三二九事件，都是在毛泽东没死时，出现在中国核心城市的民间政治性运动。</p>

<p>后来的学潮、六四，都只是这些社运习惯的延续。并且多地都有民众社运习惯，西单墙和傅月华领导游行示威，各地的学潮和私下结社是非常普遍的。</p>

<p>只不过经济改革、平反以及胡耀邦的开放作风，让这种情况没有加剧，也是为什么胡耀邦死后，民间反应那么大的原因。</p>

<p>因为经济和政治上的宽松让民间感到在改善与进步，平反让中共重新获得了凝聚力，所以当时结社的矛盾并未聚焦在针对当权派系上，一直到后来学潮和六四，才彻底结束了当时民间学生、工人、教师和市民阶级结社的习惯。</p>

<p>包括六四和学潮，还有前面几次事件，实际都是全国性的，只不过规模太小的就很少有人知道，我看很多地方县志或公安志，七八十年代不但犯罪多，结社和私自持有军火也非常普遍。（包括但不限于学社、宗教、邪教、建党、偷窃军火），满洲帝国道德会就曾经以“万国道德会”的形式在八十年代再次复活，试图通过宗教形式建立组织复辟。</p>

<p>改革开放带来的财政增长，扩大了解决问题所迫切需要的公安系统人手，并且有足够行政资源用于建立身份证系统。</p>

<p>以当时的核心重工业城市鞍山为例（理解成计划经济体制下的深圳、广州就行）：</p>

<p>86年有军队士兵与工人结社，盗取军火希望抢劫银行伪装成劫案用作资金，被发现后打算逃到边境出国被抓。（再往后大规模学潮就不记录了）</p>

<p>85年有九宫道结社意欲建立新政权，范围扩大到辽阳、营口等地，但这个教追查应该是五十年代就被取缔了。</p>

<p>83年一个叫李崇盛的人到日本探亲，被国民党情报部门发展为下线，授中尉，在鞍山负责情报对接和发展组织工作（应该是战后在华日本人的后裔）</p>

<p>83-84年缴获枪支147支、子弹13124发、炸药1713公斤、雷管538个。</p>

<p>81年有一个从76年成立的“辽南独立大队”组织，成立了暗杀团，并且选择性爆炸破坏，目标是东北独立和推翻现政权。</p>

<p>80年上半年处理掉的反革命组织和犯罪团伙930个（包括一些黑帮和流窜犯组织，其他目的的组织也涵盖在内）</p>

<p>78年有“寿山万隆天主佛教”的组织，从黑龙江蔓延到辽宁乃至秦皇岛，鞍山一地就有七十多人，同年驻地军队军械库看守员用机关枪扫射看电影的士兵，造成九人死亡。（当年有个一批两打，就是批判四人帮，打击反革命和犯罪分子）</p>

<p>77年中华民族正义党建党，有很完整的简直，基本模仿中共，从主席、副主席、秘书长到军委主席、军委副主席、总参谋长、后勤部长都有。计划抢劫银行获得经费，最神奇的是，还确定了革命纲令，有党旗、军歌、纪律，并且有单线发展的情报部门。</p>

<p>89年后就是通缉工自联和高自联成员，学潮和六四发生后有兴趣我再讲，实际立刻就有反应和有人武装起事了，还有六四前夕用汽车炸弹的。</p>

<p>综上情况，放到现在，相当于深圳每年都能破获一个武装革命或者有类似目的组织，官方其实花了很大力气才没有让这些问题持续做大（主要我觉得还是时代背景很难做大，当时人口流动和信息沟通很困难，且经济在迅速发展，所以非学社类的那种纯政治性组织没空间，也没群众基础，更无核心意识形态。）</p>

<p>其他例子还有很多，一些显示当时社会问题严重的普通犯罪就不列入了。</p>

<p>总体上来讲，当时社会哪怕在这种城市都非常动荡，但伴随而来的，是中共财政扩张后，大规模扩充军警部门，并且建立各类警校，建立完整检查制度的，在各类组织发展前就摁死。</p>

<p>社会和中共财政总体是在往上走，也是为什么这群人始终不能成事的一个关键原因。</p>

<p>如果财政和社会经济长期往下走，发生类似的事，你看下现在辅警为主的城市治安状态，过去人口流动困难，现在发达城市这种组织流向没法控制的小地方，信息和交通发达的背景下，猜猜会发生什么。</p>

<p>社会肯定有具体逻辑，发生某些事总有原因，比如一个人不至死的罪八十年代被枪决，你好奇查为什么，发现有个说法叫严打，单说严打没人知道为什么，那么严打的政治背景、社会背景是什么，从这两点入手找资料。</p>

<p>然后一查，发现严打是因为当时社会犯罪问题非常严重，那么问题又来了，为什么那么严重？再查，原来是文革后社会松动的现象。</p>

<p>跟着看文革结束前后的社会动荡，尤其是政治事件，对比时间线非常重要，经常会出席，本来看起来没关系，但是时间线对上后，居然是有联系的事。</p>

<p>因为我国现代史，尤其是改革开放前后这段是几乎空白的，缺乏成体系的记录，还被人为干预，所以自己找资料拼凑出很重要，重点是历史过程本身是逻辑自洽的，就像上述的严打和改革开放一样，不可能无缘无故的来，总有原因导致，这样线索就多了。</p>

<p>其实这个问题随机性太强了，所以我也不敢给太肯定的意见，这些都是自己要判断的，我只能提供一些思考区域给你新思路，一定要灵活判断，不能把我的都作为判断标准，我也会犯错。</p>

<p>但具体要看你希望往哪方面发展，是想安身立命，还是想在未来如果国内十几年到二十年左右可能出动荡，自己也想出一份力这样的心态。</p>

<p>大体路线又分两者，润出去，你还可以回来参与社会动荡时的运动，也可以在外面生活的很好，但必须考虑润出去可能导致的阶级下滑。（润出去学历受不受当地承认就很关键。）</p>

<p>在国内也不意味着就没有较好的生活水平，不便利的地方都懂我就不赘述了，但在第一线肯定是能更多掌握未来社会的各类状况，你要确定自己能站得住才行。</p>

<p>所以其实分两条路四大类，润出去再回来参与，润出去做日子人。在国内参与，在国内做日子人。</p>

<p>正常情况我认为最好去沿海，产业发达对受高等教育的人需求肯定大，内陆也不是不需要，但能给你的资源可能不会那么多，因为地方的财政和决策权有限，他想给你一倍沿海的待遇也未必拿的出来。</p>

<p>但反过来讲，沿海因为人人都往那里挤，这意味着高学历也要承受内卷的压力，竞争肯定很大，可能也没法那么舒服，这就是官方的一种政策。</p>

<p>不想996肯定外企最好，虽然外企在撤离，但肯定不会全都走掉，体制内你进去，有两个可能，一个是在基层一辈子，另一个是因为你学历较高，有一定晋升可能，到中老年有到中层的可能。（但是体制内人事关系是非常复杂的）</p>

<p>从另一方面讲，体制内现在是香饽饽，但未来呢，大城市我想公务员还是可以发薪水的，至少比其他小地方强，但也肯定有个范围，你能不能保证说自己到时候肯定能靠能力混到这个范围里，哪怕政权不稳定，换新政权，也肯定有你养老金和收入福利在？</p>

<p>起码现在一些编外的，还有教师医疗系统人员是有被挤兑的情况发生，软柿子好捏。</p>

<p>再有就是你也看到了，疫情清零怎么折腾基层公务员的，如果发生冲突，你的工作有没有可能不是办公室坐一辈子，也会被调到前面干这些活，然后被民间的激进状况伤害到。</p>

<p>私企能当上中高层，卷的情况可能就比较少，中小民企会被普遍干碎，有是肯定会有的，但发展趋势目前是国家扶持大企业垄断，对中小民企不怎么搭理。</p>

<p>如果在沿海选，最好是上海、深圳这样的地方，因为混乱肯定是最后发生在这的，如果有大规模混乱和社会运动发生在这些地方还不能被遏制，那说明大的就真的来了，北京通常是不建议，政治核心，未来有冲突风险大。</p>

<p>是必然事件，很多人忽略了一点，都以为红二代是习近平这时候才上台。</p>

<p>实际李鹏那时候就开始了，李鹏本人就是红二代，习近平同期的年轻干部储备，平民官僚非常多，但是红二代也不少。</p>

<p>红二代内部也不是铁饼一块，也有改革主义者，但最后胜利的是保守主义。</p>

<p>在这点上，保守主义技术官僚和保守主义红二代是天然盟友，习近平零几年被确定接班时，党内还有很多老人活着，确保邓陈坚持的四个原则不变，江泽民本身也是李先念和陈云扶持起来的技术官僚。</p>

<p>比起李克强，也只会选习近平这样背景的，而且李克强有传闻争总书记的消息，更多应该看作团派的挣扎，但从历史来看，胳膊拧不过大腿。</p>

<p>人事权上团派一直是劣势，保守派的人事权在六四后就始终是最大优势，胡锦涛也不是那种喜欢折腾的人，本身还是以党的集体利益为原则工作，是个好人但不可能有掀翻天花板的责任感，是被体制驯化的官僚，这个赵紫阳也评价过了，认为温家宝改革意识要好些，结果全中。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.14</strong> —–2022-12-12 15:43:06+08:00:</p>

<p>江泽民推举红二代是个党内保守派路线问题，陈良宇有可能被推上去是个集团利益问题。</p>

<p>也就是说两者其实不矛盾，因为独立于保守派之外，江泽民的上海帮跟陈云那时候的上海帮，已经是两回事了，前者是他自己得势后拉扯起来的一个班底。</p>

<p>在党内也没法归类于保守派别，这个时候就要跳脱党内传统的改革与保守观念去看，更多应该去看执政派系之争。</p>

<p>因为江泽民在自己势力的政治利益上也是有私心，他能的话肯定想办法扶持自己人继续把持朝政，就跟胡锦涛扶持李克强一样，双方都希望在陈云这群老人定下的惯性下能让自己更有机会。</p>

<p>其实有不少人不同意陈良宇会有接班可能，认为年纪太大了等等。</p>

<p>但讨论政治必须考虑到一件事，那就是政治本身是可以不择手段获取胜利的。</p>

<p>他们哪管你什么七上八下规矩不规矩的，谁拳头大谁就说话算，只不过江胡时期没人能一口气独大。</p>

<p>无论是邓小平搞政变的枪指挥党，到江泽民本人的常委扩增，还是后来习近平修宪连任，都说明了只要做得到，情况允许就会来点狠活。</p>

<p>江泽民的上海帮固然是个利益集团，但是也跟红二代家族有很多利益瓜葛，陈良宇如果有可能被推上台，整个既得利益集团的基本盘也还是他们的，就像红二代内部有的是改革派的后代，他们在这个圈子里就不得势，仕途是被排挤的。</p>

<p>最多靠身份地位在小范畴做一些宣传和学术上工作，比如炎黄春秋，这还是要靠一些老人们的保护。</p>

<p>所以能符合集体利益的，陈良宇作为江泽民集团的私利人选被推上去，但最终能保证太子党内的主导群体利益，就也能被接受，同理李克强上位也要接受这样的洗礼和制约，当然他们上台执政风格肯定是要跟现在不一样的。</p>

<p>因为习近平上台在我看来出现一个问题，就是江胡时期对社会政策的收紧，是出于功能性的做法，是基于党的建制利益，是按六四后定下的规矩办事，主观上他们没有非常刻意去挤压，红二代家族在幕后继续捞钱和保持贵族地位。</p>

<p>但习近平不一样，他是直接把红二代那套政治和贵族观念拿到了台前，跟行政系统对接，以此去改造建制。</p>

<p>对社会和政治的收紧，从过去是一种党的建制，变成了党的主观行动，因为过去有这种观点，也是跟实际执行脱节的，大量技术官僚充当前台，野蛮生长时期大家专心捞钱，我想李克强陈良宇上台，也会尽力寻求维持这种趋势。</p>

<p>可能会略收紧，因为后台也会反应剧烈到前台，如果前台执行不到位，可能就会出现换人的情况，但现实情况是江泽民和胡锦涛都做不到完全否定党内某个庞大群体推行的路线，个人利益上让自己人继续上位是好事，但显然他们也不会因此争到完全翻脸。</p>

<p>习近平上位直接把这种后台的危机感和使命感，搬到前台执行，区别只是早晚而已，李克强当总书记干十年，习近平薄熙来俞正声李源潮，这些红二代该进常委还是进常委，而且现实就算因为团派弱势，才让李克强变跛脚总理，也争取不到更多资源了，所以其实避免不了。</p>

<p>无论上面技术官僚保守倾向，还是红一代还活着的老人，红二代退休的李鹏等，还是八十年代选的干部储备里红二代的数量，从上到下都在维护这个路线，有改革观稍好一些的技术官僚上台，在这些人面前也是弱势的，起码我目前认为不会改变红二代上台的趋势。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.15</strong> —–2022-12-12 17:59:32+08:00:</p>

<p>江泽民是个投机者，他并没有具体的政治路线，跟邓小平和陈云都不同，因为他原本就不是作为有自主立场的接班人培养，所以他上位后谁影响大就听谁的，并且遵从集体和党的建制。</p>

<p>个人追求利益，但他还有政治上的本来面貌，本质上江泽民是偏保守的，能接驳市场经济不意味着改革派，跟芮杏文等的不和传闻，以及学潮里保守化的反应都看得出，哪怕不考虑陈云，他也是党内一贯偏保守的作风，所以才能被选接班。</p>

<p>而不单纯是因为有陈云在背后推动，因为江本身就是偏保守，这更多是政治作风问题，而不是他有自己的政治路线要保守，跟胡锦涛一样，也是政治作风保守。</p>

<p>因为给他什么就接什么，实际可以看得出江泽民的执政理念并不清晰，六四后上台了，改革派失势，他的改革就停滞甚至开倒车，邓小平出来南巡就又转向了。</p>

<p>意图结束改革开放这个要看语境，当时还是后来江泽民本身，都提过两种改革开放观。</p>

<p>在这里有两个语境，一个是陈云等传统左派认为的，现在推行的改革开放是要把中国全面西化，走向资产阶级自由化的改革开放。</p>

<p>另一个是坚持走特色社会注意的改革开放，维护四个基本原则。</p>

<p>如果乍看下，会认为邓小平跟陈云其实是完全一条路，反资产阶级自由化，坚持四个基本原则，对吧？</p>

<p>但是陈云这群人并不傻，他们很清楚社会的生产方式与运作制度，决定了社会本质，而不是名义属性，也就是说邓小平强调反资产阶级自由化与维护四个基本原则都不假，在政治上他们在这点意见一致。</p>

<p>可回归到改革开放观的本质，两者是完全相反的，陈云追求的改革开放，只是从六七十年代回归到宽松点的鸟笼经济，而不是全面放弃社会注意走向市场化。</p>

<p>陈云反对这样动底子的事，希望扭转过来，但是胳膊拗不过大腿，因为邓只在政治立场上跟他统一，这就导致党内有两种改革开放观。</p>

<p>说全盘西化，其实就是指市场化，因为人人都知道邓当年反右，政治上不可能砸自己的饭碗，经济制度就是党政的法理主要来源，共产党共产党，要搞计划经济上台，现在不搞了，对党内外法理问题怎么解释，这就是特色社会主义的来由，说白了就是文字游戏。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.16</strong> —–2022-12-12 18:37:04+08:00:</p>

<p>江泽民的问题从哪可以看出来。</p>

<p>最典型的就是姓资姓社的争论，六四后党内政治争议其实平息了，应该没那么多幺蛾子才对。</p>

<p>那这时候党内再起的一切对市场化改革的针对，其实就显然是针对改革本身，而不是党内派系问题了，属于骑到邓脖子上来。</p>

<p>当时主要矛盾在于旗帜和路线争议，经济工作本身则是李鹏主导要求保稳，但是邓希望的是保增长，逻辑上李鹏说法没毛病，但实际是通过保稳来减缓改革增长速度，到后面没办法靠保增长来带动，就开始依赖债务经济了。</p>

<p>而中宣部部长王忍之，他不可能不经过党务最高层的江泽民就去以中宣部部长身份发表社论，几乎就差指名道姓的说了。</p>

<p>邓小平因为要推行社会主义的市场改革，所以处于一个模糊地带，他对此的发言也是说我们认识不清醒不清楚之类的搪塞，为市场化改革做解释。</p>

<p>然后王忍之六四后公开以宣传口首长身份出来打脸说：“社会主义不清楚论’是一种嘲弄马克思主义，糟蹋共产主义政党，向正在开拓通往社会主义之路和正在建设社会主义的广大群众大泼冷水的理论。”</p>

<p>没有胡赵挡刀，这批判就是针对邓小平去的，宣传口是党务工作，江泽民89年接班，但是王忍之从90年初开始，一直骂市场改革到年末，也没人管。</p>

<p>王忍之是什么人，胡乔木的人，跟邓力群这些一起，都是党内保守左派的前台。但是有意思的地方在于，90年时邓还没打算上纲上线，只是也找前台发文批驳。</p>

<p>但是91年李鹏到上海，就开始指责有人提出市场经济，说原来就是计划经济为主，市场调节为辅，现在又冒出来一个什么市场经济，把本来统一的思想都搞乱了。</p>

<p>那这个前提是什么？在邓看来就是六四目的就是为改革开放铺平政治基础，结果我当坏人，你们这面就来享用成果，连市场化都给我踢掉了？</p>

<p>所以邓到91年口吻就开始改变，早期还只是通过皇甫平这样的渠道，找前台的几个改革支持者争论，但是91年开始逐渐升级变成论战，成为政治理论的拉锯。</p>

<p>然后中途有个细节很关键，江泽民要求删除过姓资姓社的内容，有人拿这一点作为江泽民支持邓小平改革开放的说辞，但反而证明一件事，江泽民近两年的时间都有能能力直接管理宣传口主政左派对市场经济的攻击，偏偏到邓开始明确不满发力了，才来收敛。</p>

<p>接着就出现了邓小平找赵紫阳复出，甚至当总书记都可以的这件事，总书记只有一个，如果江泽民干的好好的，支持改革开放，邓小平是不会用赵紫阳这个有风险的老嫡系，要求也不多，就是认个错，要求政治上跟邓小平站齐。</p>

<p>解万英自杀也反应一点，他早不自杀，晚不自杀，非要南巡到十四大确立了社会主义市场经济后，而他当时主笔，上对接驳江泽民党中央的中宣部时，偏偏是《求是》攻击市场化改革最激烈的时候。</p>

<p>而在此之前，争议要点就是不能不清楚，资本主义就是资本主义，社会主义就是社会主义，跟邓小平希望模糊化，好为社会主义政党背景下推行资本主义市场化做铺垫完全相反。</p>

<p>说白了，邓小平这个在党内其实不好说出来，所以要模糊化，结果非有一批人要揪着不放必须说清楚，江泽民在89年后近两年时间里，对此是默认纵容的，到后面邓的反应开始大了，才开始收敛。</p>

<p>胡耀邦执政时，党务上因为靠近八十年代的文革遗风，左派人士的攻击更凶猛，市场改革也刚起步，没实效去打脸，但都胡耀邦在党务上管住给挡下了，唯独在六四后左派又卷土重来。</p>

<p>田纪云和邓本人南巡前后的发言，虽然没点出姓名，都是都瞄准江泽民和李鹏。</p>

<p>经济改革是实质性在当时停滞了，左派在江泽民保护下也开始重新进行论战，直接攻击邓小平本人的观点，尤其是一些文章，是要经过中宣部到中委会这些核心管理机构，李鹏能公开说出那种话，态度就很明确了，江泽民此时管党务，你想一下他纵容左派笔杆子的目的何在。</p>

<p>其实看下邓小平对湖北省委书记关广富说的话就一目了然了、</p>

<p>他开头第一句就是：“你拿出笔来记下我的话。我有几点意见请你转告北京“</p>

<p>这就是典型阴阳怪气了，他找江泽民就一句话传唤约地点时间的事，非要南巡到地方了才让地方省委去告诉北京，直接看邓小平的原话，说的非常严重，连续好几次强调北京。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.17</strong> —–2022-12-12 19:09:13+08:00:</p>

<p>保守有不同语境，所以我这里说的容易出现理解歧义。</p>

<p>一个是左派倾向的保守派。</p>

<p>一个是政治行为保守，这是江泽民和胡锦涛的范畴。</p>

<p>江泽民是政治行为保守，遵从左派倾向的保守派意愿和路线，胡锦涛也是政治行为保守，但遵从的是邓的右倾市场化改革，不像胡乔木万里田纪云这样左右分明。</p>

<p>都是政治行为保守，但是底色不同。就像市场经济改革的语境里，陈云、华国锋、毛泽东，都是保守左派，原教旨社会主义的观念里，陈云提出鸟笼经济，允许一定市场调节，就是在模糊化社会主义。</p>

<p>江本身肯定是不希望单纯做过渡性角色的，所以才搞保留职务以及扩大常委的做法，但胡温能上台，说明邓时期留下的派系立场惯性很大，两股势力夹杂下去，江自己也做不了主。</p>

<p>还确立了社会主义市场经济，邓本人监督到97年，最后邓的名字也写入党章，乔石、李瑞环、尉健行、朱镕基这群支持改革的老人也活的长久，田纪云和万里也是盯着，就变成嫁鸡随鸡嫁狗随狗了，按规矩办事是江胡时期遗留下来的制度惯性。</p>

<p>陈云路线具体是什么，不是说单纯回到计划经济，这是他的希望的倾向，但也放弃了，哪次都争不过邓，这就让邓路线跟陈云路线主要变化来自于子弟人事对政权的干预。</p>

<p>陈云路线是希望红色江山红色子弟，党内很多保守派的老人，他们最后接受市场经济成为主体，知道无法扭转，就更加转向支持这一点，这些人的子弟或者支持的子弟里，有很多都是直接在江的手下被提拔和安排接班。</p>

<p>这样的背景下，红色子弟群体广大，既可以有团派的人，也可以有江的人，甚至只靠这个政治身份处于一个模糊地带，双方其实都有太子党出身的人，就算江胡能站稳脚跟通吃，红二代依然占据一个重要的政治构成，甚至不排除扶持的派系继承人本身就是红二代，比如李源潮曾经一度有传闻过的说法。</p>

<p>所以说这个人想结束改革开放的主要问题，不是这个人跟陈云和胡乔木邓力群有一样的左倾思想观念，而是他的行为和立场上有这样去靠拢过左派，这是不需要人教他逼他，他自己选择的结果。</p>

<p>邓不满逐渐升级，最后公开化，破例南巡了，就开始拥护改革开放，这就是政治上的投机，摇身一变从放纵支持王忍之批判邓的改开理论，到后面南巡后跟反对市场经济的李鹏一起拥护，完成了立场转变。</p>

<p>江是个灵活的人，他默认的反应可以是倾向于保守派，也可以主动参与改革，但如果有制度和集体惯性，他也可以去做市场化改革，赵紫阳时期他就负责这个，从这个背景就不能说他不会去做。</p>

<p>因为他跟胡乔木邓力群这群人不同，这些人捏着鼻子都做不下去，他们政治立场骨子里就反对，所以江泽民不会跟解万英一样自杀，或者跟其他左派一样哭天撼地，因为那不是江泽民的固定政治立场，不绑定他的政治生命。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.18</strong> —–2022-12-12 19:55:16+08:00:</p>

<p>可以这一点大致理解，邓仍然希望市场改革能持续推动社会和行政进步，当然这跟他希望中共永久执政，其实是互相矛盾的，因为他还希望未来社会可以发展的更好，但又能明白政治制度与经济发展到一定程度会互相拖累，所以邓的观点是矛盾的，他的一些发言里有“相信后人的智慧”的逻辑在。</p>

<p>陈云没有这种纠结和包袱，用一切办法保证中共执政地位，经济不行了控制经济，人靠不住就世袭，新闻法用不上就不要用，虽然六四下决定的是邓，但陈云在这条路上选择的下限和长期祸害更糟糕</p>

<p>江泽民走陈云路线，一个是人事上的拥护，一个是早期靠拢陈云的计划经济路线，支持党内左派攻击邓小平改开理论在党内的定位（另外一个回答有说），不过后者最后包括陈云都斗不过邓，所以放弃了，党章敲定总路线，社会发展不可逆，江就成为”坚持改革开放“的总书记。</p>

<p>更长远的区别是，邓在给香港承诺后，继承邓路线的团派，在政治总保守的背景下，曾经给香港选举开过绿灯，江泽民时期则是试图推行二十三条，当然这个时期制约多，纯度还不够，到后面习近平上来纯度爆表，直接就推翻承诺了。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1789.19</strong> —–2022-12-12 20:44:45+08:00:</p>

<p>邓没公开表态过未来是不是就可以放权，他的意思是一定要抓住，但反复表示五十年后中国如何如何，我想在他构思里，到时候未来是中国发展了，变得更好了，就可以找到一条中共存续与发展并存的道路，至于是什么他也不清楚。</p>

<p>他自身是铁定不愿意让中共在他这一代出问题，也厌恶西方的民主制度。</p>

<p>不过从邓对未来的理解，给香港的承诺，以及后来胡温对香港开绿灯可以看出，有一定可能邓是希望把香港作为大陆的试验田，过去是经济试验，现在是政治试验，香港可能就是找到他自我矛盾的一个突破点。</p>

<p>邓承诺，胡温执行，习推翻，如果让我判断，我认为邓是能意识到未来会发生什么的，不允许在这一代发生，其实也变相等于承认未来还会发生，但更远的他也管不了，不喜欢归不喜欢，历史潮流趋势他应该是明白的，只不过也想办法让中共在经济发展的背书下续命更久。</p>

<p>他能意识到市场化改革，政治上迟早要出问题这关键点，反资产阶级自由化除了本身就认同之外，还有很大包袱来自于他反右，拨乱反正有的涉及到他的没给平反，导致拨乱反正如果作为他自身的党内政治法理基础，会显得双标，所以于情于理都不会松口。</p>

<p>不过从赵紫阳这样公开反对邓的决定的人，也被找过复出，只要认错就可以。</p>

<p>要不然赵紫阳如果复出，邓应该不会不考虑到自己死后，赵再给自己来个三七开评价，顺便给六四平反，要不然还找他复出干什么，胡耀邦的死也是意外，下台了但人还在。</p>

<p>再参考香港问题上的做法，说明反资产阶级自由化是邓的个人政治需求，大于价值观需求，所以说邓是个复杂的人，他在六四问题上就该被捶，后续的坏影响遗毒今日，可能让他成为历代最糟糕的领导人之一，但是深究的话，邓的确是希望中国发展的，没有他对改革开放市场背书，也很难坚持走下去，在很多问题上邓也是灵活的。</p>

<p>陈云和习近平这样的，就非常简单了，一条路走到黑，如果假设说六四政变是邓在自己活着时保护自身政治利益的特殊手段，那陈云路线到习近平就是把这种手段常态化，变成阶级矛盾了，经济增长带来合法性的说辞，在胡温时代也基本告终，惯性延续了几年，2015年后开始暴露。</p>

<p>也正是那时候开始，全国的管控和政治干预开始加速，习近平也逐渐整合完内部版图了，经济增长带来的合法性外衣开始褪色，民族主义和大国叙事逐渐成为主流。</p>

<p>有人说名单不一样，胡认为自己被忽悠了，不过文件应该早就看完了，坐在那也有时间反应。</p>

<p>栗战书的照片里是一开始注意到胡什么事，然后有人来带胡走，栗战书拿了胡的文件交给随行，胡反手去拿习近平的文件，被习近平一下摁住。</p>

<p>习近平摁的这个举动非常快且熟练，并不太尊重老人，没把胡当有行为自主能力的人让他碰，看到行为不对就立刻进行矫正，根本没有说“您拿错了”的意思。</p>

<p>包括随行负责人员的动作，直接收了胡锦涛的眼镜，把胡锦涛拽起来，我觉得这些动作的行为逻辑是一致的。</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Boris Bondarev. He worked as a diplomat in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2022, most recently as a counsellor at the Russian Mission to the United Nations Office in Geneva. He resigned in May to protest the invasion of Ukraine.]</p>

<p>The invasion of Ukraine made it impossible to deny just how brutal and repressive Russia had become. It was an unspeakable act of cruelty, designed to subjugate a neighbor and erase its ethnic identity. It gave Moscow an excuse to crush any domestic opposition. Now, the government is sending thousands upon thousands of drafted men to go kill Ukrainians. The war shows that Russia is no longer just dictatorial and aggressive; it has become a fascist state.<br />
But for me, one of the invasion’s central lessons had to do with something I had witnessed over the preceding two decades: what happens when a government is slowly warped by its own propaganda. For years, Russian diplomats were made to confront Washington and defend the country’s meddling abroad with lies and non sequiturs. We were taught to embrace bombastic rhetoric and to uncritically parrot to other states what the Kremlin said to us. But eventually, the target audience for this propaganda was not just foreign countries; it was our own leadership. In cables and statements, we were made to tell the Kremlin that we had sold the world on Russian greatness and demolished the West’s arguments. We had to withhold any criticism about the president’s dangerous plans. This performance took place even at the ministry’s highest levels. My colleagues in the Kremlin repeatedly told me that Putin likes his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, because he is “comfortable” to work with, always saying yes to the president and telling him what he wants to hear. Small wonder, then, that Putin thought he would have no trouble defeating Kyiv.</p>

<p>“Starlink service is now active in Ukraine,” Musk tweeted that same day. This was a coup for Ukraine: it facilitated Ukrainian communications in the conflict. Starlink later helped fend off Russian jamming attacks against its service to Ukraine with a quick and relatively simple code update. Now, however, Musk has gone back and forth on whether the company will continue funding the Starlink satellite service that has kept Ukraine and its military online during the war.<br />
The tensions and uncertainty Musk is injecting into the war effort demonstrate the challenges that can emerge when companies play a key role in military conflict. Technology companies ranging from Microsoft to Silicon Valley startups have provided cyberdefense, surveillance, and reconnaissance services—not by direction of a government contract or even as a part of a government plan but instead through the independent decision-making of individual companies. These companies’ efforts have rightly garnered respect and recognition; their involvement, after all, were often pro bono and could have provoked Russian attacks on their networks, or even their people, in retaliation.</p>

<p>But this is new territory for U.S. companies and for the U.S. government. The Biden administration must now figure out how to harness the power and willingness of these companies in ways that will help, and not harm, strategic interests going forward. To do that, policymakers should carefully consider why companies are getting involved and what the government can do to more meaningfully partner with them to serve U.S. foreign policy interests.</p>

<p>The protests in Iran put the West in an awkward position. The Biden administration has tried hard to restore some version of the nuclear deal that the Trump administration jettisoned. But this deal cannot be salvaged. The Islamic Republic is not an honest broker: it has a track record of cheating (failing, for instance, in May to answer International Atomic Energy Agency probes about unexplained traces of uranium at three undeclared sites) and it has yet to fully come clean on its past attempts to develop a nuclear program with potential military uses. And worse, should U.S. President Joe Biden manage to reach some compromise with Iran, a new deal would fly in the face of his forceful condemnation of the regime’s crackdown on protesters. Any deal would likely release billions of dollars to the Iranian government, funding the same authorities who are viciously attacking citizens in the streets.<br />
Instead, Biden needs to take a clear and forthright stand. He should use the bully pulpit of his office to deliver a major address on Iran—speaking to its people, its diaspora, and the world. Biden should applaud the democratic ambitions of the Iranian people and move beyond the White House’s narrow focus on the nuclear issue to demand that the human rights of protesters be respected. The administration has made the contest between autocracy and democracy a central theme of its foreign policy. Iran should be part of that policy. It is time to encourage the Iranian people to fulfill their democratic aspirations.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">theoryofdoom在2022-10-17~2022-10-23的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-20/theoryofdoom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="theoryofdoom在2022-10-17~2022-10-23的言论" /><published>2022-10-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-20/theoryofdoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-20/theoryofdoom/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

<p>This comment was reported.  While it’s wrong, I’m going to leave it up for instructive purposes.</p>

<p>There are legal reasons why lawsuits associated with vaccine injury <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html">almost certainly will not happen</a>.  Folks who are interested can read up on why, but <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2030600">this is a slightly more detailed explanation</a>.  Here’s another <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/faq">resource</a>, too.</p>

<p>A nurse administering a vaccine wouldn’t be liable for administering a vaccine (or drug product, in general) absent his/her individual negligence.  An entity, such as Walgreens, employing such an individual, would likewise not face liability in the absence of its negligence (such as failure to properly instruct employees on how to administer vaccines).</p>

<p>About the only way the manufacturers could be liable is if they engaged in provable fraud before the FDA.  And that’s an incredibly hard thing to prove.</p>

<p>Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth">rules concerning the scope of questions</a>. However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.</p>

<p>So for example, if you wanted to ask, “<em>Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?</em>” we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask “<em>In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?</em>” we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians">please reach out to us for assistance</a>.</p>

<p>If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you’ve researched so far, what resources you’ve consulted, and what you’ve learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/">Rules Roundtable</a> thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we’d approve. Additionally, if you’re not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources">Finding and Understanding Sources</a>”, which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you <strong>wait for 7 days</strong> and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Obviously, the genocidal action must take a substantial toll on its target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Define ‘substantial’, because wherever you draw the line, <em>someone</em> will find <em>some event</em> that is <em>just shy</em> and ask why that arbitrarily doesn’t count.</p>

<p>Or rather, the key thing is that genocide is about intentions and not about scope.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not enough to prove that there have been cases of forced sterilization because, guess what, there’s been cases of forced sterilizations of Han women too, China is shitty to all of its people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, even beyond the sterilisations, the evidence for specific targeting of Uighurs and Kazakhs (as the principal representatives of Turkic Muslim groups) is extremely clear: there has been overt settlement of Han Chinese people in Xinjiang to out-populate the indigenous population, <em>only</em> Turkic-speakers and Muslims have been placed in concentration camps, there is active suppression of non-Mandarin languages and Islam, including the destruction of mosques, etc. It’s not like China is also trying to force Han Chinese people to drop Mandarin or blowing up Confucian sites at the same time that it’s suppressing Uighur and Kazakh and demolishing mosques.</p>

<p>But on the sterilisation point, that there may be individual sterilisations of Han women does not change the broad trend, that being <a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/abortion-china">antinatalism towards Uighurs and Kazakhs and pronatalism towards Han women</a>, in which reproductive autonomy is curtailed <em>in general</em>, but in distinct ways with different populations, towards ends that are unavoidably eugenicist in nature.</p>

<p>—– <strong>874.1</strong> —–2022-10-12 14:15:01+08:00:</p>

<p>So, there is actually a <em>lot</em> of English-language scholarship on the Taiping both in absolute terms and in contextual – compared to basically any other 20-year period in Chinese history (at least before the 20th century), it is <em>incredibly</em> well-studied in many respects. <em>However</em> only a portion of that makes it out into published monograph form, rather than languishing as unpublished doctoral theses or theoretically accessible but often obscure journal articles. And then only a portion of <em>that</em> is general overview and/or narrative history rather than specialist studies aimed at a broadly academic readership. But, not to fear – it’s why I’m here.</p>

<p>In terms of narrative histories, there are four main options to consider: Franz Michael and Chung-li Chang’s <em>The Taiping Rebellion, Volume I</em> (1966), Jen Yu-Wen’s <em>The Taiping Revolutionary Movement</em> (1973), Jonathan Spence’s <em>God’s Chinese Son</em> (1996), and Stephen R. Platt’s <em>Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom</em> (2012).</p>

<p>Michael and Chang’s book isn’t as problematic as one might fear from its considerable age. Taiping scholarship has only really gone through perhaps one noticeable paradigm shift since then, focussed more or less entirely on the framing and interpretation of Taiping Christianity, which is very important obviously but which I don’t think fundamentally undermines Michael and Chang’s narrative. In a broader sense however, the late 80s onwards also saw a shift towards much greater recognition of ethnic dynamics in the Qing period writ large, and that’s something that is especially noticeable by its absence in the older work.</p>

<p>Jen’s book is prohibitively expensive, a bit dry, and overtly moralising, but it is also the most comprehensive chronology in English, and critically it gives coverage to a number of side theatres that most narratives disregard. This is what you read, <em>if you have every intention of becoming a Taiping specialist</em>. I bring this one up, however, because this book had a significant impact on the next two, which explicitly, if briefly, note that they are only going to offer a partial coverage, precisely because the complete chronology had already been offered by Jen back in the 70s.</p>

<p>Spence’s book puts religion at the front and centre of the Taiping movement, and primarily follows the perspective of Hong Xiuquan. The result of this is a fascinating narrative that explains how Hong Xiuquan’s belief system emerged and in turn took hold within the religious environment of mid-19th century south China. However, these emphases also serve as its limitations: after covering the coups and purges of 1856 that gutted the Taiping leadership for the remainder of the decade, Spence’s coverage of the wider Taiping conflict becomes somewhat scattershot as he comes to focus mostly on Hong Xiuquan himself and his religious writings while isolated in his royal palace. The climactic phase of the conflict thus lies largely undiscussed, or at least very impressionistically.</p>

<p>Platt’s book effectively picks up where Spence leaves off, and heretical as it may be among Sinologists for me to say this, his book manages to be even better written. Platt’s approach is informed quite a bit by the field of global history, and his Taiping War is thus not only situated in the context of the Qing Empire, but also the wider diplomatic and commercial environment of the Pacific amidst the Second Opium War and the American Civil War. That does not mean he is writing a massive comparative history, but rather that connectedness and connectivity is given an extremely prominent role, alongside the largely domestic narrative covering the Taiping reform attempts under Hong Rengan, and the Qing counteroffensive campaigns under Zeng Guofan. But Platt’s narrative is not totally comprehensive: when it comes to the war’s ‘eastern theatre’, he focusses almost exclusively on Jiangsu with very little mention of the campaigning in Zhejiang, amid a general sidelining of the French from the narrative (albeit likely for linguistic reasons); he also, as noted, chooses to start things <em>in medias res</em> in 1859, and while he does an extremely good job bringing the reader up to speed on what is relevant, one may ask whether something might be lost in not considering longer-term continuities within the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>

<p>I would suggest that if you’re trying to understand the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as a religious phenomenon, then read Spence. If you’re trying to understand the Taiping War as an event in the context of wider global history, then read Platt. If you’re trying to get a start-to-finish narrative, read both.</p>

<p>I’ll also throw up some of the more specialist pieces if you want to dig into some more specific aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tobie Meyer-Fong, <em>What Remains</em> (2013) – A harrowing work discussing the civilian experience and commemoration of the Taiping War.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carl Kilcourse, <em>Taiping Theology</em> (2017) – Pretty self-explanatory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chuck Wooldridge, <em>City of Virtues</em> (2016) – Not about the Taiping as such, but rather a history of Nanjing and its place in literary space, with one chapter devoted to the Taiping years and another to the post-Taiping reconstruction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prosper Giquel, Stephen Leibo, <em>A Journal of the Chinese Civil War, 1864</em> (1985) – A translation with commentary of one of the journals of the French naval officer Prosper Giquel, who organised and occasionally commanded the Franco-Chinese Corps of Zhejiang between 1862 and 1864. It’s preceded by a brisk but still reasonably detailed narrative history of the Franco-Chinese Corps and its antecedents, which serves as one of the only English-language writings on French involvement in the Taiping conflict.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Last week’s thread (or the week before) saw a bit of discussion around the new Kenneth Branagh Poirot films, and one user asked why <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> keeps being the one adapted instead of <em>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</em>, which is an interesting enough question that I had a bit of a musing over. I suspect the answer is very simply that the nature of the twist works for the former much more easily on film. The main twist of <em>Orient Express</em>, that being that &gt;!the murder was carried out by <em>all twelve</em> of the other passengers besides Poirot, the doctor, Bouc, and Elena!&lt;, transfers easily to film because of the way the information is presented: you find things out as Poirot and Dr. Constantine do, and so the eventual reveal doesn’t rely on telling you that any prior information is outright <em>wrong</em>, even if there were some red herrings. By contrast, <em>Roger Ackroyd</em> relies on Dr. Sheppard, the book’s own narrator, not mentioning &gt;!what he does in the ten minutes between Ackroyd receiving the letter at 8:40 and Sheppard leaving the office at 8:50, why he took 10 minutes to leave Fernly rather than 5, what exactly he did in the office after the body was discovered, and why he went to the Three Boars afterward (which he doesn’t even tell us as it happens; he only admits to it when he is asked about it the next day).!&lt; Because of that, the impact of the discovery that &gt;!Sheppard did it!&lt; relies on the POV character missing out information by not writing it down as it happens. That’s a lot harder to transfer to film, and I’m unsurprised that ITV opted for a more conventional whodunnit format in their adaptation, even if I’m disappointed they didn’t try. There are plenty of unreliable narrator films of course, but with films you aren’t looking literally through the POV character’s eyes. That kind of missing info probably comes off more as contrivance by the filmmaker than an in-character decision or mistake like it would be in a narrated novel.</p>

<p>—– <strong>1772.1</strong> —–2022-10-16 23:07:52+08:00:</p>

<p>要看怎么定义实权了</p>

<p>建国那批人是靠派系关系，不完全是靠职能，政府职务只是干活的渠道，一直到改革开放以后才全面建制化，过去也没有很严格意义上的现代化政府。</p>

<p>周恩来那派系力量不如毛，但也是很大的，表面顺从不反，私下西纠，毛以后也的确是以周为首的保守派官僚最后取得政治生态胜利，彻底肃清毛派系告终，但周在的时候，毛也一直在，所以不好比较。</p>

<p>华国锋在四人帮倒台后是到顶点，但很快就盛极而衰。总理对他来说只是兼职，主要权力来自于军委和主席身份，而且这两个也抓不牢。</p>

<p>李鹏实际权力反而是小的，因为他总理任期分两个阶段，一个是赵紫阳总书记时期，经济权力都被赵夺去了，第二个是江泽民时期，这个时候党内是有掣肘的。</p>

<p>这里实际有个思维盲区，江泽民开倒车，邓小平出来南巡，大家都聚焦在保守和改革两个方向，里面好像没李鹏什么事似的，一般也不提到他，李鹏经济上更靠近姚依林，政治上实际是邓和陈双向背书，党务有江泽民拉扯，经济上被邓和陈一起拉扯，而且他工作时，刚好很多改革派的人都在位置上，实际权力没那么大。（当然总理和常委总归是很大的）</p>

<p>朱镕基可能很多人以他大下岗时期的政策推动范围来判断，但朱有的是执行权，主要决策仍然来自党内主要的政治派别，他的执行权是很大的，也是基于这一点背书，才能给国务院为首的一系列政府机构进行简化，然后才是国企，国务院和政府本身在他手里管的人其实少了，但是权力也更集中。</p>

<p>温家宝时期比较简单粗暴，包括改革也是，可用的经济手段和经济增长标准，在朱镕基时代的，他后来的一些表态算摊牌了，不政治改革成果就要倒退，基本到温时代，许多经济改革没有政治改革是无法推行的，而党内也没有朱镕基时代的强力政治背书（或者说生死存亡的迫切性，因为再改只能改底层政治设计了）</p>

<p>到最后改革整体就两个方向，要么放权简政，回归八十年代路线，要么与民争利，拿改革开放的发展成果当血包，吸干后走一步看一步。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1772.2</strong> —–2022-10-17 00:23:14+08:00:</p>

<p>另外借题发挥，说下李鹏对政府结构和财政，再到后来延伸影响到国企一刀切大下岗有多少关系和长期负面影响。</p>

<p>很多人不清楚朱镕基上来是给李鹏擦屁股，以及为什么是朱镕基来擦屁股。</p>

<p>都以为朱镕基是按部就班上位是安排好的。</p>

<p>赵紫阳在国务院和总书记时期，安排的两个国务院秘书长，一个人是嫡系田纪云，一个是黑龙江省书记陈俊生（就是他写信给赵说党内应该有制度和法律去安领导体系）</p>

<p>田纪云按路线，应该接赵紫阳的总理班，但是被李鹏顶掉，后来吃六四挂落也没入常，稍微低一等的朱镕基，被赵紫阳插在上海，抓国企和打击计划经济桥头堡的工作。</p>

<p>91年朱镕基担当副总理时，田纪云还在，就工作经验也该是田纪云升总理去处理朱镕基后来负责的问题。</p>

<p>但这里出现一个问题，胡耀邦下台后，赵紫阳担当总书记，李鹏竞争总书记失败，反而担当总理。</p>

<p>六四后，江泽民实际可能更接近于一个过渡性角色，李鹏依然想当总书记，比如瞧不上江泽民这些的风言风语，也即是说在不出意外的情况下，调一个快退休的人员上来，江见风使舵就体现在开倒车上，南巡后邓陈互相妥协，才逐渐增补胡、温、朱等人进入核心圈子，江朱之前是同期同事，胡温比较早进入中委会，但温家宝很晚才得势。</p>

<p>也因这个原因，李鹏不可能甘心退休，自然在总理位置留任，最后任期限制只能转任人大，而总理连任时党内反对意见很大。</p>

<p>为什么说朱镕基是擦屁股的，这个形容是比较粗暴，但他跟江泽民原本都是很难有机会进入政治局，更别说常委。</p>

<p>赵紫阳时期，国务院四个副总理四条腿，田纪云、万里两条往右，姚依林、李鹏两条腿往左，李鹏甚至可以说是不懂经济的，直接导致改革虽然在推进，但是却普遍埋雷，保守派拖后腿现象严重。</p>

<p>最典型的一个地方，赵紫阳对债务问题是控制的，李鹏把债务当作一种资源，超发滥发，经济过热不会控制，然后导致一潭死水，国企吃重大，陷进去出不来。</p>

<p>赵紫阳主政时和下台早期到90年为止，债务年发行是约40亿，执政近十年，总发行量是395亿。</p>

<p>李鹏完全自主当总理从91到93年，其中最多的一年的发债量就高达395亿，年均发债305亿。</p>

<p>也就是说李鹏主政的第一年，发债就约等于赵紫阳政府发债近十年的量，对三角债推波助澜。</p>

<p>李鹏第二任期开始，年均发债高达1461亿，什么概念？</p>

<p>是赵紫阳政府的近五十倍。</p>

<p>以至于政府到1995年时债务付息近百亿占收入14.2%，97年就拟近两千亿，高达23.3%。</p>

<p>政府这个时候都要完蛋了，才几年工夫就被李鹏搞成这样？这里还有田纪云和朱镕基的拉扯都拽不住。之前姚依林做副总理主导时，李鹏都没这么大破坏力，两个人顶多 合伙拖后腿，比如对国企的改革和试点的拖延，最后也就导致双轨中单轨进度落后（计划经济市场改革迟缓，十年后衍生出国企问题）</p>

<p>这个时期中国经济还没现在这样发达，金融市场不成熟，可用的财政工具很少，还有国企拖累，三角债没解决，企业也不可能有未来，经济更不会有长远发展。</p>

<p>朱镕基进入高层是六四后的一种权衡安排，但是越过田纪云是不寻常的，因为李鹏在全面控制国务院后很多地方都搞砸了，朱镕基才有邓的背书，又有上海工作经验，才作为后手安排替李鹏擦屁股。</p>

<p>十三届中委会以来，李鹏和胡锦涛是唯二连任四届的常委，朱镕基两届常委，却有一届是副总理身份，总理只干了一届，按常规安排他至少该再担任一届，但是胡温是同期入局的。</p>

<p>所以换个角度，也可以理解为朱本身就是邓安排的过渡性角色（过渡不代表不重要，因为接的是胡温，处理的是最重要的经济问题），那目的是什么，在知道李鹏问题后但因为政治问题不能更替他，又不能让田纪云上，也不可能让赵紫阳复出，那么朱镕基的定位安排就很清晰了。</p>

<p>我甚至怀疑第十五届中委会的安排不一定完全是邓的意思，后来吴邦国在常委路线如果看之前和之后，应该是总理排名第二，但却沿用李鹏的人大委员长排名第二，导致温家宝成瘸腿总理排名第三。</p>

<p>想来这不是邓愿意见到的结果，温家宝在87年十三届中委会里已经进入核心圈子，哪怕吃六四挂落，也应该在十五届跟胡锦涛一起露头，结果是李鹏留下改任，少一个名额不说，尉健行和李岚清也突然冒出来，两个人其中一个或全部，可能都不是邓死前原定的十五届常委人选。</p>

<p>所以只看字面工作时间，不看工作优先级，主政的政策谁在主导，很容易造成误判盲区，朱镕基如果当副总理时就主持经济工作，根本不需要后面舔着脸得罪人搞一刀切政策，当时禁止债务扩大和抓产能改革不就得了，为何债务扩大问题持续到李鹏任期结束才着手管理？</p>

<p>朱镕基是瞎子看不到这几年的债务增速？如果是他一手把控经济负责，难道跳出来反对自己导致的债务吗？李鹏改任人大这件事，就说明既不想走，还不愿意背锅（然而人大是橡皮图章，李鹏转人大实际就是不想退但职务上已经让权的体现），他党内政治地位与影响比很多人预料的要大，早期受改革派限制，经济上实权小（相对赵紫阳），但六四后在政治决定经济的方针下破坏极大。</p>

<p>可以看到六四后债务发行虽然很夸张，相对后面都不算离谱，第三总理任期后放飞自我，尤其是政府换届后，田纪云退下后，朱镕基能影响的有限，所以不存在他上副总理就立刻抓经济，几年后自己跳出来给自己过去几年“发行债务”的烂摊子收尾。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1772.3</strong> —–2022-10-17 12:08:54+08:00:</p>

<p>按权力班底改组而非名义换届选举算，因为遇到了不正常的权力斗争，李鹏在十三届初次当选常委，六四后权力洗牌的89年十三届四中全会形成第三代领导核心。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1772.4</strong> —–2022-10-17 16:08:50+08:00:</p>

<p>胡赵政府着手现代化改革，中国在胡赵改革开放前，是没有现代经济和现代政府的，只有周在建国时，试图推动建制化，但掣肘和后续政治运动太多。</p>

<p>所以胡赵影响力非常大，长远影响在未来只会盖过毛邓，因为赵制定现代改革的经济框架和人才储备，抓准了具体方案，提前为进入WTO做努力，试图改革货币政策。胡则留下现代化政府，大量的行政官僚储备，党务作风的改变。</p>

<p>现在中共基本就是吃这套遗产，快吃完了还止步不前，以后政权更替也肯定是因为这套遗产吃没了，无法改革导致出现的内部分裂或外部动荡，因为三十多年前已经明确宁可流血内战也不改革了，无论谁赢，都必须走回胡赵当年早就预见的老路上。</p>

<p>—– <strong>309.1</strong> —–2022-10-10 21:24:00+08:00:</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Kevin Rudd, President of the Asia Society, in New York, and previously served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Australia.]</p>

<p>Xi has brought that era of pragmatic, nonideological governance to a crashing halt. In its place, he has developed a new form of Marxist nationalism that now shapes the presentation and substance of China’s politics, economy, and foreign policy. In doing so, Xi is not constructing theoretical castles in the air to rationalize decisions that the CCP has made for other, more practical reasons. Under Xi, ideology drives policy more often than the other way around. Xi has pushed politics to the Leninist left, economics to the Marxist left, and foreign policy to the nationalist right. He has reasserted the influence and control the CCP exerts over all domains of public policy and private life, reinvigorated state-owned enterprises, and placed new restrictions on the private sector. Meanwhile, he has stoked nationalism by pursuing an increasingly assertive foreign policy, turbocharged by a Marxist-inspired belief that history is irreversibly on China’s side and that a world anchored in Chinese power would produce a more just international order. In short, Xi’s rise has meant nothing less than the return of Ideological Man.</p>

<p>These ideological trends are not simply a throwback to the Mao era. Xi’s worldview is more complex than Mao’s, blending ideological purity with technocratic pragmatism. Xi’s pronouncements about history, power, and justice might strike Western audiences as impenetrable or irrelevant. But the West ignores Xi’s ideological messaging at its own peril. No matter how abstract and unfamiliar his ideas might be, they are having profound effects on the real-world content of Chinese politics and foreign policy—and thus, as China’s rise continues, on the rest of the world.</p>

<p>—– <strong>310.1</strong> —–2022-10-13 00:08:14+08:00:</p>

<p>[SS from the essay by Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Chair of the Centre for Defence Strategies. From 2019 to 2020, he was Minister of Defense of Ukraine.]</p>

<p>The West must join Kyiv in aiming for an unequivocal Ukrainian victory. It should recognize that Ukraine’s military is not just more motivated than Russia’s but also better led and better trained. To win, Ukraine doesn’t need a miracle; it just needs the West to increase its supply of sophisticated weaponry. Ukrainian forces can then move deeper and faster into enemy lines and overrun more of Russia’s disorganized troops. Putin may respond by calling up additional soldiers, but poorly motivated forces can only delay a well-equipped Ukraine’s eventual triumph. Putin will then be out of conventional tools to forestall losing.<br />
Outside analysts worry that before facing defeat, Putin would try to inflict massive civilian casualties on Ukraine, seeking to coerce the Ukrainian government into making concessions or even into surrendering. He might do so, Western analysts fear, by continuously targeting densely populated areas in Ukrainian cities with long-range missiles—as he has done this week—or through carpet-bombing raids. But Putin lacks the resources to truly level Ukrainian cities. Russia’s remaining inventory of conventional missiles and bombs is large enough to cause substantial damage, but it is not big enough to destroy swaths of Ukraine. And Ukraine has already proved that it will fight on even when Russia reduces cities to rubble. Putin destroyed Mariupol, ruined large parts of Kharkiv, and launched thousands of strikes on other cities and regions. The damage just made Ukrainians more committed to victory and closed off chances for negotiated settlements.</p>

<p>—– <strong>311.1</strong> —–2022-10-14 22:23:57+08:00:</p>

<p>[SS from the article by Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He is the author of China’s New Red Guards: The Return of Radicalism and the Rebirth of Mao Zedong.]</p>

<p>A key question that the congress may well answer is just how much further Xi is going to push the system toward a personalized dictatorship. Although much has been made of Xi’s cult of personality, it is a rather banal cult with very little personality. No one is yet paying tribute to Xi in the form of mangoes, as many ordinary Chinese did to Mao after he received a gift of the fruit from a Pakistani delegation in 1968. But if Xi claims new titles at the congress, such as party chairman, and if Xi Jinping Thought is formalized in the party’s charter, it would mean Xi is so unconstrained and so focused on consolidating institutional and political power that he fails to see the dangers ahead, and those around him are unable to do anything about it.<br />
It was, until very recently, an established truth in formal party historiography that the trappings of absolute power under Mao had nearly brought the country to ruin. Imperfect efforts to address this—term limits on the office of the presidency, abolishing the title of party chair—have either been rolled back or reconsidered under Xi. This does not, however, make Xi a new Mao. The men are drastically different in temperament, outlook, and style. But the governing pathologies unique to the CCP system accommodated both of their pursuits of unchecked power.</p>]]></content><author><name>ForeignAffairsMag</name></author><category term="Reddit" /><category term="Reddit" /></entry><entry><title type="html">EnclavedMicrostate在2022-10-03~2022-10-09的言论</title><link href="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-09/EnclavedMicrostate/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EnclavedMicrostate在2022-10-03~2022-10-09的言论" /><published>2022-10-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-09/EnclavedMicrostate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nodebe4.github.io/opinion/2022-10-09/EnclavedMicrostate/"><![CDATA[<ul id="markdown-toc">

Why didn’t this lead to a legacy of Chinese primacy in terms of innovation and dominance in firearms production?</a>, submitted on 2022-10-07 15:20:19+08:00.</h3>

<p>—– <strong>861.1</strong> —–2022-10-07 17:11:59+08:00:</p>

<p>This is a question that has perplexed many, and there is unlikely ever to be a perfect answer. What I will offer here is a summary of the chronology suggested by Tonio Andrade in <em>The Gunpowder Age</em>, one which many including myself have issues with, but where it is, on the whole, one of the only major attempts so far at covering the entire period in question <em>and</em> to offer structural explanations for Sino-European divergences.</p>

<p>Gunpowder was not originally understood as an explosive or a propellant, but rather as an incendiary. Different ratios of carbon, sulphur, and nitrate lead to different rates of combustion, and early Chinese formulations generally leaned towards slower and more exothermic mixtures rather than prioritising rapid gas release the way that a specifically propellant powder would. This function is also given away by the name – whereas English <em>gunpowder</em>, French <em>poudre à canon</em>, and German <em>Schießpulver</em> all highlight the use of gunpowder in firearms, Mandarin <em>huoyao</em> literally translates to ‘fire medicine’ or ‘fire concoction’, with its outright explosive properties being a later innovation. This would reach fruition in the fire-lance (<em>huoqiang</em>) in the 12th century, originally little more than a bomb on a stick, but made increasingly sophisticated, with some versions designed essentially as fragmentation devices, with metal, stone, or ceramic fragments wrapped around the explosive charge. But at this stage, the gun did not yet exist.</p>

<p>The gun, if defined as a reusable tube which uses a propellant charge to launch one or more projectiles, is first definitively attested in northwest China in the 1280s in the form of a small hand-cannon. These devices quite plausibly may have derived from experiments in making reusable fire-lances. But the gun also quickly found its way to Europe, quite probably via the Mongols, as guns of various sizes are attested in Europe by the 1330s, appearing in both textual and visual records, and would see considerable use throughout conflicts such as the Hundred Years’ War. In short, any head start China had on firearms development quickly waned because guns were adopted in Europe without much delay.</p>

<p>What then needs explaining, though, is why Europe seems to have developed much more sophisticated firearms sooner. There are a number of possible arguments, some cultural and some material. Andrade’s suggestion is what he calls the Chinese Wall Thesis: Chinese walls were generally earthworks several metres thick, which are hard to damage or destroy with siege equipment, and especially not by bombardment; in contrast, European walls were generally masonry works rarely more than 2m thick, and thus much less resistant to the sudden impacts of cannon shots. As such, European states developed more and more powerful cannon as a replacement for trebuchets to destroy walls, whereas that kind of incremental development couldn’t get off the ground in China. Instead, gunpowder continued to be used for its incendiary properties, with mechanical engines like trebuchets used to lob burning projectiles over the walls and into the wooden structures behind them.</p>

<p>A potential quibble from the cultural side is that trebuchets had never been used to destroy the walls themselves, but rather protective structures <em>on top</em> of them like crenellations; that said, there is a reasonable suggestion that the ease with which cannons damaged crenellations would have been taken as a sign that the underlying structure might also be vulnerable, and as such the leap would not have been considerable.</p>

<p>However, Andrade suggests that East Asian states regained a level of parity with European gunpowder technology by about 1600. Importation and adaptation of Portuguese and Dutch firearms designs, combined with domestic innovations, gave the Ming Empire in China, the Joseon Kingdom of Korea, and the Japanese warlord regimes access to a variety of cutting-edge military tools. Not all used the same weapons to the same extent – the Ming prioritised artillery over small arms, Japan the reverse – but there was a stretch of time from, say, the mid-16th century down to the early 18th, when Europe and East Asia engaged in a sustained exchange of military expertise that allowed the latter to keep relatively up to date. This equipment would be put to use in a whole slew of conflicts that engulfed the region, from the Sengoku conflicts in Japan to Ming and Korean wars with tribal neighbours, climaxing with the ‘Great East Asian War’ of 1592-8 when Toyotomi Hideyoshi led most of Japan into a war with Korea in an attempt to conquer China. While peace reigned in Japan after the last few battles of the Sengoku Jidai in the 1610s, the Asian mainland would see the rise of the Qing Empire in the wake of the Japanese invasion, which secured Manchuria proper by the end of the 1620s, subjugated Korea in the 1630s, and conquered China proper in the 1640s-60s before turning its sights on the Eurasian steppe. Thus, Japan and Korea would fall somewhat behind as their untested militaries ceased to have a major role, but the Qing empire retained the impetus for reform and improvement.</p>

<p>The resumed divergence occurred with what he calls the ‘Great Qing Peace’, and this is where I have somewhat more quibbles. The suggestion is that prolonged peace in East Asia obviated the apparent necessity for military innovation, with the last of the major Qing campaigns being that against the Zunghars, concluding in 1757, and leading to a long period of relative peace until the Opium War in 1839-42 and the Taiping War in 1851-64. This extended peace meant that China simply no longer needed to develop new weapons or keep pace with Europe.</p>

<p>This I can see making sense for Japan and Korea, but for the Qing empire this falls a bit flat. Huge amounts of resources would be expended in campaigns in Burma in the 1760s, against the Jinchuan hill tribes in the 1770s, and against Vietnam in the 1780s, campaigns that were openly championed as demonstrations of the empire’s martial credentials. And yet, the Qing do not appear to have invested considerably in the improvement of military equipment as a result. Nor is it intuitive that the earlier Zunghar campaigns <em>did</em> necessitate better weapons.</p>

<p>So, how do we explain a Qing-era divergence in military technology? One possibility is it was indeed a divergence in technical capacity, in terms of not only metallurgical techniques but also basic underlying skills such as technical drawing and ballistic measurement. But there are also institutional factors to consider: perhaps the Qing, whose regime was incredibly low-tax compared to Europe and lacked important financial instruments such as a national debt, simply could not afford such modernisation; or perhaps concerns over domestic upheaval and ethnic decline made the Qing state unwilling to issue better equipment to potentially unreliable Han Chinese soldiers, as well as prioritising more traditional arts, namely riding and archery, among the Manchu elite corps.</p>

<p>In turn, if there are institutional arguments for why China and Europe diverged in terms of weapons technology from 1700 onward, this could be grounds for reappraising the divergence from c. 1400-1550 in more institutional terms. Whatever the case may be, the critical point is that a technological head start does not inherently last forever: as circumstances change, innovation may occur for some societies much more rapidly than others in the same timeframe.</p>

<p>This is where things move beyond my specific expertise, unfortunately, as I’m someone more on the institutional than the technical side of things.</p>

<p>—– <strong>861.3</strong> —–2022-10-08 05:39:27+08:00:</p>

<p>I’m afraid my specific expertise is largely confined to the period of the Qing and the pre-Qing Manchu ascendancy; that said I do think there is credibility to the idea that the late Ming/early Qing parity was more a process of importation than innovation. However I don’t feel qualified to comment on the full longue duree back into pre-Ming states.</p>

<p>—– <strong>861.4</strong> —–2022-10-08 05:41:20+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s an interesting question and one that may find a more helpful answer from a Europe specialist. My impression is that naval developments certainly did drive a lot of innovation at least in the organisational sphere, but I don’t know how well that translates to firearms technology as well.</p>

<p>—– <strong>861.5</strong> —–2022-10-08 05:42:43+08:00:</p>

<p>We’re talking matchlock arquebuses and cast, non-bored cannons. In terms of basic techniques, artillery was about to lag behind Europe, while small arms were some six decades out of date, with the flintlock starting to predominate in Europe by 1700.</p>

<p>—– <strong>861.6</strong> —–2022-10-08 05:44:13+08:00:</p>

<p>I don’t think the Darwinian argument necessarily holds a lot of water. The Qing certainly did face existential threats but they perceived them as internal. I’d also stress that with the argument as formulated by Andrade, the Zunghar Wars, even in their final stages when the Zunghars did <em>not</em> existentially threaten the Qing, were the last hotbed of innovation, whereas the other late Qing conflicts were not, not even the White Lotus Rebellion which was not a full-on existential threat, but still threatening enough to warrant huge expenditures.</p>

<p>—– <strong>861.7</strong> —–2022-10-08 05:44:26+08:00:</p>

<p>Well, hardly ever.</p>

<p>—– <strong>861.8</strong> —–2022-10-08 05:59:38+08:00:</p>

<p>So this is something that first requires a counter-question: were not the Zunghars, too, not particularly well-equipped? And yet the formulation, as phrased, states that the Zunghar wars were the last one requiring innovation in military technology.</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that Burma certainly did have access to European weapons. Quoting a footnote from Yingcong Dai’s ‘A Disguised Defeat: The Myanmar Campaign of the Qing Dynasty’:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 1760s, Myanmar had been exposed to Western penetration for many years. From India, the British were eager to expand into Myanmar, which brought them into conflict with the French, who were also proactive in imposing their influence on this country. Through trade with the Western countries, Myanmar had ready access to the advanced European weapons. During the war, they had used all these weapons, along with traditional weaponry and war vehicles such as elephants to battle the Manchu Bannermen, who still used old-fashioned fire weapons and bows. The Myanmar armies even used land mines in the war, which gave the Qing troops much headache. There are a number of accounts on the Myanmar’s use of the Western weaponry in <em>Mian dang</em> (e.g. the 33rd year, 2/66; 2/89).</p>

  <p>But I saw it in the ITV adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express, where Poirot was a lot more callous and judgmental than he came off as in the book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I watched that last month as part of a general watch through the entire ITV Poirot series (now finished), and I suspect there’s two elements at work. The first is that the series itself has its own internal chronology, with the stories adapted out of publication order, and by Series 9 at the very least, Poirot has become a mite more cynical and jaded than in the mostly quite light early episodes when the short stories were being adapted. Basically once the Hastings/Lemon/Japp trio stop appearing as regulars, there’s a noticeable tonal shift, but there’s shades even before that, given the specific liberties that ended up being taken with <em>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</em> in S7. <em>Orient Express</em> was adapted during the penultimate series (S12) so it’s well into that tonal shift. The second is that Suchet himself noted that the version of <em>Orient Express</em> he filmed was intentionally much more serious in tone than the 1974 Albert Finney film, so it’s also in large part an attempt to differentiate itself from what was the definitive adaptation of that particular story for the screen.</p>

<p>—– <strong>864.3</strong> —–2022-10-11 23:02:34+08:00:</p>

<p>It’s kind of interesting how Suchet viewed some of his predecessors, or at least what he said in the <em>Being Poirot</em> programme he did alongside the final series. In particular he noted that Peter Ustinov came ‘very close’ to being the definitive Poirot, though in what sense he meant that, the programme didn’t clarify. That said, Suchet quietly elided the fact that he had been Japp in one of the Ustinov adaptations!</p>

<p>I guess it depends what ‘well-known’ is. Until Josh Strife Hayes covered it, I suspect very few people would have known about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uHJYTpcUxs&amp;list=PLEpisdBgNpviZ1viroWuBVjZFyPGrBufR">Otherland</a> – I certainly didn’t! It’s very weird and I don’t actually get the plot, but I understand that at least <em>part</em> of it is about cults and WWI until it then becomes a thing in an East Asian fantasy virtual world that is also a hub for a bunch of other virtual worlds and then it was never finished.</p>

<p>—– <strong>864.7</strong> —–2022-10-12 04:32:21+08:00:</p>

Shinso-gumi is made up in large part of adult entertainers and is apparently known for being quite edgy already, so it’s apparently kind of par for the course in terms of the nature of the content.</p>

<p>Given that the reuploaded version removed references to the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion and the Hindenburg disaster (the latter specifically having Kiara, as in an Austrian, depicted on the Hindenburg-equivalent, when the original Hindenburg was operated by Nazi Germany), I wouldn’t call it ‘innocuous’ as such.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting one – I think the potential critical difference between Sana and, say, Marine, Suisei, or very recently Ina, is the <em>nature</em> of the health issue. Their health issues were/are temporary in some regard and could be resolved with rest, but a back injury can have seriously permanent consequences. A big part of what sets the more notable Japanese agencies apart, Hololive most prominently but far from exclusively, is live concerts and other 3D events. Sana may have recovered well enough for streaming and art, but there’s a potential limit to that recovery, it’s highly plausible that she came to regard this injury as one that prevented her from being involved in the <em>other</em> side of Hololive, especially with a new concert in the cards by early the next year and Council likely being on the list for appearances, given Myth and ID1’s appearance in the 2021 one.</p>

<p>假设不用，持续僵持，普京任期到2024年结束，他想明目张胆继续连任，国内又会出现一大股反对浪潮，对于这点我想普京是骑虎难下的，原本并不认为他可能冒险，但现在看普京赌徒心态严重，如果他不赢就要所有人鱼死网破，不排除要进行全球核打击为威胁，要求各方做出有利于他个人政治生涯的让步。</p>

<p>乌克兰军队也会杀死和虐待俘虏，只要是军队有血仇都无法避免出现这种现象。</p>

<p>尤其是2014年吞并克里米亚后，相当于乌克兰的918，乌东民兵主动武装分裂制造矛盾，迎接俄罗斯投去的权柄，其真实目的现在也已知，是吞并整个乌克兰。</p>

<p>导致政治上立场无可调和，乌东民兵是分裂死硬派，乌克兰原亲俄势力在亚努科维奇前还能跟亲欧派拉扯摇摆，俄罗斯入侵克里米亚后，亲俄势力要么分裂要么闭嘴，分裂的其中一部分也不喜欢俄罗斯入侵的行为，另一部分则更激进开始寻求全面武装，并且实质性接受俄罗斯援助公开独立。</p>

<p>今年俄罗斯入侵后，乌克兰境内原亲俄势力更没法站得住脚，很多人已经跳反，让政治亲俄派别消失，剩下的就是武装亲俄分子，这群人是没有谈判余地的。</p>

<p>一个纯粹威权的社会，哪怕社会层面有自由化的苗头，需要完全过渡到一个自由化政府，也是很困难的。</p>

<p>因此需要借助威权化的民主，慢慢过渡到新的社会形态。</p>

<p>它可以是多方制衡的结果，也可以是当权者自觉下放权力的结果，但无论哪种，对于人口众多，习惯服从指令的威权化社会，更重要的是建立足够不被颠覆的政府基石，一个能接受自由化，同时可以充当威权社会管理体系一部分的制度。</p>

<p>并不需要每个民众都理解他的合法权益或选举权，因为多数时候你去对他们科普，他们也不会去记，因此重点应聚焦在让他们明白有这种权力，并且需要尊重获取这种权力的基础，来形成一个社会共识，以此凝聚法理认知。</p>

<p>社会的民主化其实就是生产力的进度体现，农业社会氛围十足的社会，所能产生的政治体制，肯定是基于农业社会的最大效率，也就是威权。</p>

<p>在这个过程里逐渐过渡到工业社会的过程，我称之为威权制度，相比帝制时代更开放，因工业化而共和，进一步发展则从威权过渡到自由化，进而逐渐建立体系。</p>

<p>美国熊猫派的观点我认为没错，他们实际是做到了，但是这个关键问题，需要数十年逐渐体现。</p>

<p>因为在国内有大量的保守主义者和威权主义者，其中的既得利益集团们，拒绝接受现代化，利用和压榨现代化的好处，用以提供资源去对抗现代化。</p>

<p>这种左脚踩右脚的发展方式迟早是要失灵的，但是社会基础已经打下，人们见识到经济的发展和红利，哪怕停滞也会因经济驱动模式的改变，逐渐推动到下个社会生产力所需的环境，进而以各种形势倒逼改革，比如经济下滑的对外战争（如日本），被迫放权、政变。</p>

<p>十几亿人的威权社会，很难一下建立一个高度自由化的环境，可能本世纪前五十到七十年，都是在旧政权废墟上重建法理共识，让人们接受这样的一个客观制度是最佳运行方式。</p>

<p>所以我的判断是，我们这一代到下一代，主要负责的就是社运后、战后的废墟重建，以及如何快速从颓废中追回中共拖延的经济发展进度，建立一个长期法理共识，执行最基本的自由化，在这个过程里，会有相当多的人仍然是习惯于服从或发布指令的威权主义，想过渡其实就要理解这个现况，否则步子很容易跨大扯到蛋。</p>

<p>墙内的说法是错的，或者说偏离原意。过去需要殖民，是因为原材料生产受限，本地能生产但无材料，并且其他地区没有对应的进出口贸易，各国都在寻求确保工业原材料供应的方法，殖民就是最好的办法，可以有效宣示所有权。</p>

<p>以英国为例，为了更好管理殖民地和生产原材料，会对当地人口进行开化工作，展开教育和一系列基建，同化也能降低英国管治成本。</p>

<p>后来随着技术带动社会发展，这些地区本土意识开始形成，并且全球航运出口贸易到了能不用殖民地也可以支撑工业的程度，对殖民地管理反而需要更多的开销，政府的权力本身也是不断缩减的，所以许多殖民都是得不偿失，因而放弃这种落后的经济模式。</p>

<p>中国不需要，是因为中国足够庞大，虽然不是所有所需生产原材料本土都有，但是足够在客观已有的社会沉淀秩序下发展，人口足够多，得以形成一个稳定的劳动力供给源。</p>

<p>无论是建国时，还是改开时，都没有什么客观必要必须对内“殖民”，剥削农民和城市人口，区别对待的本质，都是为了方便政权获得大量资源去执行某些政策，或者是保证他们自身安全。</p>

<p>也就是说，不去剥削这些资源，社会也能自然发展，你剥削了获得的资源推行的政策，其中有那么一部分在建国早期三十年有推进，不代表这样做是正确的，恰巧现在很多人以偏概全。</p>

<p>说没有前三十年的“原始累积”，就没有改革开放的快速发展。</p>

<p>这种话术纯扯淡，改革开放的快速发展，就是对外出售中国庞大的劳动力和消费市场本身，十几亿人内部经济不活跃，大量闲置劳动力，与外部接轨刚好一买一卖才有大量资源涌入，靠劳动力换取许多产业技术、零件、经验。</p>

<p>就像是不是一定有奴隶，美国才能发展成世界强国一样，答案显然不是，奴隶只是方便奴隶主和既得利益者而已，方便他们落后的旧生产秩序。</p>

<p>不同时代道德可能有不同评价，但殖民行为就跟资源少，饥荒开始吃人一样，都是生产力和社会发展到一定程度后解题方法。</p>

<p>共产主义的社会观不能一方面要剥夺私有财产，同时默认资本的存在本身就是不纯洁的，那获取控制他人人人自由与劳动所得对这个权力本身，用道德观批判是更不纯洁的才对，所以法治社会才有必要性。</p>

<p>洗脑我想谈不上，有的是不断学习和认知革新的事。</p>

<p>归根结底问题在于中国、俄罗斯、伊朗以世界岛东侧为核心的新联盟出现，虽然目前不紧固，但是会因地缘政治利益，尤其是内部经济问题导致对外转移矛盾而逐渐密切起来。</p>

<p>被迫捆绑在一辆战车上，因为他们的政治结构有相似性，遇到的问题也有相似性，甚至解决办法可能都是跟七八十年前一样，通过对外转移来暂时获取苟延残喘的机会，代价是把人类拖入第三次世界大战。</p>

<p>纯粹的威权政府很难有效处理内部社会矛盾，也无法适应经济结构的不断变化，进而蔓延到管制层面，出现政治危机。</p>

<p>中国目前的政权竭力避免卷入公开性的对抗，也是因为他们不想冒失去统治权的风险，过早把最终手段摆在台面，但对内舆论上，鹰派已经逐渐占据上风，对抗性思维已经浮现，只是缺乏一次历史事件走到台前。</p>

<p>从中美贸易战以来，各国也隐约感觉到因为政治和文明形态的差异，双方很难只靠经济层面的合作来耦合彼此关系。</p>

<p>外部世界我们中国人管不了，也无暇顾及太多，除了不希望最终走向核战外，更切实及的是要避免第三次世界大战的前奏，把中国人卷入一场巨大的冲突。</p>

<p>这会导致中国失去改革开放以来的所有先发优势，上个世纪末，中国的改革较早完成，并且有成功的方向，得以淘汰错误改革的苏联、改革晚且落后的印度，从而获得一个庞大市场快速发展。</p>

<p>但现在印度改革正在完善，东南亚市场明确崛起，中国也到了经济转型、产业转型的关键节点。</p>

<p>如果我们不转型，最终经济压力会变为对内的政治压力，强迫现在的政权寻求生存道路，从六四来看，大概率不是和平改革放权，而是对外寻求武装冲突来转移矛盾，也符合现在对内的舆论方向与社会管制政策。</p>

<p>我想国内社会并没有做好准备去应对攻台，但政府已经在积极蓄力，为有必要时可以随时执行做许多准备，目前中方明面上对俄的猪队友行为还是较收敛的，国际秩序被大幅度推翻前，因为法理问题并不愿意在予以太多公开支持，不过私下国内舆论大家也清楚官方态度。</p>

<p>当俄罗斯与乌克兰战争走向某个结局，时间线也许刚好来到中国需要转移矛盾的前夕。</p>

<p>我们要解决这种问题的最好做法就是与现政权解绑脱钩，没人会希望改革开放以来的一切经济优势都不复存在，并且在可能的新冷战封锁里，变成超大号墨西哥，看着印度和东南亚崛起取代自己原来的位置吧。</p>

<p>至于俄罗斯与乌克兰，我认为过早过晚结束可能都不适合，太早结束，俄罗斯可能会稳住，普京下台或不下台都有人可能革新内部后试图再次入侵周边国家，用更大的力量点燃火药桶，为攻台做铺垫。</p>

<p>太晚结束，直接顺滑过度，只是猜测归猜测，很多要看具体情况。</p>

<p>当下脱钩和经济围墙已经不可避免，恰是中国最需转型的时候，这对我们非常不利。</p>

<p>所以我想重要的不是注定发生的事，而是怎么快速从中恢复，未来政权怎么在新国际环境下找到自己位置，及时止损，避免印度与东南亚后来者追上，否则提供给十几亿人口充足的就业和养老金，在没有土地财政可支配的环境下，是几乎不可能完成的一件事。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1759.2</strong> —–2022-10-11 17:19:48+08:00:</p>

<p>坚持土地财政的原因之前那个回复里提到了。</p>

<p>这里主要说一下我对土地财政的其他看法。</p>

<p>土地财政是不可持续的，中国不缺地，却把土地当作一种稀缺资源贩卖，那么就必须制造人为稀缺性，一个是把人往一起撵，一个是有限度出地。</p>

<p>本来这种土地储备应该是作为长期发展的一种重要储备，但现在全被挥霍出去，会带来一个直接问题就是私有产权争议。</p>

<p>因为就算中共下台，新政府不能否定所有卖出去的土地产权，这样就导致现在滥造的一些楼宇，还有水平差到没有的城市规划到处都是（这个是我非常心痛的），千篇一律毫无美感。</p>

<p>最主要是哪怕未来新政府上台，你要承认这些私有产权，就没法对城市进行重新规划，然后就面临香港问题，许多老唐楼从战前用到现在都没法拆，街道规划也跟不上，因为产权摆在那，你回收不但要考虑他购入时的成本，还要考虑多少年后通胀了，跟着业主还想在通胀基础上赚回当时购入的本金。</p>

<p>那政府得花多少钱才能回购啊？现在很多城市有土地财政都回购不起。</p>

<p>未来土地财政被挥霍后，哪有钱去回购一到三线城市然后进行重新规划，很多人怕不是宁可留个烂尾楼也不愿意放弃产权。</p>

<p>原本的城市规划也是为了集中政府职能权限而粗暴创作出来，现在想拆分政府职能提高效率，避免扎堆，也根本没法拆，没钱没地。</p>

<p>还有供楼的人，要是遇到经济、战乱或社运等导致的断供潮，政府恐怕都没任何预备资金可以用于救济，别说救这群人了，救银行都未必做得到。</p>

<p>中共的做法，就像把一个瘾君子，对所有借贷机构把能拿到的钱全部用各种名义骗到手，花光所有的积蓄和借款，卖光所有值钱的东西，连房契都抵押用于吸毒。</p>

<p>然后病发死亡、被杀或者自杀，无所谓了，我死后哪管洪水滔天。</p>

<p>跟着一家子一分钱没有，房子也没了，连借贷都没资格，还倒欠不知道多少钱。</p>

<p>那么，换成政府，新政权上台，发现可用的财政工具全部都被上一个政权挥霍没了，或者某些渠道也被拉黑了，巧妇难为无米之炊，新政权只能硬撑。</p>

<p>这个硬撑的过程，国家还要面临人口老化带来的劳动成本上涨，如果我们没产业升级抓住这个机会，同样的位置可能被东南亚和印度取代，再想翻身就很困难。</p>

<p>到时候一没人口优势，二没可用财政工具，三产业链里没有自己的独特位置。</p>

<p>那二十一世纪后续的时间，中国就会陷入长期的萎靡不振，印度和东南亚后来居上，跑到国际文化里成为比中国文化和市场更主流的存在。</p>

<p>改革开放几十年的心血，岂不尽皆付之东流。</p>

<p>—– <strong>1759.3</strong> —–2022-10-12 00:34:00+08:00:</p>

<p>还是要看具体情况，届时政府接盘的债务和政治冲突是否剧烈</p>

<p>假设是一个新的统一政府，解决大部分利益集团能推行改革，对大家斗有利的一些改革推行应该没阻力，尤其是户籍制度和土地财政的解绑，但还是会有的，尤其是来自城市部分人群。</p>

<p>最大问题是不能确定是否会出现大规模断供潮，这部分按理是无论如何都只能硬撑。</p>

<p>新政府会面临一个财政困境，是财政紧缩，还是赤字继续推动经济。</p>

<p>紧缩的背景上述已经说了，没有可用财政工具，除了税收或者找日韩欧美借债，国内可用的财政捉襟见肘，不紧缩可能政府运行都很困难。</p>

<p>当然行政权下放也可以一定程度解决这个问题，地方自己搞钱嘛，但我认为大刀阔斧做改革，太早完全放开只会让地方利益集团巩固起来，不基于中央推行的地方改革，不知道会有什么牛鬼蛇神出来。</p>

<p>财政赤字，没工具，中共都挥霍了，也没打下财政升级转型的好基础，甚至在不断摧毁。</p>

<p>可能举债或适当放水可以靠未来还上，赌赤字推动的消费能苟到下一轮经济发展起来去靠通胀抵消。</p>

<p>但是…….现在放水也很严重了，中共基本是奔着整死现行经济和社会秩序去饮鸠止渴的，等他们完蛋了，社会层面已经没什么可以用的好渠道，这是最大问题。</p>

<p>大概率还是要赤字的，避免一个经济问题连锁反应，保障就业和不断供，银行保住后企业贷款哪怕保守，也起码还是有的，经济能小范围扩。</p>

<p>至于哪里有更多就业，不可能不依靠国外，因为产业升级目前还不够，有理论但实践是另外一回事。</p>

<p>解绑户籍可以为城市带来大量的劳动力，有可能把一二线以外的低价值或废弃土地利用起来，可怎么找这个驱动力呢，现有势头下，我看只能对外求援了。</p>

<p>这个前提是尽可能不牺牲国民生活质量的前提下的选择，如果非要抛弃一部分人保住尖端的那部分，政治上会有极端化群体出现，也不符合区别于中共的初衷。</p>

<p>另一方面也不清楚中共公有和私有家族资产具体多少，清算能捞回多少，这个假设前提还是基于你新政权是在社运或正面战场击败旧政权的前提下，如果只是换皮，显然一分钱都不会从新政权手里拿出来。</p>

<p>能清算，清算多大范围，地方小家族的资产怎么算，不反抗投诚肯定也不能清算人家，到时养老和医疗会有多大窟窿，我觉得是个非常头大的问题，明显可以看到钱不够用。</p>
